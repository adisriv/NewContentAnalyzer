[{"title": "Admissions Scandal: When \u2018Hard Work\u2019 (Plus $6.5 Million) Helps Get You Into Stanford", "content": "\nSitting in a plush chair and wearing a white blouse buttoned up to the neck, the young woman looks into the camera, smiles and offers advice about getting into a top American university.\n\n\u201cSome people think, \u2018Didn\u2019t you get into Stanford because your family is rich?\u2019\u201d the woman, Yusi Zhao, says in a video posted on social media. It wasn\u2019t like that, she says. The admissions officers \u201chave no idea who you are.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cI tested into Stanford through my own hard work.\u201d\n\nThe video was recorded in the summer before Ms. Zhao began her freshman year, in 2017. It now stands in sharp contrast with recent news: that her parents paid $6.5 million to a college consultant at the center of an international college admissions scheme, according to a person with direct knowledge of the investigation.\n\nProsecutors say that the consultant, William Singer, tried to get Ms. Zhao recruited to the Stanford sailing team, providing a fake list of sailing accomplishments and making a $500,000 donation to the sailing program after she was admitted.\n\nThe payment to Mr. Singer was by far the largest known in the case, and the disclosure immediately added Ms. Zhao and her family, pharmaceutical billionaires from China, to a cast of powerful figures swept up in the scandal, including two Hollywood actresses and prominent names from the American legal and business worlds.\n\nThe new turns in the investigation, including reports that another family from China paid $1.2 million in connection with their daughter\u2019s application to Yale, have illuminated the global reach of Mr. Singer\u2019s operation and the wealthy Chinese families eager to get their children into prestigious American universities.\n\nMr. Singer was far from alone in trying to profit from soaring demand in China for the elite American college experience. Many Chinese families turn to middlemen, whose fees can be tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, like some of their counterparts in the college consulting industry in the United States.\n\nIn China, a dizzying array of companies offer advisory services that range from the legitimate to the openly dishonest \u2014 promising, as Mr. Singer did with some of his clients, guaranteed admission to certain schools in exchange for payments.\n\nA private club down the street from the Zhao family home outside Beijing was lined with advertisements for admissions consulting and SAT test-prep services. One company, called Capstone, offered \u201c100 percent university clients accepted into 40 Top U.S. Universities.\u201d Across the street were several businesses offering university consulting and tutoring; one had posted a list of the colleges and boarding schools where its clients had been admitted: Yale, Brown, Andover, Groton.\n\nBusinesses like these have boomed in China as the number of Chinese international students has steadily grown in the United States. In 2017, there were more than 363,000 Chinese students enrolled in American universities, more than a third of all international students, according to the Institute of International Education.\n\nJack Chen, a marketing executive for the Institute of Chinese Language and Culture, which offers college consulting and tutoring, said companies like his help students get reference letters, write essays and prepare for interviews. They also advise children on how to build up their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to include charity work and competitions that separate them from their peers, he said.\n\nMr. Chen said he knew of consulting companies that could find back doors into top universities in the United States, but he declined to disclose their names. He added that there used to be more of these services, but that American universities had cracked down after several cases of cheating by Chinese students on standardized exams and college applications.\n\nBut it was perhaps the college consultants in the United States who had greater sway with Ms. Zhao\u2019s parents, and the parents of the student in the Yale case, Sherry Guo. Both families pursued Mr. Singer\u2019s services after meeting him through financial services companies in California, where he had formed relationships. Ms. Zhao\u2019s family was introduced to him by an adviser at Morgan Stanley named Michael Wu, who the company said had been terminated.\n\nFederal prosecutors have so far charged 50 people in the admissions case, in which wealthy families are accused of cheating on college entrance exams and bribing college coaches to designate students as athletic recruits. Mr. Singer has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges, and has cooperated with the government in gathering evidence against his clients and others he is said to have worked with.\n\nProsecutors have not brought any charges against Ms. Zhao or her parents, nor against Ms. Guo or her parents. Both Ms. Zhao, who was a sophomore at Stanford, and Ms. Guo, who was a freshman at Yale, were expelled from their schools.\n\nA statement sent on behalf of Ms. Zhao\u2019s mother by her lawyer, Vincent Law, said that Mrs. Zhao and her daughter were victims of Mr. Singer\u2019s scheme, and that Mrs. Zhao had believed the $6.5 million was a legitimate donation to Stanford.\n\n\u201cThis generous act was not only done for the good of the school and its students, but also done out of the love and support of Yusi by a caring mother,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIt added that Mr. Singer had not offered guaranteed admission to any school and that her daughter had applied to and was accepted by a number of colleges \u201cthrough ordinary channels.\u201d\n\nA visit to the Zhao family home outside Beijing and a review of online records pointed to the world of luxury and privilege that Ms. Zhao had grown up in. But the family also publicly espoused an ethic of hard work and not falling back on inherited wealth.\n\nA Ferrari, Tesla, Bentley and Land Rover sat parked outside the house, a California-style mansion surrounded by trees and a large hedge, in a gated development called Yosemite Villas.\n\nMs. Zhao\u2019s father, Zhao Tao, said in a 2015 profile of the family in a Chinese magazine that his children did not have their own fancy cars. \u201cIf they want to drive, they have to borrow one from me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI really look down on those kids who don\u2019t rely on their own abilities,\u201d he added. \u201cIf I come across one, I give them a dressing down right away. I just can\u2019t stand that type.\u201d\n\nMs. Zhao\u2019s older sister, Zhao Yuchen, said in the same profile, \u201cFrom early on we\u2019ve been taught that the family\u2019s money is the family\u2019s and is none of our business. We can get the best education available, but if we want to live better off, we have to earn it ourselves. When we traveled, the adults went first class, for sure, but we kids had to ride economy in the back.\u201d\n\nMr. Zhao is the president and co-founder of Shandong Buchang Pharmaceuticals, a drug company that specializes in traditional Chinese medicines and health supplements. He started the company with his father in 1993, and it has become a family enterprise, employing Mr. Zhao\u2019s brother, wife and elder daughter. A profile in Forbes lists Mr. Zhao\u2019s net worth as $1.8 billion, describes him as a citizen of Singapore, and says he received an M.B.A. from Fordham University.\n\nIn a statement released by the company on Friday, Mr. Zhao said: \u201cThe arrangements for my daughter\u2019s studies in the United States are a matter for me and my family, and the source of the funds has nothing to do with Buchang Pharmaceuticals, and will not have any impact on the financial situation of Buchang Pharmaceuticals.\u201d\n\nMr. Zhao\u2019s father, Zhao Buchang, was himself at one point accused of bribery: He was found by prosecutors to have paid $10,000 in 2002 to a senior official in China\u2019s food and drug administration who was sentenced to death for corruption in 2007.\n\nMr. Zhao is also on the board of a group, called Wisdom Valley in English, which says it provides support and advice for Chinese family businesses. Through that group, Mr. Zhao met and posed for a photograph with President Trump and Melania Trump in 2017.\n\nHis daughter went to elementary school in Beijing before going to England for the latter part of middle school and for high school, where she attended a prestigious boarding school.\n\nAs a freshman at Stanford, Ms. Zhao was part of a selective academic-and-residential program called Structured Liberal Education, a yearlong intensive course in Western literature and culture and the history of ideas, according to Rob Reich, a professor of political science who has given lectures in the program.\n\nThe 90 freshmen in Structured Liberal Education live together and attend lectures by humanities scholars from across the university. According to its website, the program \u201cencourages students to live a life of ideas in an atmosphere that emphasizes critical thinking and interpretation.\u201d\n\nShe also belonged to an organization called the Stanford Speakers Bureau, which brings high-profile speakers like Jennifer Lopez and Ban Ki Moon to campus.\n\n\u201cShe was very friendly \u2014 and very dedicated,\u201d Alexa Ramachandran, 18, a freshman member, said of Ms. Zhao. \u201cShe would go around to the dorms, asking if there was anything more she could do for the club.\u201d\n\nIn the video Ms. Zhao made about getting into Stanford, which is over 90 minutes long, Ms. Zhao said that she rode horses in her spare time, and that she planned to take sociology classes at Stanford and return to China after graduating.\n\nMs. Zhao repeatedly exhorted her viewers to work hard and believe in themselves, using her own journey as a lesson. She said that she had been a mediocre student in elementary school and that her first ACT score had been unimpressive.\n\n\u201cA lot of people told me, \u2018You still want to get into Stanford, but, look, the entry rate for it is just 4 percent \u2014 just forget it,\u2019\u201d she said. After a year of strenuous study, she said, she took the test again and got a score of 33 out of 36.\n\n\u201cBased on my experience of study, I want to tell you that really anyone can do it,\u201d she went on. \u201cI\u2019m not the kind who was born with a very high I.Q. or who can score 33 or 36 in an exam just like that. But I made my way up step by step, through my hard work.\u201d\n\nShe decided to aim for American universities, she said, because they evaluated students not just based on test scores, but also on their extracurricular activities and personal statements.\n\n\u201cIt demands not only that you\u2019re a good student, but also that you have personality,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to have a special skill.\u201d\n", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/us/yusi-molly-zhao-china-stanford.html?searchResultPosition=1", "time": "May 2, 2019"}]
