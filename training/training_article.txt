[{"title": "TPG Says Executive Introduced Colleagues to College Admissions Scheme\u2019s Leader", "content": "\nAn executive at the investment giant TPG who was charged in a huge college admissions scandal introduced colleagues on the firm\u2019s deal team to the scheme\u2019s ringleader, but nothing came of the business discussions, TPG said on Thursday.\n\nTPG also said it planned to strip the executive, William E. McGlashan Jr., of most of the profits he was due from funds he oversaw.\n\nThe disclosures, in a memorandum to employees, followed an internal investigation into Mr. McGlashan, whom TPG said it had fired last month after he was implicated in the admissions scheme. (Mr. McGlashan has insisted that he resigned before he was fired.)\n\nFederal prosecutors have accused Mr. McGlashan, one of TPG\u2019s biggest stars and a powerful Silicon Valley investor, with paying $50,000 to a charity run by the businessman William Singer in exchange for getting his son extra time to complete a college-entrance exam. He is also accused of agreeing to pay $250,000 to ensure his son\u2019s admission to the University of Southern California as a football recruit, although prosecutors have said he did not follow through with that scheme.\n\nLawyers for Mr. McGlashan have indicated that he plans to fight the charges of money laundering and fraud against him. A representative for Mr. McGlashan did not have an immediate comment.\n\nIn the memo, TPG, which has more than $103 billion under management, said Mr. McGlashan had met with Mr. Singer in early 2017, and then introduced him to colleagues to discuss potential business ideas. The introduction was made before the admissions fraud that federal prosecutors say Mr. McGlashan participated in, according to the firm.\n\nThe TPG deal team quickly decided against working with Mr. Singer, the memo said. Two other TPG employees did hire Mr. Singer, but for what the firm described as legitimate college-counseling services.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the process and deal team worked as they should, free from any undue influence by Mr. McGlashan or knowledge of unethical or criminal behavior in Mr. Singer\u2019s businesses,\u201d a TPG spokesman said in a statement.\n\nTPG also said in the memo that it had determined the financial terms of Mr. McGlashan\u2019s severance based on the documents governing its funds. He will lose all profits he would be owed from the firm\u2019s Growth and Rise funds \u2014 potentially millions of dollars \u2014 but will retain any stake in the firm itself that had already vested. The Growth fund has invested in technology darlings like Uber.\n", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/business/dealbook/tpg-mcglashan-college-admissions.html?searchResultPosition=2", "time": "April 25, 2019"}, {"title": "A Mystery Solved in the College Admissions Scandal: The Family Who Paid $1.2 Million", "content": "\nOne of the mysteries of the sweeping college admissions fraud case has been over the families that prosecutors say paid the biggest sums to a college consultant at the center of the schemes but that have not been charged.\n\nThe 33 parents charged in the scandal are mostly accused of paying the consultant, William Singer, either tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to facilitate cheating on admissions tests or to bribe coaches or other officials so that their children could be admitted to schools as recruited athletes.\n\nBut the prosecutors leading the largest-ever college admissions prosecution have also alluded to other families, not named and not charged, who paid far more. One family paid Mr. Singer $6.5 million to get their child into college through the recruitment scheme, the prosecutors have said. Another was described in court documents as having paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million in connection with their daughter\u2019s application to Yale.\n\nProsecutors said that the daughter, whom they called Yale Applicant 1 in court documents, was admitted to Yale as a recruit for the women\u2019s soccer team, despite not being a competitive soccer player. According to documents charging Rudolph Meredith, the former women\u2019s soccer coach at Yale, Mr. Singer had paid Mr. Meredith a bribe to designate the young woman as a recruit for the team. Mr. Singer has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges, and Mr. Meredith has pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges.\n\nOn Friday, Yale Applicant 1 was finally identified: She is Sherry Guo, a young woman from China who moved to Southern California for high school, and who was a freshman at Yale until last month, according to her lawyer, James Spertus.\n\nMs. Guo\u2019s identity was first reported on Friday by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nA spokeswoman for the United States attorney\u2019s office in Boston, Christina Sterling, declined to comment on Ms. Guo\u2019s case. Asked why Ms. Guo and her parents \u2014 as well as the still unidentified family that was said to have paid Mr. Singer $6.5 million \u2014 have not been charged in the case, she said, \u201cI cannot comment other than to say it is an ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nAccording to the charges against Mr. Meredith, Ms. Guo and her family were introduced to Mr. Singer in 2017 by a financial adviser based in Los Angeles. An employee of the financial adviser sent Mr. Singer an email \u201cstating that Yale Applicant 1\u2019s father wished to make a \u2018donation\u2019 to \u2018one of those top schools for his daughter\u2019s \u2018application,\u2019\u201d the charging documents said.\n\nMr. Singer promptly sent Ms. Guo\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and personal statement to Mr. Meredith, the soccer coach, according to the charging documents. Her personal statement contained links to her art portfolio; Mr. Singer told Mr. Meredith he would \u201crevise\u201d the materials to \u201csoccer.\u201d A few days later, he sent Mr. Meredith an athletic profile that falsely described Ms. Guo as the co-captain of a prominent club soccer team in Southern California. Mr. Meredith then designated her as a recruit for the soccer team.\n\nAccording to the charging documents, Mr. Singer mailed Mr. Meredith a check for $400,000 in 2018, and later that year, Ms. Guo\u2019s relatives paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million in several installments, $900,000 of which was sent to a nonprofit foundation Mr. Singer had set up, and which prosecutors argue was used to hide much of Mr. Singer\u2019s and his clients\u2019 illicit activity.\n\nMr. Spertus said that Ms. Guo and her parents did not know that the payment was going toward a bribe. Her parents did not speak English and were not in direct contact with Mr. Singer, he said, while Ms. Guo herself was na\u00efve about how the college admissions process worked in the United States. (Mr. Spertus would not identify Ms. Guo\u2019s parents.)\n\nMs. Guo wanted to go to Columbia University or Oxford, Mr. Spertus said, but Mr. Singer told her to apply to Yale, and that she would be guaranteed to get in. While that might have seemed strange to a student who grew up in the United States, he said, Ms. Guo did not expect to have much choice about where to go to college.\n\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t working with Singer to find the best school for her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is now devastated because she is no longer in college, period.\u201d Yale has said that it rescinded the admission of one student in connection with the case, but has not identified the student.\n\nHe said that Ms. Guo was not copied on either of the emails that Mr. Singer sent to Mr. Meredith suggesting that her college credentials be falsified to say she played soccer.\n\nMr. Spertus said the large size of the payment suggested that Mr. Singer was exploiting Ms. Guo\u2019s family and their lack of knowledge about the college process.\n\n\u201cThe amount alone shows that he was preying on the Chinese community,\u201d he said. \u201cThe donation was made to help underprivileged youth. They were not aware that the money went to Meredith. They did not know that he was going to use that money for a bribe. There is no evidence of that whatsoever.\u201d\n", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/us/college-admissions-scandal.html?searchResultPosition=3", "time": "April 26, 2019"}, {"title": "Students Receive \u2018Target Letters\u2019 in College Admissions Scandal, Lawyer Says", "content": "\nAfter 50 people, including parents and coaches, were charged last month with crimes, the nation\u2019s largest-ever college admissions prosecution appeared to be ensnaring another group \u2014 students.\n\nAccording to a lawyer involved in the case, at least some children of the parents who were charged in the scandal have received so-called target letters, which notify people that they could be targets of a criminal probe. The lawyer declined to be quoted by name, citing sensitivities about the ongoing case. A spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor\u2019s office in Boston, which is handling the case, declined to comment on the development, which was previously reported in Law360, a legal news service, and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIt was uncertain on Monday how many students received such target letters or whether they would, in fact, lead to additional charges. Several defense lawyers in the case said the children of their clients \u2014 parents charged with trying to get their children admitted to college with falsified athletic credentials or altered test scores \u2014 had not received such letters.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said that some of the young people involved in the case were oblivious to what their parents were doing, while others were not. \u201cAt times, the students were in on it,\u201d a federal prosecutor, Eric S. Rosen, said in court last week during one in a long schedule of hearings in the sprawling case.\n\nMore than a dozen parents, including the actress Lori Loughlin, have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them, court documents showed.\n\nMs. Loughlin\u2019s not guilty plea on Monday came a week after 13 other parents, including the actress Felicity Huffman, indicated that they would plead guilty. The decisions by Ms. Loughlin and Ms. Huffman, the most widely known parents involved in the case, were only the latest way in which their legal paths have diverged.\n\nMs. Loughlin waived her right to appear in court for an arraignment after being indicted last week on a count of conspiracy to commit fraud and another of money laundering conspiracy. Her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, also entered a not guilty plea to the same charges, documents showed.\n\nMs. Loughlin and Mr. Giannulli are accused of paying $500,000 in bribes to ensure that their daughters would be admitted to the University of Southern California. The young women were presented as recruits for the women\u2019s crew team, though they did not participate in the sport, according to prosecutors.\n", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/us/lori-loughlin-mossimo-not-guilty.html?searchResultPosition=4", "time": "April 15, 2019"}, {"title": "His Father Paid $400,000 to Get Him Into Georgetown. Now He\u2019s Suing the School.", "content": "\nGeorgetown University said Wednesday that it planned to dismiss two students connected to the college admissions scandal. Just hours earlier, one of those students, Adam Semprevivo, whose father has pleaded guilty in the case, sued Georgetown for threatening to expel him, saying that the university had denied him due process and that it should have been aware of misrepresentations on his application long before the Justice Department announced charges in the nation\u2019s largest college admissions prosecution earlier this year.\n\nGeorgetown did not identify either student, but Mr. Semprevivo\u2019s lawyer, David Kenner, said he had received an email from Georgetown informing him that his admission had been rescinded and that he would be dismissed.\n\nMr. Semprevivo, 21, who is from Los Angeles, just finished his junior year at the college in Washington, D.C. His father, Stephen Semprevivo, pleaded guilty last week to paying a college consultant $400,000 to secure his son\u2019s admission to Georgetown as a recruit to the tennis team, even though the son did not play tennis competitively. According to the lawsuit, Adam has a 3.18 grade point average in college so far. He has not been charged in the case, nor have any other students, though several have received target letters from prosecutors.\n\nMr. Kenner said that dismissal was too harsh a punishment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a life sentence,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s lost three years of his life, studying, getting good grades, doing everything that was expected of him.\u201d He added it could be difficult for Mr. Semprevivo to gain admission to another college and that the dismissal could also affect his job prospects. \u201cPotentially this will follow him for the rest of his life.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit \u2014 which appears to be the first case of a student suing over discipline imposed as a result of the scandal \u2014 underscores the complicated position that universities find themselves in as they try to figure out what action, if any, to take against students connected to the case. Some students appear to have been oblivious to their parents\u2019 illicit efforts to get them into elite colleges, while others were aware, according to documents in the case.\n\nHere are some answers to important questions about the case.\n\nProsecutors say that Georgetown\u2019s former tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, took $2.7 million in bribes from the college counselor at the center of the case, William Singer, between 2012 and 2018. In exchange for the bribes, according to prosecutors, Mr. Ernst designated at least 12 of the children of Mr. Singer\u2019s clients as recruits to the tennis team, ensuring their admission to Georgetown, one of eight colleges \u2014 including Yale, Stanford, and the University of Southern California \u2014 where prosecutors say the scheme played out. Mr. Ernst has been charged with conspiracy to commit racketeering and has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe charging documents specifically mention five parents or sets of parents whose children prosecutors say were designated by Mr. Ernst as recruits to the Georgetown tennis team. In four of those cases, prosecutors say the students\u2019 applications included fabrications about their supposed tennis accomplishments. One student appears to have actually played tennis in high school, but not at Georgetown. Two of the students have already graduated.\n\nMore than a year before federal authorities announced charges in the wide-reaching scandal, Georgetown knew of problems with Mr. Ernst\u2019s recruiting practices.\n\nIn 2017, the admissions office discovered what a spokeswoman called \u201cirregularities in the athletic and other credentials\u201d of two students being recruited by Mr. Ernst to play tennis. The university placed Mr. Ernst on leave and began an internal investigation, which found that he had violated university rules concerning admissions. The university asked him to resign in 2018.\n\nMr. Ernst went on to get a job as the head coach of women\u2019s tennis at the University of Rhode Island. Georgetown has said that it knew nothing about the bribes described by prosecutors and did not find any criminal activity.\n\nGeorgetown gave few details about its investigation of the students. In a statement, a spokeswoman said that, after the charges were brought in the case earlier this year, the university began a review focused on whether any students knowingly provided false information to the university when they applied for admission.\n\n\u201cEach student case was addressed individually and each student was given multiple opportunities to respond and provide information to the University,\u201d the spokeswoman, Meghan Dubyak, said in an email.\n\nMr. Semprevivo\u2019s lawsuit sheds a little more light. It says that Mr. Semprevivo first learned he was being investigated in April, through an email from a university official. It says that he was later sent a letter with a list of 29 questions.\n\nTwo months after charges in the admissions scandal were first announced, some colleges have taken steps to remove students while others appear to be still sorting through what to do. Yale and Stanford have each rescinded the admission of one student. \n\nAt the University of Southern California, roughly two dozen students were being investigated through the student judicial affairs committee. The total number of current students being investigated or who have been investigated at schools around the country is most likely 30 or higher.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why some schools have moved quickly while others have taken more time.\n\nIt is not clear what Adam Semprevivo knew about the admissions scheme, though he did send an email to Mr. Ernst \u2014 drafted by Mr. Singer \u2014 with false statements about his tennis experience, and he received an email from Mr. Singer with an essay intended for his Georgetown application that also contained false statements, according to both the charging documents and the lawsuit. His application to Georgetown also listed other fabricated tennis credentials.\n\nThe lawsuit says that Mr. Singer told Mr. Semprevivo that Mr. Ernst was a friend and would provide a recommendation for him during the admissions process. It also says that Mr. Singer submitted Mr. Semprevivo\u2019s application and typed his name in the signature block. Students are required to sign their applications to affirm that the information in their application is accurate.\n\nMr. Kenner, the lawyer, said that Mr. Singer had worked with Mr. Semprevivo for over a year \u2014 coming to his house every two or three weeks to tutor and advise him \u2014 and gained his trust.\n\n\u201cHe took over the process,\u201d he said of Mr. Singer.\n\nAnother current student whose parents have been charged in the case also seems to have been at least somewhat aware, according to the charging documents. Prosecutors have said that Elizabeth and Manuel Henriquez, a couple from Atherton, Calif., paid Mr. Singer $400,000 to bribe Mr. Ernst to designate their elder daughter, Isabelle, as a recruit to the tennis team. Additionally, according to prosecutors, the Henriquezes paid Mr. Singer at least $50,000 to arrange for cheating on the SAT, ACT and SAT subject tests for Isabelle and her younger sister. The Henriquezes have pleaded not guilty.\n\nLike Adam Semprevivo, Isabelle Henriquez also sent an email to Mr. Ernst that was drafted by Mr. Singer, with fabrications about her tennis experience, according to documents.\n\nProsecutors have said that Ms. Henriquez actively participated in the test cheating scheme. According to the charging documents, Mr. Singer arranged for an SAT expert to proctor her SAT in exchange for a bribe. The proctor, Mark Riddell, who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering and is cooperating with the investigation, told investigators that he had sat next to Ms. Henriquez during the exam and provided her answers, according to the criminal complaint. Afterward, he said, he \u201cgloated\u201d with Ms. Henriquez and her mother \u201cabout the fact that they had cheated and gotten away with it.\u201d\n\nMs. Henriquez and representatives for her parents did not respond to messages asking if her admission had been rescinded.\n\nA handful of children whose parents are accused of bribery have received their degrees. It is unclear how, if at all, schools could discipline those students. While some colleges have revoked degrees in the past for plagiarism, for example, such a move would most likely open up universities to lawsuits, particularly as the students have earned the credits for courses they successfully completed.\n\nMs. Dubyak, the Georgetown spokeswoman, said the university\u2019s review process had focused first on current students, but would still look at students who had graduated.\n", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/us/georgetown-expels-students.html?searchResultPosition=5", "time": "May 15, 2019"}, {"title": "Felicity Huffman and 13 Others to Plead Guilty in College Admissions Scandal", "content": "\nFelicity Huffman, the Hollywood actress, on Monday laid out a list of failings: Yes, she had paid a college counselor $15,000 to arrange for cheating on her daughter\u2019s SAT test. And yes, it had backfired miserably, turning what Ms. Huffman said had been an effort to help her daughter into a betrayal of her.\n\n\u201cI am ashamed,\u201d Ms. Huffman said, announcing that she will plead guilty to a federal crime, part of a sweeping investigation of college admissions fraud unveiled last month by prosecutors in Boston.\n\nIn the statement issued by Ms. Huffman, she said she wanted to apologize to her family, friends and colleagues, and especially, she said, \u201cto the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.\u201d\n\nMs. Huffman was one of 50 people charged in a sweeping investigation of college admissions fraud unveiled last month by federal prosecutors in Boston. On Monday, prosecutors said that 14 people \u2014 13 parents and one coach \u2014 would plead guilty in the case. Dates for the formal pleas in court had yet to be set.\n\nMs. Huffman said that her daughter had been unaware of the cheating \u2014 prosecutors say a proctor corrected her test answers after she had left. And Ms. Huffman acknowledged that, in an attempt to assist her daughter, she had ultimately hurt and betrayed her.\n\n\u201cThis transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life,\u201d she said. \u201cMy desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty.\u201d\n\nThe case prosecutors have laid out centers on a college consultant, William Singer, whom Ms. Huffman and the other parents hired to guide them through the application process. According to prosecutors, Mr. Singer specialized in boosting students\u2019 chances through fraud: He bribed test administrators to allow cheating on college entrance exams and bribed college coaches to designate his clients\u2019 children as recruits to teams for which they were not actually qualified. Mr. Singer cooperated with prosecutors and has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges.\n\nA total of 33 parents were charged in the case. Some have made clear they will fight the charges, while others may still be debating what to do. Ms. Huffman is the highest-profile parent to admit wrongdoing in the case so far.\n\nThe actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, were also charged and were not among those who prosecutors said on Monday would plead guilty. The government has said that the couple conspired with Mr. Singer to pay $500,000 in bribes to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as recruits to the women\u2019s crew team, even though neither actually rowed crew. Ms. Loughlin has lost some professional opportunities as a result of the charges \u2014 most notably, the Hallmark Channel said that it would stop development of shows that feature her.\n\nIt is not clear what impact Ms. Huffman\u2019s acknowledgment of guilt will have on her career. She has roles in several coming movies and television series, including playing the prosecutor Linda Fairstein in the mini-series \u201cWhen They See Us\u201d about the so-called Central Park Five, five black and Hispanic teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of beating and raping a female jogger in Central Park in 1989.\n\nProsecutors said that Ms. Huffman and most of the other parents would plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, but it is unclear how much time, if any, Ms. Huffman and the other parents will receive.\n\nTheir sentences may be affected in part by how much money each is alleged to have paid to Mr. Singer and others as part of the scheme. Ms. Huffman\u2019s payment of $15,000 was among the smallest, according to court documents. Ms. Huffman\u2019s and the 12 other parents\u2019 sentences are also likely to be lighter as a result of their pleading guilty and not making the government go to trial.\n\nIn addition to the parents, prosecutors said on Monday that one of several coaches charged in the case, Michael Center, the former head coach of men\u2019s tennis at the University of Texas at Austin, would also plead guilty to the same crime. Prosecutors said that Mr. Singer paid Mr. Center $60,000 in cash and directed $40,000 to the University of Texas tennis program in exchange for Mr. Center designating the son of one of Mr. Singer\u2019s clients as a recruit for the tennis team, even though he was not a competitive tennis player and did not ultimately play on the team.\n\nTwo parents, Bruce and Davina Isackson of Hillsborough, Calif., have also agreed to cooperate, prosecutors said. The Isacksons were accused of paying Mr. Singer $600,000 to bribe athletics officials in order to secure their two daughters\u2019 admission to U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. as athletic recruits, and to cheat on their younger daughter\u2019s ACT.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint against Ms. Huffman, her husband, William H. Macy, was also involved in the $15,000 payment to Mr. Singer. For reasons that are unclear, Mr. Macy was not charged.\n\nThe number of students who have been punished as a result of the investigation is also growing. Last week, Stanford announced that it had expelled a student who had falsely claimed in her application to be a competitive sailor and had vacated the credits that she had already accumulated. The student\u2019s name has not been made public. The former Stanford sailing coach, John Vandemoer, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering and has acknowledged accepting donations to his sailing program from Mr. Singer in exchange for agreeing to use recruiting slots for Mr. Singer\u2019s clients.\n\nThe student whom Stanford expelled, the daughter of a client of Mr. Singer\u2019s, was not actually recruited as a sailor, but after she was admitted, Mr. Singer directed $500,000 to Stanford\u2019s sailing program.\n", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/us/felicity-huffman-guilty.html?searchResultPosition=6", "time": "April 8, 2019"}]
