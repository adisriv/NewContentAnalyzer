    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "An executive at the investment giant TPG who was charged in a huge college admissions scandal introduced colleagues on the firm’s deal team to the scheme’s ringleader, but nothing came of the business discussions, TPG said on Thursday.\n",
    "\n",
    "TPG also said it planned to strip the executive, William E. McGlashan Jr., of most of the profits he was due from funds he oversaw.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disclosures, in a memorandum to employees, followed an internal investigation into Mr. McGlashan, whom TPG said it had fired last month after he was implicated in the admissions scheme. (Mr. McGlashan has insisted that he resigned before he was fired.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Federal prosecutors have accused Mr. McGlashan, one of TPG’s biggest stars and a powerful Silicon Valley investor, with paying $50,000 to a charity run by the businessman William Singer in exchange for getting his son extra time to complete a college-entrance exam. He is also accused of agreeing to pay $250,000 to ensure his son’s admission to the University of Southern California as a football recruit, although prosecutors have said he did not follow through with that scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lawyers for Mr. McGlashan have indicated that he plans to fight the charges of money laundering and fraud against him. A representative for Mr. McGlashan did not have an immediate comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the memo, TPG, which has more than $103 billion under management, said Mr. McGlashan had met with Mr. Singer in early 2017, and then introduced him to colleagues to discuss potential business ideas. The introduction was made before the admissions fraud that federal prosecutors say Mr. McGlashan participated in, according to the firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TPG deal team quickly decided against working with Mr. Singer, the memo said. Two other TPG employees did hire Mr. Singer, but for what the firm described as legitimate college-counseling services.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We are confident that the process and deal team worked as they should, free from any undue influence by Mr. McGlashan or knowledge of unethical or criminal behavior in Mr. Singer’s businesses,” a TPG spokesman said in a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "TPG also said in the memo that it had determined the financial terms of Mr. McGlashan’s severance based on the documents governing its funds. He will lose all profits he would be owed from the firm’s Growth and Rise funds — potentially millions of dollars — but will retain any stake in the firm itself that had already vested. The Growth fund has invested in technology darlings like Uber.\n",

    "article['title'] = \"A Mystery Solved in the College Admissions Scandal: The Family Who Paid $1.2 Million\"\n",
    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "One of the mysteries of the sweeping college admissions fraud case has been over the families that prosecutors say paid the biggest sums to a college consultant at the center of the schemes but that have not been charged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 33 parents charged in the scandal are mostly accused of paying the consultant, William Singer, either tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to facilitate cheating on admissions tests or to bribe coaches or other officials so that their children could be admitted to schools as recruited athletes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the prosecutors leading the largest-ever college admissions prosecution have also alluded to other families, not named and not charged, who paid far more. One family paid Mr. Singer $6.5 million to get their child into college through the recruitment scheme, the prosecutors have said. Another was described in court documents as having paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million in connection with their daughter’s application to Yale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors said that the daughter, whom they called Yale Applicant 1 in court documents, was admitted to Yale as a recruit for the women’s soccer team, despite not being a competitive soccer player. According to documents charging Rudolph Meredith, the former women’s soccer coach at Yale, Mr. Singer had paid Mr. Meredith a bribe to designate the young woman as a recruit for the team. Mr. Singer has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges, and Mr. Meredith has pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Friday, Yale Applicant 1 was finally identified: She is Sherry Guo, a young woman from China who moved to Southern California for high school, and who was a freshman at Yale until last month, according to her lawyer, James Spertus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Guo’s identity was first reported on Friday by The Wall Street Journal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A spokeswoman for the United States attorney’s office in Boston, Christina Sterling, declined to comment on Ms. Guo’s case. Asked why Ms. Guo and her parents — as well as the still unidentified family that was said to have paid Mr. Singer $6.5 million — have not been charged in the case, she said, “I cannot comment other than to say it is an ongoing investigation.”\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the charges against Mr. Meredith, Ms. Guo and her family were introduced to Mr. Singer in 2017 by a financial adviser based in Los Angeles. An employee of the financial adviser sent Mr. Singer an email “stating that Yale Applicant 1’s father wished to make a ‘donation’ to ‘one of those top schools for his daughter’s ‘application,’” the charging documents said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer promptly sent Ms. Guo’s résumé and personal statement to Mr. Meredith, the soccer coach, according to the charging documents. Her personal statement contained links to her art portfolio; Mr. Singer told Mr. Meredith he would “revise” the materials to “soccer.” A few days later, he sent Mr. Meredith an athletic profile that falsely described Ms. Guo as the co-captain of a prominent club soccer team in Southern California. Mr. Meredith then designated her as a recruit for the soccer team.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the charging documents, Mr. Singer mailed Mr. Meredith a check for $400,000 in 2018, and later that year, Ms. Guo’s relatives paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million in several installments, $900,000 of which was sent to a nonprofit foundation Mr. Singer had set up, and which prosecutors argue was used to hide much of Mr. Singer’s and his clients’ illicit activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Spertus said that Ms. Guo and her parents did not know that the payment was going toward a bribe. Her parents did not speak English and were not in direct contact with Mr. Singer, he said, while Ms. Guo herself was naïve about how the college admissions process worked in the United States. (Mr. Spertus would not identify Ms. Guo’s parents.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Guo wanted to go to Columbia University or Oxford, Mr. Spertus said, but Mr. Singer told her to apply to Yale, and that she would be guaranteed to get in. While that might have seemed strange to a student who grew up in the United States, he said, Ms. Guo did not expect to have much choice about where to go to college.\n",
    "\n",
    "“She wasn’t working with Singer to find the best school for her,” he said. “She is now devastated because she is no longer in college, period.” Yale has said that it rescinded the admission of one student in connection with the case, but has not identified the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "He said that Ms. Guo was not copied on either of the emails that Mr. Singer sent to Mr. Meredith suggesting that her college credentials be falsified to say she played soccer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Spertus said the large size of the payment suggested that Mr. Singer was exploiting Ms. Guo’s family and their lack of knowledge about the college process.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The amount alone shows that he was preying on the Chinese community,” he said. “The donation was made to help underprivileged youth. They were not aware that the money went to Meredith. They did not know that he was going to use that money for a bribe. There is no evidence of that whatsoever.”\n",

    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "After 50 people, including parents and coaches, were charged last month with crimes, the nation’s largest-ever college admissions prosecution appeared to be ensnaring another group — students.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a lawyer involved in the case, at least some children of the parents who were charged in the scandal have received so-called target letters, which notify people that they could be targets of a criminal probe. The lawyer declined to be quoted by name, citing sensitivities about the ongoing case. A spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor’s office in Boston, which is handling the case, declined to comment on the development, which was previously reported in Law360, a legal news service, and The Wall Street Journal.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was uncertain on Monday how many students received such target letters or whether they would, in fact, lead to additional charges. Several defense lawyers in the case said the children of their clients — parents charged with trying to get their children admitted to college with falsified athletic credentials or altered test scores — had not received such letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Federal prosecutors have said that some of the young people involved in the case were oblivious to what their parents were doing, while others were not. “At times, the students were in on it,” a federal prosecutor, Eric S. Rosen, said in court last week during one in a long schedule of hearings in the sprawling case.\n",
    "\n",
    "More than a dozen parents, including the actress Lori Loughlin, have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them, court documents showed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Loughlin’s not guilty plea on Monday came a week after 13 other parents, including the actress Felicity Huffman, indicated that they would plead guilty. The decisions by Ms. Loughlin and Ms. Huffman, the most widely known parents involved in the case, were only the latest way in which their legal paths have diverged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Loughlin waived her right to appear in court for an arraignment after being indicted last week on a count of conspiracy to commit fraud and another of money laundering conspiracy. Her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, also entered a not guilty plea to the same charges, documents showed.\n",
    "\n",

    "article['title'] = \"His Father Paid $400,000 to Get Him Into Georgetown. Now He’s Suing the School.\"\n",
    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "Georgetown University said Wednesday that it planned to dismiss two students connected to the college admissions scandal. Just hours earlier, one of those students, Adam Semprevivo, whose father has pleaded guilty in the case, sued Georgetown for threatening to expel him, saying that the university had denied him due process and that it should have been aware of misrepresentations on his application long before the Justice Department announced charges in the nation’s largest college admissions prosecution earlier this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Georgetown did not identify either student, but Mr. Semprevivo’s lawyer, David Kenner, said he had received an email from Georgetown informing him that his admission had been rescinded and that he would be dismissed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Semprevivo, 21, who is from Los Angeles, just finished his junior year at the college in Washington, D.C. His father, Stephen Semprevivo, pleaded guilty last week to paying a college consultant $400,000 to secure his son’s admission to Georgetown as a recruit to the tennis team, even though the son did not play tennis competitively. According to the lawsuit, Adam has a 3.18 grade point average in college so far. He has not been charged in the case, nor have any other students, though several have received target letters from prosecutors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Kenner said that dismissal was too harsh a punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It’s a life sentence,” he said. “He’s lost three years of his life, studying, getting good grades, doing everything that was expected of him.” He added it could be difficult for Mr. Semprevivo to gain admission to another college and that the dismissal could also affect his job prospects. “Potentially this will follow him for the rest of his life.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The lawsuit — which appears to be the first case of a student suing over discipline imposed as a result of the scandal — underscores the complicated position that universities find themselves in as they try to figure out what action, if any, to take against students connected to the case. Some students appear to have been oblivious to their parents’ illicit efforts to get them into elite colleges, while others were aware, according to documents in the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some answers to important questions about the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors say that Georgetown’s former tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, took $2.7 million in bribes from the college counselor at the center of the case, William Singer, between 2012 and 2018. In exchange for the bribes, according to prosecutors, Mr. Ernst designated at least 12 of the children of Mr. Singer’s clients as recruits to the tennis team, ensuring their admission to Georgetown, one of eight colleges — including Yale, Stanford, and the University of Southern California — where prosecutors say the scheme played out. Mr. Ernst has been charged with conspiracy to commit racketeering and has pleaded not guilty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The charging documents specifically mention five parents or sets of parents whose children prosecutors say were designated by Mr. Ernst as recruits to the Georgetown tennis team. In four of those cases, prosecutors say the students’ applications included fabrications about their supposed tennis accomplishments. One student appears to have actually played tennis in high school, but not at Georgetown. Two of the students have already graduated.\n",
    "\n",
    "More than a year before federal authorities announced charges in the wide-reaching scandal, Georgetown knew of problems with Mr. Ernst’s recruiting practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017, the admissions office discovered what a spokeswoman called “irregularities in the athletic and other credentials” of two students being recruited by Mr. Ernst to play tennis. The university placed Mr. Ernst on leave and began an internal investigation, which found that he had violated university rules concerning admissions. The university asked him to resign in 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Ernst went on to get a job as the head coach of women’s tennis at the University of Rhode Island. Georgetown has said that it knew nothing about the bribes described by prosecutors and did not find any criminal activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Georgetown gave few details about its investigation of the students. In a statement, a spokeswoman said that, after the charges were brought in the case earlier this year, the university began a review focused on whether any students knowingly provided false information to the university when they applied for admission.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Each student case was addressed individually and each student was given multiple opportunities to respond and provide information to the University,” the spokeswoman, Meghan Dubyak, said in an email.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Semprevivo’s lawsuit sheds a little more light. It says that Mr. Semprevivo first learned he was being investigated in April, through an email from a university official. It says that he was later sent a letter with a list of 29 questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two months after charges in the admissions scandal were first announced, some colleges have taken steps to remove students while others appear to be still sorting through what to do. Yale and Stanford have each rescinded the admission of one student. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the University of Southern California, roughly two dozen students were being investigated through the student judicial affairs committee. The total number of current students being investigated or who have been investigated at schools around the country is most likely 30 or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was not immediately clear why some schools have moved quickly while others have taken more time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not clear what Adam Semprevivo knew about the admissions scheme, though he did send an email to Mr. Ernst — drafted by Mr. Singer — with false statements about his tennis experience, and he received an email from Mr. Singer with an essay intended for his Georgetown application that also contained false statements, according to both the charging documents and the lawsuit. His application to Georgetown also listed other fabricated tennis credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lawsuit says that Mr. Singer told Mr. Semprevivo that Mr. Ernst was a friend and would provide a recommendation for him during the admissions process. It also says that Mr. Singer submitted Mr. Semprevivo’s application and typed his name in the signature block. Students are required to sign their applications to affirm that the information in their application is accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Kenner, the lawyer, said that Mr. Singer had worked with Mr. Semprevivo for over a year — coming to his house every two or three weeks to tutor and advise him — and gained his trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "“He took over the process,” he said of Mr. Singer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another current student whose parents have been charged in the case also seems to have been at least somewhat aware, according to the charging documents. Prosecutors have said that Elizabeth and Manuel Henriquez, a couple from Atherton, Calif., paid Mr. Singer $400,000 to bribe Mr. Ernst to designate their elder daughter, Isabelle, as a recruit to the tennis team. Additionally, according to prosecutors, the Henriquezes paid Mr. Singer at least $50,000 to arrange for cheating on the SAT, ACT and SAT subject tests for Isabelle and her younger sister. The Henriquezes have pleaded not guilty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Adam Semprevivo, Isabelle Henriquez also sent an email to Mr. Ernst that was drafted by Mr. Singer, with fabrications about her tennis experience, according to documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors have said that Ms. Henriquez actively participated in the test cheating scheme. According to the charging documents, Mr. Singer arranged for an SAT expert to proctor her SAT in exchange for a bribe. The proctor, Mark Riddell, who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering and is cooperating with the investigation, told investigators that he had sat next to Ms. Henriquez during the exam and provided her answers, according to the criminal complaint. Afterward, he said, he “gloated” with Ms. Henriquez and her mother “about the fact that they had cheated and gotten away with it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Henriquez and representatives for her parents did not respond to messages asking if her admission had been rescinded.\n",
    "\n",
    "A handful of children whose parents are accused of bribery have received their degrees. It is unclear how, if at all, schools could discipline those students. While some colleges have revoked degrees in the past for plagiarism, for example, such a move would most likely open up universities to lawsuits, particularly as the students have earned the credits for courses they successfully completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Dubyak, the Georgetown spokeswoman, said the university’s review process had focused first on current students, but would still look at students who had graduated.\n",

    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "Felicity Huffman, the Hollywood actress, on Monday laid out a list of failings: Yes, she had paid a college counselor $15,000 to arrange for cheating on her daughter’s SAT test. And yes, it had backfired miserably, turning what Ms. Huffman said had been an effort to help her daughter into a betrayal of her.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am ashamed,” Ms. Huffman said, announcing that she will plead guilty to a federal crime, part of a sweeping investigation of college admissions fraud unveiled last month by prosecutors in Boston.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the statement issued by Ms. Huffman, she said she wanted to apologize to her family, friends and colleagues, and especially, she said, “to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Huffman was one of 50 people charged in a sweeping investigation of college admissions fraud unveiled last month by federal prosecutors in Boston. On Monday, prosecutors said that 14 people — 13 parents and one coach — would plead guilty in the case. Dates for the formal pleas in court had yet to be set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Huffman said that her daughter had been unaware of the cheating — prosecutors say a proctor corrected her test answers after she had left. And Ms. Huffman acknowledged that, in an attempt to assist her daughter, she had ultimately hurt and betrayed her.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life,” she said. “My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The case prosecutors have laid out centers on a college consultant, William Singer, whom Ms. Huffman and the other parents hired to guide them through the application process. According to prosecutors, Mr. Singer specialized in boosting students’ chances through fraud: He bribed test administrators to allow cheating on college entrance exams and bribed college coaches to designate his clients’ children as recruits to teams for which they were not actually qualified. Mr. Singer cooperated with prosecutors and has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "A total of 33 parents were charged in the case. Some have made clear they will fight the charges, while others may still be debating what to do. Ms. Huffman is the highest-profile parent to admit wrongdoing in the case so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, were also charged and were not among those who prosecutors said on Monday would plead guilty. The government has said that the couple conspired with Mr. Singer to pay $500,000 in bribes to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as recruits to the women’s crew team, even though neither actually rowed crew. Ms. Loughlin has lost some professional opportunities as a result of the charges — most notably, the Hallmark Channel said that it would stop development of shows that feature her.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not clear what impact Ms. Huffman’s acknowledgment of guilt will have on her career. She has roles in several coming movies and television series, including playing the prosecutor Linda Fairstein in the mini-series “When They See Us” about the so-called Central Park Five, five black and Hispanic teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of beating and raping a female jogger in Central Park in 1989.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors said that Ms. Huffman and most of the other parents would plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, but it is unclear how much time, if any, Ms. Huffman and the other parents will receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their sentences may be affected in part by how much money each is alleged to have paid to Mr. Singer and others as part of the scheme. Ms. Huffman’s payment of $15,000 was among the smallest, according to court documents. Ms. Huffman’s and the 12 other parents’ sentences are also likely to be lighter as a result of their pleading guilty and not making the government go to trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the parents, prosecutors said on Monday that one of several coaches charged in the case, Michael Center, the former head coach of men’s tennis at the University of Texas at Austin, would also plead guilty to the same crime. Prosecutors said that Mr. Singer paid Mr. Center $60,000 in cash and directed $40,000 to the University of Texas tennis program in exchange for Mr. Center designating the son of one of Mr. Singer’s clients as a recruit for the tennis team, even though he was not a competitive tennis player and did not ultimately play on the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two parents, Bruce and Davina Isackson of Hillsborough, Calif., have also agreed to cooperate, prosecutors said. The Isacksons were accused of paying Mr. Singer $600,000 to bribe athletics officials in order to secure their two daughters’ admission to U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. as athletic recruits, and to cheat on their younger daughter’s ACT.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the criminal complaint against Ms. Huffman, her husband, William H. Macy, was also involved in the $15,000 payment to Mr. Singer. For reasons that are unclear, Mr. Macy was not charged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of students who have been punished as a result of the investigation is also growing. Last week, Stanford announced that it had expelled a student who had falsely claimed in her application to be a competitive sailor and had vacated the credits that she had already accumulated. The student’s name has not been made public. The former Stanford sailing coach, John Vandemoer, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering and has acknowledged accepting donations to his sailing program from Mr. Singer in exchange for agreeing to use recruiting slots for Mr. Singer’s clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The student whom Stanford expelled, the daughter of a client of Mr. Singer’s, was not actually recruited as a sailor, but after she was admitted, Mr. Singer directed $500,000 to Stanford’s sailing program.\n",

      "Federal prosecutors have accused Mr. McGlashan, one of TPG’s biggest stars and a powerful Silicon Valley investor, with paying $50,000 to a charity run by the businessman William Singer in exchange for getting his son extra time to complete a college-entrance exam. He is also accused of agreeing to pay $250,000 to ensure his son’s admission to the University of Southern California as a football recruit, although prosecutors have said he did not follow through with that scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lawyers for Mr. McGlashan have indicated that he plans to fight the charges of money laundering and fraud against him. A representative for Mr. McGlashan did not have an immediate comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the memo, TPG, which has more than $103 billion under management, said Mr. McGlashan had met with Mr. Singer in early 2017, and then introduced him to colleagues to discuss potential business ideas. The introduction was made before the admissions fraud that federal prosecutors say Mr. McGlashan participated in, according to the firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The TPG deal team quickly decided against working with Mr. Singer, the memo said. Two other TPG employees did hire Mr. Singer, but for what the firm described as legitimate college-counseling services.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are confident that the process and deal team worked as they should, free from any undue influence by Mr. McGlashan or knowledge of unethical or criminal behavior in Mr. Singer’s businesses,” a TPG spokesman said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "TPG also said in the memo that it had determined the financial terms of Mr. McGlashan’s severance based on the documents governing its funds. He will lose all profits he would be owed from the firm’s Growth and Rise funds — potentially millions of dollars — but will retain any stake in the firm itself that had already vested. The Growth fund has invested in technology darlings like Uber.\n",
