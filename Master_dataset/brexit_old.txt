[{"body": "LONDON \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain on Tuesday dangled before lawmakers the prospect of a second referendum on Brexit, in a last-ditch effort to win over those who have rejected her three previous efforts to extract Britain from the European Union.\n\nIn a speech in London, Mrs. May outlined what she called a \u201cnew Brexit deal,\u201d which would give Parliament a broader role in shaping her Brexit plan. But most attention focused on her offer to have lawmakers vote on whether to have a second referendum, something she had previously ruled out.\n\nMrs. May described the deal as \u201cone last chance\u201d to deliver on the 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union.\n\nIf lawmakers reject it again, she said, \u201cthey are voting to stop Brexit.\u201d She added, \u201cIf they do so, the consequences could hardly be greater.\u201d\n\nEarly reaction among Conservatives and Labour was not encouraging.\n\nThe Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said his party would not support the plan, calling it a \u201crehash of what was discussed before.\u201d Pro-Brexit Conservatives reacted angrily as well, with Jacob Rees-Mogg, a lawmaker and leader of that faction, dismissing it as \u201cworse than before.\u201d\n\nOn the referendum, it was unclear how much of a concession Mrs. May was making. That is because she was offering lawmakers a chance to vote on whether to have a referendum, rather than supporting one herself. And she was vague about what question or questions any referendum would pose.\n\nHer new deal seemed designed to entice pro-Brexit Labour Party lawmakers to support her Brexit blueprint. It includes the opportunity for Parliament to decide on whether to keep a type of customs union with Brussels, eliminating tariffs and reducing checks on goods at frontiers \u2014 a demand of Mr. Corbyn.\n\nBut in moving somewhat closer to Labour\u2019s position, she risked losing Conservative supporters of her plan.\n\nNor was she guaranteeing any new consensus on sensitive issues. Parliament has previously voted against a second referendum, and Mrs. May said she still opposed the idea, making it unlikely there would be sufficient support for it this time. Nor has Parliament yet managed to coalesce around any plan to stay in a customs union with the bloc.\n\nThe vote on legislation to leave the bloc, known as the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, is scheduled for the week beginning June 3. It is likely to be the final significant act of Mrs. May\u2019s tenure, as she has promised to set a date for her departure after the decision, ending almost three troubled years in power.\n\nMrs. May\u2019s latest Brexit deal differs from her previous one in that it offers Labour lawmakers more assurances on European standards on workplace protections and environmental rights.\n\nShe would also allow Parliament the right to demand, at least temporarily, a type of customs union with the bloc that is designed to prevent tariffs and many border checks on industrial goods, but only until the next general election, scheduled for 2022. And she is also offering the opportunity to vote on the second referendum.\n\nFor Conservative Brexit supporters the bill has some sweeteners in that it commits the government to working on technical measures to track goods that would prevent the need for border checks at the Irish border.\n\nCritically, however, this would not guarantee Britain staying out of the so-called Irish backstop, a device to avoid a hard border with Ireland. The backstop would keep the whole of the United Kingdom tied to Europe\u2019s customs rules indefinitely, outraging Brexit supporters who say it defeats the whole purpose of Brexit.\n\nOn Tuesday there was a backlash from hard-line pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers, including Iain Duncan Smith, a former party leader.\n\n\u201cThe backstop is still there, it\u2019s a customs union in all but name and it puts Brussels firmly in control of our destiny,\u201d he said in a statement, adding that there was \u201cnothing new or bold about this bad buffet of non-Brexit options,\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday Mrs. May at least secured support from her fractured cabinet for her plan, no mean feat in itself. Yet, in Parliament, the math does not appear to have changed for Mrs. May \u2014 at least not for the better.\n\nHer Conservatives are braced for a humiliating defeat in European elections this week, confronted by the challenge of the Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage, who wants Britain to leave the European Union fast, without any deal if necessary.\n\nSeveral of those vying to succeed Mrs. May are already arguing the same hard Brexit line. As a result, several hard-line pro-Brexit supporters within Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party, who reluctantly supported the last of her three efforts to get the plan through Parliament, are indicating they will revert to their earlier hostility.\n\nMark Francois, a prominent member of the hard-line Brexit faction told the BBC that the opposition to Mrs. May\u2019s deal was \u201cgoing up, not down.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless she is rescued by a Marxist,\u201d said Mr. Francois, referring to Mr. Corbyn, \u201cthe Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead on arrival.\u201d", "date": "2019-05-21", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/world/europe/theresa-may-referendum-brexit.html", "title": "Theresa May\u2019s New Brexit Bid: A Second Referendum", "authors": [], "dataType": "news", "dateTime": null, "eventUri": null, "image": null, "idDuplicate": false, "lang": "eng", "sentiment": null, "sim": null, "source": null, "time": null, "uri": null, "wgt": null}, {"body": "Mrs. May is leaving Downing Street, but not today.\n\nFacing a cabinet rebellion, Theresa May set out Friday morning a timetable for her departure from office.\n\nStanding in front of 10 Downing Street, Mrs. May said it was in the \u201cbest interests of the country for a new prime minister\u201d to lead Britain through the Brexit process. She announced plans to step down as the leader of the Conservative Party on June 7, with the process to replace her beginning the following week. She will remain as a lame-duck prime minister until a new leader is chosen, probably by the end of July.\n\n\u201cI feel as certain today as I did three years ago that in a democracy, if you give people a choice you have a duty to implement what they decide. I have done my best to do that,\u201d she added. \u201cI have done everything I can to convince M.P.s to back that deal. Sadly, I have not been able to do so.\u201d\n\nMrs. May\u2019s voice cracked as she said she was honored to serve the country as the \u201csecond female prime minister, but certainly not the last,\u201d and said the role had been the honor of her life.\n\nThe speech followed a meeting with Graham Brady, a powerful leader of backbench Conservative lawmakers.\n\nShe will continue as a member of Parliament after stepping down as prime minister, the Press Association news agency has reported.\n\nIn Brussels, the Brexit equation is unchanged.\n\nEuropean Union officials worry about what comes next, but they insisted that their position on Brexit would not budge. The bloc\u2019s leaders did not want Britain to leave, but they remain committed to the withdrawal agreement Mrs. May negotiated, even if the next prime minister is a hard-line Brexiteer who tries to drive a harder bargain.\n\n\u201cWe are ready, we have been ready, we continue to be ready whatever the scenario is,\u201d said Mina Andreeva, a European Commission spokeswoman. But, she added, the commission would prefer \u201can orderly withdrawal on the basis of the withdrawal agreement that has been negotiated with the U.K.\u201d\n\nThe view from Brussels is that the choices remain the negotiated deal, an economically damaging \u201ccliff edge\u201d Brexit without a deal, or no Brexit at all.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Spanish government called Mrs. May\u2019s resignation \u201cbad news\u201d because it makes a no-deal Brexit more likely.\n\nIn Paris, the German ambassador to France, Nikolaus Meyer-Landrut, speaking at an event hosted by the American University of Paris, noted the resignation of Mrs. May and said that Germany was always willing to give the British more time to sort out the Brexit impasse.\n\nBut even with Mrs. May\u2019s resignation, he said, Brexit and its dilemmas remained. \u201cBrexit yes or no,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBut more important is, Brexit how? Every how has a price. And the British begin to understand how high is the price.\u201d\nSign up for The Interpreter\nSubscribe for original insights, commentary and discussions on the major news stories of the week, from columnists Max Fisher and Amanda Taub.\n\nThe succession race is well underway.\n\nConservative lawmakers have been positioning themselves for a leadership contest for months. Several were already campaigning actively before Mrs. May announced her decision to resign.\n\nCandidates for party leadership have to be nominated by two other members of Parliament, though if there is only one candidate, he or she automatically becomes the new leader. If more than two candidates emerge, lawmakers vote among themselves to narrow the field and then put two candidates to a vote by all Conservative Party members, who number approximately 120,000.\n\nThe Conservative Party chairman, Brandon Lewis, said in a statement on Friday that lawmakers would begin their voting process on June 10, and that the new leader would be in place before Parliament\u2019s summer break, which usually begins in late July.\n\nHard-line Brexit supporters will be determined to replace Mrs. May with someone from their ranks. The former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson; the former Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab; and Andrea Leadsom, who left her cabinet post as leader of the House of Commons on Wednesday, are seen as likely contenders.\n\nBut less ideological figures are likely to put themselves forward, too, including Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, and Sajid Javid, the home secretary.\n\nThe departure process starts after Trump\u2019s June visit ends.\n\nConservative lawmakers have been deeply frustrated by Mrs. May\u2019s failure to deliver on Brexit, which became the government\u2019s central \u2014 some would say its sole \u2014 preoccupation after the country voted to leave the union in a 2016 referendum.\n\nBut the breaking point has come at an awkward moment, with President Trump scheduled to arrive in Britain on June 3 for a state visit and to take part in events to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings that preceded the end of World War II.\n\nMr. Trump and Mrs. May are to meet at 10 Downing Street on June 4, according to a schedule released by Buckingham Palace. Mr. Trump is also to attend a state banquet at Buckingham Palace, hosted by the queen.\n\nMrs. May\u2019s ability to soak up political punishment and plow on regardless won her admiration, even from some of her many critics. But the pressure on her increased after disastrous local election results this month, when the Conservatives lost more than 1,300 seats in municipalities around the country.\n\nThen, the government announced that Britain would, after all, take part in elections to the European Parliament this week \u2014 another symbol of Mrs. May\u2019s failure to achieve a withdrawal. Britons voted on Thursday, but the results will be announced on Sunday, after all the European Union countries have gone to the polls. They are expected to be catastrophic for the Conservatives.\n\nMrs. May\u2019s speech upset immigration advocates and firefighters.\n\nEven in her departure speech, Mrs. May drew ire from some in the country who saw her language as insulting.\n\nFirst, she quoted Sir Nicholas Winton, who orchestrated the rescue of hundreds of children from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in an effort known as Kindertransport, and was a constituent of hers in the final years of his life.\n\nShe recalled that he had pulled her aside at a local event and extolled the value of compromise, advice she said she worried lawmakers had forgotten. Some analysts hailed the line as a powerful, if belated, pitch for an elusive compromise.\n\nBut immigration advocates saw that as a shameless attempt to use Mr. Winton\u2019s legacy by a prime minister who had made anti-migrant policies a centerpiece of her political career.\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\n\u201cTheresa May did everything in her power to keep vulnerable refugees out of the U.K. and introduced the hostile environment. Makes me livid,\u201d Colin Yeo, an immigration lawyer, wrote on Twitter.\n\nMrs. May was previously Britain\u2019s home secretary, and implemented a \u201chostile environment\u201d policy that obliged businesses and private landlords, as well as public officials, to check the immigration papers of job applicants, renters, medical patients, banking customers and more. It gave rise to the Windrush scandal, in which people from Caribbean countries were wrongly denied rights or deported from Britain.\n\nThen, Mrs. May pointed to her government\u2019s response to the Grenfell fire disaster that left some 72 people dead as a proud part of her legacy. The Fire Brigades Union issued a statement that called Mrs. May\u2019s comment \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of the underlying issues at Grenfell were due to unsafe conditions that had been allowed to fester under Tory governments and a council for which Theresa May bears ultimate responsibility,\u201d the statement read.\n\nBritish business is preparing for more uncertainty.\n\nBritain has taken several economic hits recently, and business leaders are worried about the prospect of more gridlock in Parliament, potentially leading to a harmful \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cThere are only five months before Britain crashes out of the E.U. without a deal, causing prices to rise and reducing the availability of many goods on the shelves,\u201d Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said in a statement.\n\nDespite such concerns, British stocks rose slightly on Thursday.\n\nA number of businesses, wary of Brexit and the uncertainty surrounding it, have already moved some operations out of Britain.\n\nBritish Steel, the country\u2019s second-biggest steel company, collapsed into insolvency this week and said Brexit was partly to blame. The travel company Thomas Cook reported massive losses, saying Brexit had held travelers back from booking trips.\n\nFor months, retailers stockpiled goods ahead of previous Brexit deadlines for fear that traffic jams and issues at the border would prevent food from getting into the country. Britain imports about half its food from or via the European Union.\n\nMrs. May\u2019s fall echoed another leader\u2019s, complete with sexist overtones.\n\nThroughout Mrs. May\u2019s protracted fall, Conservative lawmakers were eager to avoid being seen as the proverbial \u201cmen in gray suits\u201d ushering out Britain\u2019s second female prime minister, even as they worked hard behind the scenes to do just that.\n\nThe party suffered after being seen to humiliate Margaret Thatcher, Britain\u2019s first female prime minister, when she was forced out in 1990. But in the days before Mrs. May announced her resignation plans, the echoes were hard to avoid.\n\nLawmakers raised the prospect of Mrs. May\u2019s husband, Philip, intervening, much as Ms. Thatcher\u2019s husband, Denis, was famously said to have urged her to stand down.\n\nIain Duncan Smith, a prominent Brexiteer and former Conservative party leader, said in a radio interview about Mrs. May: \u201cThe only person closest to her is clearly her husband, and I think somebody has to say, \u2018Look, nobody likes this.\u2019\u201d\n\nA British tabloid, Metro, played up those appeals with the headline, \u201cJust Tell Her Phil.\u201d\n\nTributes flowed from those who tried to oust her.  \n\nIt has been a long time since so many prominent political figures had nice things to say about Mrs. May.\n\nCompliments poured in from opposition lawmakers who have tried to oust her, and from fellow Conservatives who have undermined her and hope to take her place. Some were backhanded, some barbed, and still others gave no hint of the history of animosity behind them.\n\n\u201cThank you for your stoical service to our country and the Conservative Party,\u201d tweeted Mr. Johnson, who quit Mrs. May\u2019s cabinet over Brexit and who has never concealed his ambition to be prime minister.\n\nNicola Sturgeon, first minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party, retweeted Mr. Johnson with the comment, \u201cWhat a hypocrite.\u201d\n\nTwo other Conservatives who quit Mrs. May\u2019s cabinet over Brexit and would like to take her place, Mr. Raab and Ms. Leadsom, described her statement as \u201cdignified.\u201d\n\nThe statement from Tom Watson, deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party, was no bouquet, saying that Mrs. May \u201chad an unenviably difficult job, and she did it badly.\u201d But even he added, \u201cshe tried to do what was right for our country,\u201d and was \u201chonorable in her intentions.\u201d\n\nJeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, dispensed with any pretense of a tribute. \u201cShe\u2019s now accepted what the country\u2019s known for months: She can\u2019t govern, and nor can her divided and disintegrating party.\u201d\n\nBut few politicians could put themselves in her place as completely as her immediate predecessor, David Cameron, whose own six-year premiership was torpedoed three years ago \u2014 also by Brexit.\n\n\u201cI know what it feels like when you come to realize your leadership time has finished, that the country needs a new leader, and it\u2019s extremely difficult and painful to step outside Downing Street and say those things,\u201d he told reporters on Friday, standing on a picturesque country road, amid waving grasses.\n\nOne could also argue that Mr. Cameron left the problem in her lap: He is the one who promised to hold the Brexit referendum, a monumental gamble he made to placate the Euroskeptic wing of his party.\n", "date": "2019-05-24", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/world/europe/theresa-may-resignation.html", "title": "Theresa May to Resign as U.K. Prime Minister", "authors": [], "dataType": "news", "dateTime": null, "eventUri": null, "image": null, "idDuplicate": false, "lang": "eng", "sentiment": null, "sim": null, "source": null, "time": null, "uri": null, "wgt": null}, {"uri": "1144055368", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "23:36:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T23:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/yes-europes-far-right-is-gaining-strength-but-so-is-the-resistance/2019/05/23/d185105a-7d85-11e9-8bb7-0fc796cf2ec0_story.html", "title": "Opinion | Yes, Europe's far right is gaining strength. But so is the resistance.", "body": "By Anne Applebaum Anne Applebaum Columnist focusing on national politics and foreign policy Columnist May 23 at 6:49 PM\n\nI've written a lot, it's true, about the new far-right parties in Europe in recent months, including their use of the Internet to amplify anger, the conspiracy theories they rely upon and their Russian connections -- all of which helps to explain why they may score a big victory in this week's European parliamentary elections. But it's worth remembering that there is another side to this story. The politics of President Trump and Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, and the disaster of Brexit, have also produced a backlash: Pro-European politicians, highly conscious of past mistakes, are also gaining in strength. And they are thinking hard about what to do next.\n\nOn Tuesday, I met one of the leaders of this backlash: Emmanuel Macron, who himself founded an anti-establishment movement on his way to becoming president of France. The occasion was a lunch, organized by French philosopher Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy, for a group of European writers, historians and philosophers. This was a private lunch, not an interview, so I won't quote anyone directly. But the conversation followed a pattern now familiar from Macron's extensive public meetings.\n\nNotably, the French president lets everyone talk. He listens. He takes notes. He nods to his aides when he hears something he thinks especially important, so that they take notes, too. And what seemed to interest him most was the anxiety he heard -- about Europe, about the return of familiar kinds of xenophobia, about democracy itself. In response, he offered some context, pointing out that the fears of intellectuals are not necessarily shared by voters, and that the failures of economic liberalism have now helped to discredit political liberalism, too.\n\nHe also pointed out, as he has done elsewhere, that those who fear the return of nationalism and nativism across the continent still don't have a common political language. They are the majority -- in most countries, the vast majority. But they are also center-right conservatives, center-left social democrats and liberals from many countries, and they don't necessarily use the same political vocabulary. They lack a common set of heroes, a common set of themes -- in other words, to use the now unavoidable phrase, they lack a common narrative. Inexcusably, they have in some cases let people like Heinz-Christian Strache, the Austrian far-right leader who resigned after he was caught on video offering contracts and business favors to a woman he thought was a wealthy Russian, claim to speak for \"patriotism\" and \"European civilization,\" when in reality they stand for corruption and an end to political debate.\n\nThe only real solutions to this problem are long-term. In the past, Macron has talked of creating networks of European universities, schools and cultural institutions to ensure that \"every European recognizes their destiny in the figures adorning a Greek temple or in Mona Lisa's smile,\" as well as similar networks of European police forces and militaries to keep Europeans safe in an era of radical Islamist terrorism, Russian espionage and U.S. disinterest. He has also talked of ecology and prosperity as goals that, in a world increasingly dominated by superpowers, can only be pursued if European states work together.\n\nSome of these ideas are already resonating. Across the continent, a number of parties have won new voters by making ecological arguments. In Germany and Austria, the fortunes of Green parties are rising; in Britain's very weird European parliamentary elections -- thrown together in haste, since Britain was meant to be out of the European Union by now -- the Green party is also projected to reach high levels of support, as are the Liberal Democrats, a pro-European party that was nearly wiped out in the last general election. In Spain and the Netherlands, voters are moving back to center-left parties, precisely because they offer pro-European platforms.\n\nThis is not accidental: Pragmatic actions designed to increase European security -- for example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's deal to keep Syrian refugees in Turkey -- have left a mark. Despite the far-right's heavy investment in automated messaging and partisan social media -- thanks to which they dominate the Twitter debate in many countries -- polls show that most Europeans do not consider \"migration\" to be the main issue in these elections. The chaos of Brexit has also had an impact. Far from dropping, the popularity of the European Union is rising, and a number of far-right parties have hastily rolled back their anti-European rhetoric as a result. The far-right Sweden Democrats have dropped all talk of \"Swexit,\" and France's Marine Le Pen shuns any mention of \"Frexit.\" Across central Europe, it has been highly amusing to watch anti-European parties scramble to wrap themselves in blue European flags during this election campaign, once they realized that majorities of voters -- 91 percent in Poland, for example -- want to stay in Europe, not leave.\n\nThe question, of course, is how fast this reconstruction of European politics around common, positive themes can happen. There are a lot of obstacles in the way: the Kremlin, Islamist militants and a part of the Trump administration are all pushing for the re-division of Europe, in their different ways. Macron himself may not be reelected. A new \"hard Brexit\" prime minister in Britain may well precipitate a crisis. Still, the seeds of what could be a European revival, around new issues, with more pragmatism and less arrogance, are also visible this week. When you read over the next few days about the gains of the far right, remember that their new opponents are part of the story, too.\n\nRead more from Anne Applebaum's archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.\n\nChristian Caryl: Europe is sending us a warning for 2020.

Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday clung to power, going so far as to discuss whether reneging on a new Brexit deal she rolled out two days earlier could mollify cabinet ministers eager to replace her.\n\nHer hopes of trying once more to push her Brexit deal through Parliament were dashed after changes she unveiled to much fanfare on Tuesday -- including opening the door to a second referendum on Brexit -- were rejected by Brexiteers as a betrayal and by Remainers as insufficient. Plans to publish her new plan on Friday were shelved.\n\nBut Mrs. May's undoing seemed more a matter of timing and choreography than anything else. She will meet on Friday with Graham Brady, who leads the committee of Mrs. May's Conservative backbench lawmakers. He is holding onto secret ballots from some of those lawmakers that could allow the party to change its rules and try to unseat Mrs. May almost immediately.\n\nBut the principal focus on Thursday was the European elections, the results of which will not be known until Sunday. They are being seen as a referendum on the main parties' handling of Brexit, and most polls show a humiliating loss for both the Conservatives and Labour.\n\nThe Brexit issue has long paralyzed the main parties, whose ranks contain factions from both sides of the debate and which are constantly splitting the difference, pleasing nobody. As a result, increasingly polarized voters are searching for parties that promote their side unabashedly: the Brexit Party for Leavers and the Liberal Democrats for Remainers who want a second referendum.\n\nAnd the European elections, typically low-turnout affairs dominated by the most ideologically motivated voters, provided an excellent opportunity for voters to flock to those parties to cast a protest vote that reflects their frustrations with the major parties.\n\n\"I'm gutted about Brexit,\" said Stephen Page, 65, a retired London taxi driver and print worker as he leaned on a railing outside a polling station in Barking, a suburban town about 45 minutes east of central London. \"I've literally voted Lib Dem because Corbyn wouldn't, what we call, nail his flag to the mast. He's dithered.\"\n\nHe was talking about the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has for months walked a tightrope on Brexit, refusing to commit to backing either a second referendum in all cases or a compromise Brexit deal with Mrs. May.\n\nMr. Page said he had watched his town change considerably in the past few decades, with the white British population dropping to 50 percent in 2011 from 80 percent a decade earlier in the borough of Barking and Dagenham. During the same period, many immigrants arrived from Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe borough, traditionally a Labour stronghold, elected some far-right councilors from the British National Party in the mid-2000s, and 62 percent voted in 2016 to leave the European Union.\n\nOutside a church preschool serving as a polling station in Dagenham, Olivia Walugembe, 37, a nurse and a refugee from Uganda, said the events of the past three years had awakened immigrants in the town who had ignored Brexit before the 2016 referendum. She said they were especially scared of an end to free movement, the right of European Union citizens to live and work across the bloc.\n\n\"Most black foreigners didn't think it would affect them,\" she said. \"They thought it's only to do with immigration coming from Europe. Now, people have realized it's going to put a stop to so many things, even just free movement, so they've changed their minds.\"\n\nShe said she had voted for Labour because she had detected the party moving toward backing a second referendum.\n\nBut Ms. Walugembe was a rare voter sticking with a mainstream party. In several hours of interviews outside two polling stations, the only man who admitted voting for Mrs. May's Conservative Party hustled away without wanting to explain why.\n\nInstead, most anti-Europeans had cast their lot with the Brexit Party, which has not articulated any policies beyond Brexit and has become a vehicle for Nigel Farage, the populist who played a big role in the Leave campaign in 2016 and is back to rally them again. The party has come under criticism for its finances, but voters were unconcerned.\n\n\"He seems to be the voice of the people,\" said Paul Yetton, 62, after voting. \"I don't trust any of the rest of them.

Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday clung to power, going so far as to discuss whether reneging on a new Brexit deal she rolled out two days earlier could mollify cabinet ministers eager to replace her.\n\nHer hopes of trying once more to push her Brexit deal through Parliament were dashed after changes she unveiled to much fanfare on Tuesday -- including opening the door to a second referendum on Brexit -- were rejected by Brexiteers as a betrayal and by Remainers as insufficient. Plans to publish her new plan on Friday were shelved.\n\nBut Mrs. May's undoing seemed more a matter of timing and choreography than anything else. She will meet on Friday with Graham Brady, who leads the committee of Mrs. May's Conservative backbench lawmakers. He is holding onto secret ballots from some of those lawmakers that could allow the party to change its rules and try to unseat Mrs. May almost immediately.\n\nBut the principal focus on Thursday was the European elections, the results of which will not be known until Sunday. They are being seen as a referendum on the main parties' handling of Brexit, and most polls show a humiliating loss for both the Conservatives and Labour.\n\nThe Brexit issue has long paralyzed the main parties, whose ranks contain factions from both sides of the debate and which are constantly splitting the difference, pleasing nobody. As a result, increasingly polarized voters are searching for parties that promote their side unabashedly: the Brexit Party for Leavers and the Liberal Democrats for Remainers who want a second referendum.\n\nAnd the European elections, typically low-turnout affairs dominated by the most ideologically motivated voters, provided an excellent opportunity for voters to flock to those parties to cast a protest vote that reflects their frustrations with the major parties.\n\n\"I'm gutted about Brexit,\" said Stephen Page, 65, a retired London taxi driver and print worker as he leaned on a railing outside a polling station in Barking, a suburban town about 45 minutes east of central London. \"I've literally voted Lib Dem because Corbyn wouldn't, what we call, nail his flag to the mast. He's dithered.\"\n\nHe was talking about the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has for months walked a tightrope on Brexit, refusing to commit to backing either a second referendum in all cases or a compromise Brexit deal with Mrs. May.\n\nMr. Page said he had watched his town change considerably in the past few decades, with the white British population dropping to 50 percent in 2011 from 80 percent a decade earlier in the borough of Barking and Dagenham. During the same period, many immigrants arrived from Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe borough, traditionally a Labour stronghold, elected some far-right councilors from the British National Party in the mid-2000s, and 62 percent voted in 2016 to leave the European Union.\n\nOutside a church preschool serving as a polling station in Dagenham, Olivia Walugembe, 37, a nurse and a refugee from Uganda, said the events of the past three years had awakened immigrants in the town who had ignored Brexit before the 2016 referendum. She said they were especially scared of an end to free movement, the right of European Union citizens to live and work across the bloc.\n\n\"Most black foreigners didn't think it would affect them,\" she said. \"They thought it's only to do with immigration coming from Europe. Now, people have realized it's going to put a stop to so many things, even just free movement, so they've changed their minds.\"\n\nShe said she had voted for Labour because she had detected the party moving toward backing a second referendum.\n\nBut Ms. Walugembe was a rare voter sticking with a mainstream party. In several hours of interviews outside two polling stations, the only man who admitted voting for Mrs. May's Conservative Party hustled away without wanting to explain why.\n\nInstead, most anti-Europeans had cast their lot with the Brexit Party, which has not articulated any policies beyond Brexit and has become a vehicle for Nigel Farage, the populist who played a big role in the Leave campaign in 2016 and is back to rally them again. The party has come under criticism for its finances, but voters were unconcerned.\n\n\"He seems to be the voice of the people,\" said Paul Yetton, 62, after voting. \"I don't trust any of the rest of them. I think they're all the same.\"\n\nIn Dagenham, Gary McCarthy, 59, a school caretaker who supported Mrs. May in elections two years ago, said that he voted for the Brexit Party and might not return to the Tory fold even if the party kicked out Mrs. May and chose a Brexiteer like the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, as leader.\n\n\"He's still establishment,\" Mr. McCarthy said. \"Somewhere in politics we need a change.\"\n\n\"We need Trump, that's who we need,\" his wife, Carmel McCarthy, 60, interjected. \"At least he's not afraid to say what he thinks.\"\n\nReports piled up throughout the day of European Union citizens living in Britain being turned away from polling stations, despite being registered to vote.

This week's recommended reading includes refreshers on everything from the settling of Polynesia to Brooklyn's past as a queer enclave to the impeachment of Andrew Johnson in 1868. There's art history, in Mar\u00eda Gainza's autofiction about an Argentine critic; and literary history, in Casey Cep's riveting account of the true-crime story that Harper Lee was never able to write; a fictional look back at Palestine in the early 1900s; and a nonfiction analysis of European history from 1950 until the age of Brexit. It's a list that might appeal to the heroine of Binnie Kirshenbaum's novel \"Rabbits for Food,\" were she not sidelined by a crippling depression: \"Bunny's range of interests,\" Kirshenbaum writes early in the book, is \"varied: history, politics, antiques, animal rights, psychology, fashion, and literature, serious literature, although now she is interested in nothing.\" This novel isn't about history per se, but that line -- with its hint that we live at the edge of nihilism, and that all of our distractions are just so much scaffolding against the void -- surely gets at one of history's recurring themes, and one of the reasons we turn to it in the first place for edification and consolation: because we have survived so much (history tells us), and here we are.\n\nGregory Cowles\n\nSenior Editor, Books\n\nTwitter: @GregoryCowles\n\nTHE IMPEACHERS: The Trial of Andrew Johnson and the Dream of a Just Nation, by Brenda Wineapple. (Random House, $32.) The latest from the award-winning Wineapple is about the first impeachment trial in the United States, in 1868, when Andrew Johnson, who ascended to the presidency after Abraham Lincoln's assassination, was nearly voted out of office. (The House overwhelmingly gave him the boot; the Senate saved him.) Wineapple started to research this book six years ago; she briefly mentions Presidents Nixon and Clinton but not the current occupant of the White House. \"She doesn't have to,\" our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. \"The relevance of this riveting and absorbing book is clear enough, even if Wineapple's approach is too literary and incisive to offer anything so obvious as a lesson.\"\n\nFURIOUS HOURS: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee, by Casey Cep. (Knopf, $26.95.) Cep's remarkable first book is really two: a gripping investigation of a rural Alabama preacher who murdered five family members for the insurance in the 1970s, and a sensitive portrait of the novelist Harper Lee, who tried and failed to write her own book about the case. \"It takes Cep about five pages to eliminate from the reader's mind the possibility that the source of Harper Lee's literary problems was lack of material,\" Michael Lewis writes in his review. \"This story is just too good.\" In Cep's probing of \"another writer's failure to write,\" he adds, \"her book makes a magical little leap, and it goes from being a superbly written true-crime story to the sort of story that even Lee would have been proud to write.\"\n\nSEA PEOPLE: The Puzzle of Polynesia, by Christina Thompson. (Harper/HarperCollins, $29.99.) Mystery has long attended the inhabitants of the Pacific's far-flung islands: Where did they come from, when did they get there, and how? Thompson explores these questions, with a particular focus on the early Polynesians' incredible navigational skills, and \"succeeds admirably,\" Simon Winchester writes in his review. The book, he says, makes a \"fascinating and satisfying addition to an already considerable body of Polynesian literature.\"\n\nWHEN BROOKLYN WAS QUEER, by Hugh Ryan. (St. Martin's, $29.99.) This boisterous history captures the variety and creativity of the sexual outsiders who congregated around the economic hub of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a flourishing center of gay life from the middle of the 19th century until well into the 20th. Caleb Crain's review calls it \"an entertaining and insightful chronicle ... enhanced by original research in newspaper archives, unpublished letters and collections of ephemera.\"\n\nTHE GLOBAL AGE: Europe 1950-2017, by Ian Kershaw. (Viking, $40.) At a time of uncertainty and harsh political division, Kershaw's book offers valuable evidence that Europe's recent history was a period of enormous accomplishment, both politically and economically, achieved against obstacles that make many of today's troubles seem minor by comparison. \"Kershaw reminds us that the Continent has faced other large challenges in the postwar era and survived,\" Michael A. McFaul writes in his review; \"that some long-term trends of peace, prosperity and democracy are both robust and remarkable; and that individuals have agency, and can alter the course of events -- they are not mere expressions of those events.\"\n\nTHE PARISIAN, by Isabella Hammad. (Grove, $27.) This strikingly accomplished first novel, set in the early 20th century and modeled in part on the life of the author's grandfather, captures the fate of a European-educated Arab, a man divided, like his native Palestine. Our reviewer, Christopher Benfey, calls it \"a deeply imagined historical novel with none of the usual cobwebs of the genre,\" and says that the book has \"an up-close immediacy and stylistic panache ... all the more impressive coming from a London-born writer still in her 20s.\"\n\nRABBITS FOR FOOD, by Binnie Kirshenbaum. (Soho, $26.) After a New Year's breakdown, the heroine of this furious comic novel checks into a Manhattan mental hospital and starts taking notes. \"Kirshenbaum doesn't trivialize mental breakdown. She makes Bunny's debilitation raw and worrying, and not without its insights,\" Lucy Ellmann writes in her review. \"Being incarcerated paradoxically forces Bunny to reconnect with other people and her own mind. She's alert to the sanity of the insane, and the ineptitude of most of the staff.\" A bracing humor balances the despair.\n\nOPTIC NERVE, by Mar\u00eda Gainza. Translated by Thomas Bunstead. (Catapult, $25.) In this delightful autofiction -- the first book by Gainza, an Argentine art critic, to appear in English -- a woman delivers pithy assessments of world-class painters along with glimpses of her life, braiding the two into an illuminating whole. \"Mar\u00eda's store of information about painters and their lives can make reading the book feel, delightfully, like auditing a course,\" John Williams writes in his review. The book, he adds, \"consistently charms with its tight swirl of art history, personal reminiscence and aesthetic theories.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/23/books/23edchoice-covers/23edchoice-covers-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 296333580}, {"uri": "1143814476", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "17:09:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T17:09:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/amid-calls-for-theresa-may-to-resign-her-party-is-expected-to-flounder-in-european-elections/2019/05/23/bb0d6040-7ca7-11e9-b1f3-b233fe5811ef_story.html", "title": "Amid calls for Theresa May to resign, her party is expected to flounder in European elections", "body": "Prime Minister Theresa May and her husband, Phillip, cast their votes for the European Parliament in her Maidenhead constituency. (Neil Hall/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock) By Karla Adam and Karla Adam London correspondent covering the United Kingdom William Booth William Booth London bureau chief May 23 at 11:59 AM\n\nLONDON -- Britain went to the polls on Thursday for a bizarre election in which the party likely to win the most seats is one that would prefer not to be running at all.\n\nThree years after Britain voted to leave the European Union, and two months after it was supposed to leave, it is participating in elections for the European Parliament, the E.U.'s legislative body. If the polls are correct, arch-euroskeptic Nigel Farage's newly formed Brexit Party is on course to blow the competition out of the water.\n\nVoting is staggered across the continent through Sunday, with results starting to trickle in Sunday night.\n\nIn Europe, all eyes are on whether the populist, nationalist parties do well -- or whether the center holds.\n\nIn Britain, the vote is taking place amid growing speculation about when -- not if -- Prime Minister Theresa May will resign, with some commentators wondering if she can cling to power until the first week of June, when President Trump is due for state visit, including a banquet with Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nEither way, May's fortunes will not be aided by the drubbing her Conservative Party is expected to receive at the ballot box.\n\n\"I'm ashamed to admit I voted for the Brexit Party,\" said Bruce Horton-Gabell, a 41-year-old lawyer, after exiting a polling station in southwest London on Thursday morning.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage leaves a polling station in Biggin Hill, England. (Hannah Mckay/Reuters)\n\nHe said voted to \"remain\" in the 2016 Brexit referendum and is normally a centrist voter -- he once backed Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair and admired former U.S. president Barack Obama. But Horton-Gabell said a \"lack of leadership\" from Britain's two main parties on Brexit deterred him from voting for them.\n\n\"I was devastated when we voted to leave the E.U., but, as somebody who does believe in democracy and believes in what this country can achieve, I felt it was important that we made the most of it and got on with it,\" he said.\n\nThis election also could see pro-Brexit and pro-European forces doing well in Britain. But the pro-European voices are scattered across several parties, including the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party and a new group called Change UK.\n\nA recent YouGov poll had the Brexit Party at 37 percent, Liberal Democrats at 19, Labour at 13, Green at 12 and Conservatives at 7 percent. One of the striking things about the polls is how Britain's two main parties -- Labour and the Conservatives -- are barely in contention.\n\nAnti-establishment parties tend do well in these low-turnout elections that take place every five years. Last time, in 2014, Labour and the Conservatives came in a few points behind the euroskeptic party Farage was then leading. But this time polls have Farage's party beating their combined total.\n\nAnti-Brexit signs rest against a car in London on Thursday. (Peter Nicholls/Reuters)\n\nFarage is a charismatic but divisive figure -- he's among the right-wing politicians who've been pelted with milkshakes on the campaign trail.\n\nOver the course of the campaign, he has come under scrutiny over the source of his donations. The European Parliament said it would investigate allegations, broadcast by Britain's Channel 4, that Farage failed to declare more than $500,000 from British businessman Arron Banks in the year after the 2016 E.U. referendum.\n\nThe money allegedly went to pay Farage's rent, a car lease and a security detail and driver. Farage has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nA Brexit Party triumph could be good news for Boris Johnson, a prominent Brexiteer and former foreign secretary who is leading in polls to replace May.\n\nLike Farage, Johnson has downplayed risks of a \"no deal\" Brexit -- leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement and transition period. Many economists, however, have predicted leaving with no deal could create havoc for Britain and Europe.\n\nMarcus Roberts, international projects director at YouGov, said a big win for the Brexit Party could translate into a boost for Johnson, even though he's from the governing Conservatives.\n\n\"The longer they fail to deliver Brexit, the greater their need for self-flagellation becomes,\" Roberts said, referring to the Conservatives.\n\nThe party's calculation going forward, he said, could be to say, \"'yes, we failed to deliver Brexit but, to make up for that, we're going to pick the most Brexity-Brexiteer we can find.\"\n\nEuropean elections are taking place amid political uncertainty in Britain. (Henry Nicholls/Reuters)\n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has been vague about his stance on whether his party should support a second referendum on Brexit, as many want.\n\nBrian Feltham, 82, a retired chemist, decided to abandon his beloved Labour and vote Liberal Democrats because \"they are the party most likely to keep us in the E.U.\"\n\n\"It would be ridiculous if we were on our own,\" Feltham said. \"Once we were a different country, with an empire. Not anymore. We're much too small now.\"\n\nElizabeth Jago, 39, who was pushing her toddler in a buggy, said she had just voted Liberal Democrat because \"the LibDems will give us the best chance of making the best out of a bad situation.\"\n\n\"Normally I would vote Labour, but I reluctantly voted Liberal Democrats this time because they are anti-Brexit,\" said Norma McArthur, 63, a retired dentist who cast her ballot at a polling station set up at a London nursery school.\n\nAsked what Labour's policy on Brexit was, McArthur shrugged and said, \"I don't know what it is.\"\n\n\"This is mainly a Brexit referendum,\" she added.\n\nRead more\n\nTheresa May holds on, but House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom resigns\n\nFar-right parties hope to undermine E.U. by winning European elections\n\nIn what may be Britain's last European election, Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party is expected to dominate", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5GaF8Z6JX_KhEhyMOYpdjieQa8o=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EHTDQOT5OII6TDW66SV7KIPPC4.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800134", "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 296327340}, {"uri": "1143757222", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "16:06:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T16:06:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/eu-elections-primer-how-they-work-what-could-happen/2019/05/23/bce7668e-7d71-11e9-b1f3-b233fe5811ef_story.html", "title": "EU elections primer: How they work, what could happen", "body": "By Lorne Cook\u2009|\u2009AP May 23 at 11:45 AM\n\nBRUSSELS -- European voters started heading to the polls Thursday to choose lawmakers to represent them at the European Parliament for the next five years. In all, 400 million voters in 28 nations will be voting over the next four days. Here's a look at that massive exercise in democracy, a multi-national ballot by the European Union's only democratically elected institution.\n\n___\n\nWHO, WHEN, WHAT ON THE EU VOTE?\n\nEurope's voting marathon kicked off Thursday in the Netherlands and in Britain . Voters in Ireland turn out on Friday, those in the Czech Republic, Latvia, Malta and Slovakia vote on Saturday and the remaining 21 EU nations cast their ballots on Sunday.\n\nVoters in each EU nation choose some of the 751 lawmakers in the European Parliament, which sits in both Brussels and Strasbourg, France.\n\nSeats in the European Parliament are doled out proportionally based on a nation's population. Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta have the fewest seats with six each, while the EU's most populous member, Germany, has 96 seats.\n\nThe results from every nation will be released on Sunday after the last polling station in the continent is closed.\n\n___\n\nHOW IMPORTANT IS THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT?\n\nThe assembly's powers are slowly growing. It's helped to improve air flight safety in Europe, cut down plastics use, end mobile telephone roaming charges within the bloc, boost data privacy, set climate change ambitions and reduce carbon dioxide emissions from cars.\n\nThe assembly also has a say in treaties ranging from trade talks to Brexit.\n\nThe EU's powerful executive arm, the European Commission, proposes laws while EU lawmakers amend and negotiate their content with national governments, which are the real font of European power and are represented by the EU Council.\n\nOften, the big impact of these EU elections is on the domestic politics of individual EU nations, like support in Britain for the anti-Europe U.K. Independence Party in 2014 or the massive gains in France by Marine Le Pen's far-right National Front party, which has now rebranded as the National Rally. The polls are often used by disgruntled citizens to cast protest votes against their own national governments.\n\n___\n\nWHAT ARE THE ISSUES IN THE EU ELECTION?\n\nThere are no \"European citizens\" as such, so voters tend to respond to national interests.\n\nHow Europe handles migration is a very significant concern for voters in Italy, Hungary, Poland and elsewhere. Economic concerns often influence voters, and Britain's future in the EU looks like being a factor again.\n\nAn EU survey of public sentiment in April found that voters were most concerned about the economy, unemployment, immigration, the environment and climate change, terrorism and promoting human rights, democracy and social welfare.\n\n___\n\nWHO'S LIKELY TO WIN WHAT?\n\nThe projections from April suggest that the center-right European People's Party will remain the biggest bloc in the European Parliament with an estimated 180 seats, dropping from 217 seats in 2014.\n\nThe center-left Socialists and Democrats group is also expected to lose ground, sliding from 186 seats to 149.\n\nAmong other mainstream parties, the liberal ALDE alliance is expected to capture 76 seats, eight more than in 2014, while the Greens could rank fourth with some 57 seats, up from 52. However, the liberals now appear set to create a new group with French President Emmanuel Macron's centrist party.\n\nAs for the far-right and nationalists, the Europe of Nations and Freedom group, which combines parties like Italy's League, Britain's UKIP and France's far-right National Rally, is predicted to win 62 seats, compared to 37 currently.\n\nNew parties such the Brexit Party in Britain are listed as \"other\" in a mixed bunch that is forecast to expand from 21 seats to 62.\n\n___\n\nHOW WILL THE VOTE CHANGE EUROPE?\n\nEurope's mainstream political groups appear set to hold control over the assembly but, depending on the results, they could be pressured into uncomfortable compromises or awkward alliances in order to pass EU legislation.\n\nPopulist and nationalist parties have found rising support in national elections in many EU countries, but their pan-European impact would depend on whether they can form a strong political group in Brussels. That certainly is their goal. Italy's hard-line interior minister, Matteo Salvini, head of the League party, has been putting together a populist group of national parties that he says aims to fundamentally shake up EU politics.\n\nForming such a group is not easy -- 25 lawmakers are required, with at least one-quarter of the EU's 28 nations represented -- but it's important because it opens up valuable access to EU funds and political influence.\n\n___\n\nWHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE ELECTIONS?\n\nOnce the results are in, the newly elected EU lawmakers will begin haggling to form parliamentary groups.\n\nThe present European Parliament's term ends July 1 and the new parliament will take their seats in Strasbourg the following day. At the first plenary on July 2, they will elect the president, 14 vice presidents and five other senior officials in the House, as well as decide on the number and composition of parliamentary committees.\n\nEU leaders will meet on Tuesday to choose candidates for the bloc's top jobs. Between July and October, the assembly is called on to endorse those candidates, notably the new president of the European Commission. Parliamentary hearings will then begin to confirm EU commissioners in charge of specific policies.\n\n___\n\nFor more news from The Associated Press on the European Parliament elections go to https://www.apnews.com/EuropeanParliament\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

(J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post) By Kathy Orton Kathy Orton Reporter and editor covering the Washington metropolitan area housing market May 23 at 10:03 AM\n\nFixed mortgage rates didn't go down much, but they did go down for the fourth week in a row.\n\nAccording to the latest data released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate average slipped to 4.06 percent with an average 0.5 point. (Points are fees paid to a lender equal to 1 percent of the loan amount and are in addition to the interest rate.) It was 4.07 percent a week ago and 4.66 percent a year ago. The 30-year fixed rate matched its lowest level of the year, set back at the end of March.\n\nThe 15-year fixed-rate average dipped to 3.51 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 3.53 percent a week ago and 4.15 percent a year ago. The five-year adjustable rate average ticked up to 3.68 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 3.66 percent a week ago and 3.87 percent a year ago.\n\nZillow economic analyst Matthew Speakman said the lack of economic data released this week meant the financial markets focused more on the U.S.-China trade negotiations.\n\n\"The one event with the potential to drastically influence rates -- the reading of the minutes from last month's Federal Open Market Committee meeting -- offered little in the way of new forward guidance, keeping bond yields, which dictate mortgage rates, at bay,\" Speakman said. \"The U.S.-China trade tensions -- along with other geopolitical issues such as Brexit and intensifying political tensions in the Middle East -- have pushed rates downward in recent weeks. While substantial uncertainty remains, the pace of provocative headlines has subsided in recent days, which could result in some upward pressure on rates, if the trend holds. A sharp rebound appears unlikely, but so long as the trade tensions don't escalate and upcoming economic releases offer few surprises, modest rate increases could be on the horizon in the immediate term.\"\n\nBankrate.com, which puts out a weekly mortgage rate trend index, found that two-thirds of the experts it surveyed expect rates to remain relatively stable in the coming week.\n\n\"Pending clear direction on the trade dispute between the United States and China, interest rates will likely be directionless,\" said Robert Johnson, professor of finance at Creighton University.\n\nMeanwhile, fueled by borrowers looking to refinance their loans, mortgage applications picked up. According to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the market composite index -- a measure of total loan application volume -- increased 2.4 percent from a week earlier. The refinance index grew 8 percent from the previous week, while the purchase index dropped 2 percent.\n\nThe refinance share of mortgage activity accounted for 40.5 percent of all applications.\n\n\"Mortgage applications increased 2.4 percent last week and were 15.4 percent higher than a year ago, with declining mortgage rates leading to a jump in refinance activity,\" said Bob Broeksmit, MBA president and CEO. \"Despite lower borrowing costs, purchase applications were slightly down but maintained their 14-week run of outpacing year ago levels. Supply and affordability challenges are still slowing some prospective buyers, but most of the country continues to see strong demand.\"\n\nMore Real Estate:\n\nHome lenders are becoming more friendly to riskier applicants\n\nNeed a boost to your credit rating?

Putin of Russia stirs strong emotions in Britain.\n\nNow, the BBC is hoping to mine the Russian leader's fame -- or infamy -- with a comedy series presented by a digital effigy of Mr. Putin, who cackles in a trailer for the program that his next great geopolitical victory will be to host the \"No. 1 chat show in the U.K.\"\n\nThe satirical show, called \"Tonight With Vladimir Putin,\" uses a three-dimensional cartoon of Mr. Putin interviewing real guests in front of an audience, the BBC announced on Wednesday.\n\nWhether the Kremlin will see the funny side is debatable.\n\n\"He doesn't often get mocked and I don't think that he'll like it,\" said Joanna Szostek, a lecturer in political communication at the University of Glasgow.\n\n\"It's not going to help bilateral relations, obviously,\" Dr. Szostek added, noting that Moscow was likely to see the show as politically motivated because it considered the BBC a propaganda arm of the British government. The tone of the show could feed the Kremlin narrative that Western criticism of Mr. Putin was driven by an anti-Russian agenda, she said.\n\nThe Putin caricature begins the trailer provocatively. \"Greetings, people of the 'United Kingdom'!\" the digital puppet yells outside Buckingham Palace, miming air quotes in a less-than-subtle reference to the bruising political battles around Britain's departure from the European Union and the fractious elections for the European Parliament which are being held this week.\n\nIn the first episode, planned to air on June 14, \"Mr. Putin\" -- or \"everybody's favorite bear-wrestling global strongman,\" as the BBC described him -- will meet Alastair Campbell, the onetime spokesman for former Prime Minister Tony Blair. In the next episode, the digital host will try \"to get his head around feminism\" in a discussion with the comedian and podcaster Deborah Frances-White, according to the statement.\n\nThe sharp intake of breath from observers of Russian politics was almost audible after the BBC's announcement. Comments on Twitter from Moscow-based journalists and researchers included a face-palm emoji in reaction to the puppet's accent and a warning that the broadcaster was \"playing with fire.\"\n\nIn Russia, such a caricature would be unthinkable nowadays. A show in the 1990s on the Russian network NTV, called \"Puppets,\" featured a cartoon figure of Mr. Putin and other prominent politicians, including former President Boris Yeltsin. But the show was discontinued soon after Mr. Putin assumed the presidency in 2000 and nothing like it has been shown on television since.\n\nDmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesman, dismissed the BBC show in a conference call with journalists on Friday. \"Lots of books have been written about Putin, lots of caricatures have been drawn, lots of puppets and cartoons have been created,\" he said.\n\n\"Putin hasn't read books about himself or looked at caricatures,\" Mr. Peskov added. \"He doesn't want to take after them. Let these caricatures take after him.\"\n\nRussia Today, the English-language network that is widely seen as part of the Kremlin's propaganda machine, also raised an arched eyebrow.\n\n\"The show appears to be a regurgitated dystopian nightmare,\" the Russian broadcaster said on its website.\n\n\"Surprisingly, many people were able to overcome bouts of nausea and cringe-induced spasms long enough to air their disgust,\" the article continued, citing negative reaction on Twitter.\n\nA spokeswoman for the BBC said on Wednesday that the show's creators would not be available to comment.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "palko_karasz@nytimes.com", "name": "Palko Karasz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/22/world/22bbc-putin/22bbc-putin-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4804631", "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 296309940}, {"uri": "1143536516", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "11:39:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T11:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/23/is-this-end-theresa-may-ban-reporting-during-eu-elections-means-viewers-wont-know-yet/", "title": "Is this the end for Theresa May?

REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/File Photo (Henry Nicholls/Reuters) By Rick Noack Rick Noack Foreign affairs reporter focusing on Europe and international security May 23 at 7:07 AM\n\nIf you looked at a British newspaper front page on Thursday, you would get the impression of a political apocalypse -- at least if you're a fan of Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\n\"TEARESA,\" The Sun newspaper writes, illustrated with a photo of an emotional May in the back seat of her car.\n\n\"TEARS IN THE BACK SEAT 2,\" is the Daily Mirror's version of events, a clear reference to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's tearful departure after being ousted in 1990.\n\nIn the late evening hours on Wednesday, House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom quit the government cabinet in another blow to the troubled prime minister.\n\nThere is no evidence to substantiate rumors that May's downfall would happen today, but the next hours may still be fateful for her future.\n\n[Theresa May holds on, but House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom resigns]\n\nNormally, it should become one of those days: A nation glued to TV screens or smartphone livestreams, waiting for what's been described as the inevitable for several months now -- maneuvering about May's potential departure.\n\nBut those living in Britain might have to wait until 10 p.m. to find out all the details from their televisions.\n\nOddly, one of the perhaps most fateful weeks in recent British political history coincides with yet another politically fateful week for the future of the European Union. About 400 million Europeans across the E.U. are eligible to vote in European Parliament elections. Not everyone is voting at the same time. On Sunday, for instance, it will be the Germans' turn. Today, it's the turn of a nation that didn't even want to be in the club of E.U. member states anymore: Britain.\n\nAfter a chaotic exit from the exit in March, British lawmakers struggled to agree on how exactly they would like to leave. Many blame May for failing to consult them over the last two years and for pushing them to agree to her deal, which a majority of MPs say is deeply flawed.\n\nThat's why they want May to go.\n\nBut that's also why British broadcasters might struggle to fully report on it today, of all days.\n\nGiven that Brits are heading to E.U. polls today, strict reporting laws are taking effect that may prevent certain developments from becoming widely known until tonight, after polls across the E.U. have closed by 10 p.m. British time. \"There will be no coverage of the election campaign on polling day, from 00.30 until polls close at 22.00 on TV, radio or bbc.co.uk,\" the BBC states on its website.\n\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg already said goodbye (\"in theory\") to her Twitter followers on Wednesday night, adding \"that's more or less it from me\" until the restrictions end.\n\nThe BBC did not completely ignore rumors over May's looming departure this morning, but if those rumors proved to be true the broadcaster could face a host of problems across its airwaves.\n\nSome restrictions will remain in place until Sunday, when polls have closed across the continent, even though newspapers and most websites are not impacted by those rules.\n\n\"Whilst the polls are open throughout Europe, it is a criminal offence to broadcast anything about the way in which people have voted in that election or to forecast the election result, which includes how a particular party or candidate may have fared, based on how people have voted,\" the BBC's guidelines state.\n\nThat means, if May's opponents changed existing rules to topple her or if she resigned herself -- citing potentially devastating results for her Conservative Party in the European elections -- the BBC wouldn't be able to report on those reasons. If politicians said anything along those lines live on air, they may have to be cut off until Sunday, The Guardian newspaper reported.\n\nThat sounds more similar to the experience of watching Western TV in countries like China and stands in a stark contrast to the United States, where election days draw huge audience numbers so that people can know what's going on with the voting.\n\nIn comparison, British TV on election days is relatively boring. News anchors will pretty much say: The vote is happening -- and now, the weather.\n\nThe idea is that last-minute scandals or developments could swing a vote, without giving journalists proper time to investigate the stories or politicians time to react. Then-FBI Director James Comey's announcement of a reopened Clinton email probe days ahead of the election proved that the British may have a point here.\n\nBritain also isn't the only country with such restrictions. France, for instance, has a similar rule that takes effect 44 hours before legislative or presidential elections. During those two days, French media outlets are banned from covering \"electoral propaganda,\" but that could include anything from statements from candidates to electoral polls.\n\nIt's a rule that's designed to preserve the integrity of elections in which voters can topple the current political leader.\n\nBut today isn't one of those days: European elections (theoretically) only determine the composition of the future European Parliament, but have no direct impact on May's ability to govern at home.\n\nThat's why, if there are dramatic developments on May's future, British broadcasters may push the limits of those rules until 10 p.m.\n\nIn a polarized Britain, many might have made up their minds before then, anyway.\n\nMilkshake-wielding protesters trap Nigel Farage on his Brexit bus\n\nTheresa May holds on, but House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom resigns", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ut8N8wqkAzyPEAVy8YcO_b6F2zo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/47YTQED4XQI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 296307540}, {"uri": "1143484020", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "10:36:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T10:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/23/things-know-about-european-parliament-elections/", "title": "Five things to know about Europe's surprisingly dramatic parliamentary elections", "body": "(Washington Post illustration/iStock) By Ruby Mellen Ruby Mellen Research assistant for the Today's WorldView newsletter May 23 at 6:00 AM\n\nAcross Europe, voting begins Thursday in European Parliament elections, which will continue through Sunday. The elections are hotly anticipated across the continent, with many people wondering how the results will affect the future of the European Union and the bloc's dealings with the rest of the world. With the help of our correspondents in Europe, we answer five key questions about the elections and the legislative body.\n\nWhat is the European Parliament?\n\nThe 751-member legislature is most notable for being, as Deutsche Welle puts it, \"the only democratically legitimized supranational institution in the world.\" In other words: It is the only assembly made of various countries where the people of those countries can directly vote for their representatives. It is also notable for the large numbers of voters in its elections. More than 370 million people are eligible to vote, making these the second largest elections in the world, behind India's.\n\nMembers of European Parliament are sent as representatives of the 28 countries in the E.U. Each country decides how the elections are held. Anything goes as long as the ballots are secret and women and men can both vote. (The voting age is 18 everywhere but Austria, where it is 16.) Seats are apportioned to each country according to the size of its population. Germany, the E.U.'s most populous state, has 96 representatives, while small countries like Cyprus, Malta and Luxembourg have six each. That said, members of the European Parliament -- or MEPs -- do not always vote along nationality lines. Once elected to the European Parliament, they join larger parties and coalitions.\n\nMEPs are elected to five-year terms and have a say in the bloc's finances, international presence and general direction. Since the Lisbon Treaty of 2009, which expanded the body's powers, the European Parliament has appointed the head of the European Commission, the E.U.'s executive body, approved or rejected international agreements such as a recent trade pact with Singapore, and decided on the E.U.'s full budget. The body is involved in decisions on a vast array of topics, including agriculture and fisheries, environmental issues and migration policies.\n\nWho are the key players to watch for in these elections?\n\nThere are eight political groups in the European Parliament. Forming a group requires at least 25 members from at least seven countries. The largest groups are the center-right European People's Party (EPP) and the center-left Socialists and Democrats. Both are expected to lose seats as voters show an appetite for more-extreme views on the left and the right.\n\nThe EPP is likely to lose seats to more-nationalist and Euroskeptic parties. This will be especially crucial in the case of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party. The EPP suspended Fidesz in March over its rejection of E.U. migration policies. Now Orban is calling for the group to join forces with far-right parties such as Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini's League party, and French politician Marine Le Pen's National Rally. The head of the EPP has already ruled out such an alliance, but, as Politico noted, Orban has said \"he would find it hard to stick with the EPP if it forms an alliance with 'pro-migration' parties on the left.\"\n\nIt's also worth keeping an eye on the fortunes of Britain's Euroskeptic Brexit Party, which is led by Nigel Farage. A recent poll showed the Brexit Party has more support than Britain's mainstream liberal and conservative parties combined -- a little bit ironic considering that if the party had its way, Britain would already be out of the E.U. and not be represented in European Parliament at all.\n\nMeanwhile, on the left, other parties are expected to gain ground. According to the Associated Press, polling in April showed that the progressive Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, backed by French President Emmanuel Macron, is projected to gain eight seats, bringing its number to 76, and that the Green party could win 57 seats, five more than it now holds.\n\nUltimately, the new Parliament could reflect what is occurring in governments all around Europe: a weakening of the center that is forcing political realignment on the major issues shaping the world.\n\nWait, there's a Brexit Party? What does that mean for Brexit? (From the London bureau's William Booth and Karla Adam)\n\nYep. This is an election few thought would occur in Britain, given that the country voted three years ago to leave the E.U. and was to have quit the bloc two months ago. The questions are understandable. Will Britain's 73 new representatives to the E.U.'s legislative body serve for days, weeks or years? Who knows? The chaos is made more sensational by the forecast that this nascent, single-issue party is going to blow everyone else out of the water, with the potential to influence how Brexit turns out and how long Prime Minister Theresa May stays in office. The demands of the Brexit Party seem simple: Get us out of the E.U. Now. Honor the 2016 referendum result.\n\nA big win for the Brexit Party could push May and her Conservatives to hurriedly pass a deal before parliamentarians take up their seats in July, or, as Farage prefers, leave the E.U. with no deal. Writing in the Guardian, former Labour prime minister Tony Blair described the stakes: \"This is not a vote to choose a prime minister or a government. It is a vote for the Farage Brexit -- or against it.\"\n\nAlternatively, a good showing from the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats or Change UK might embolden those in the British Parliament who want a second referendum on Brexit.\n\nWhat about the far right? What does it hope to gain? (From Brussels bureau chief Michael Birnbaum and Berlin bureau chief Griff Witte)\n\nSince the last election in 2014, the E.U. has been hammered by a refugee crisis, multiple mass-casualty terrorist attacks, a vote by the British people to exit the bloc, a security scare fueled by the Kremlin and a fitful economic recovery after the global financial crisis. Such issues are pulling voters to the fringes, and far-right and other parties that are hostile to the E.U. appear poised to control more seats than ever before.\n\nFrom grand palazzi in Rome to Art Nouveau villas in Budapest, Europe's anti-migration right-wingers have been prepping their battering rams to knock down the doors of the European Parliament. No one expects them to win a majority, but their aim is less to legislate than to obstruct. A greater far-right presence could have a disproportionate effect on how the E.U. functions, putting the far right in a position to play spoiler. And a legislature with less ability to get things done would feed the narrative of the E.U.'s nationalist critics, who argue that the bloc is fundamentally broken.\n\nBut for Europe's critics to wield maximum influence, they will need to work together -- something they have failed to do so far.\n\nWith all these Euroskeptic players involved, is there a threat of Russian interference in these elections? (From Brussels bureau chief Michael Birnbaum)\n\nIt doesn't seem likely. At least yet. Parliament, politicians, security services and social media companies that were bracing for an onslaught from Russia have been surprised that, so far, they seem to have avoided one.\n\nExperts are cautious about saying Russian interference has been neutralized, but the anxiety has shifted somewhat inward, as many of the disinformation tactics pioneered by Russia have been domesticated and are being replicated on both extremes of the political debate in Europe.\n\nThat said, Russia is still working openly to promote political division in Europe. The Sputnik news agency has offered wall-to-wall coverage of the \"yellow vest\" protests that have shaken France. The German-language homepage of RT, formerly Russia Today, recently featured a banner debunking \"myths\" that the former West Germany was superior to communist East Germany. But the scale of what has been identified is nothing compared with the past -- or with what the Europeans had anticipated.\n\nIn part, far-right parties in Europe have not needed Russia, because some of their domestic supporters have mimicked Russia's strategy of promoting disinformation and amplifying it through the use of automated social media accounts.\n\nRead more:\n\nIn what may be Britain's last European election, Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party is expected to dominate\n\nFar-right parties hope to undermine E.U. by winning European elections\n\nEurope's far right says it is united.

Being quite sure about things has been a central organizing principle of her life. It has informed most every character she has played.\n\nThe kindly aristocrat in \"Howards End.\" The lovelorn housekeeper in \"The Remains of the Day.\" The bonneted sister of \"Sense and Sensibility.\" The batty Hogwarts professor, the warty Nanny McPhee, the fusspot creator of Mary Poppins, and the caustic television host in her new film, \"Late Night,\" due June 7. Even when they are tearfully coming apart, the characters share with Thompson an ironclad sense of self and of how things ought to be.\n\nTime did not soften this Thompsonian resolve, or so it seemed. This year, after learning that John Lasseter, who lost his top job at Pixar and Disney for unwanted touching, was named head of the studio producing a film she was working on, Thompson publicly quit and flamed the studio, and Lasseter, in a scathing open letter. A few months before that, she showed up in white sneakers to her knighthood ceremony, which was led by Prince William. When the English press affected shock, Thompson shot back that the shoes were designed by Stella McCartney, thank you very much, and actually quite posh.\n\nIt came as a great surprise to Thompson, then, to suddenly find herself on uncertain ground occasioned by her 60th birthday in April. It was not that she balked at her age. Suggestions of \"60 is the new 40!\" make her eyes roll. \"The denial of aging is unhealthy,\" she sniffed in a recent chat. \"It's always been bollocks.\" But she was flooded by discomfiting questions of her own about roles she had enthusiastically embraced throughout her life: as daughter, wife, mother, performer. She was still all of those things, but now she's on the verge of being an empty nester.\n\n\"There's lots of these roles that are in fact imposed on you by society, for years and years and years, then you suddenly go -- am I any of those things? And if I'm not, who am I?\" Thompson said.\n\n\"The eternal question, which I never thought I'd ask, is who am I?\" she continued. \"I was always so sure. As it turns out, I have no idea.\"\n\nThompson had scheduled our interview between her first ever trip to Las Vegas, which she found \"eye-watering,\" and an appearance at the Extinction Rebellion environmental protest in London, where she was filmed speechifying into a mic in a pink boat surrounded by police.\n\nShe had gone to Vegas to promote two new movies at a convention of theater owners: \"Late Night,\" which Mindy Kaling wrote for her, and \"Last Christmas,\" which Thompson wrote with the English artist Bryony Kimmings, and which is loosely based, somehow, on the song of the same name by the '80s group Wham!\n\nIn Vegas, Thompson had an 11-hour break between presentations, during which time she gambled, napped, ate and drank. By the end of the day, she felt like she had been there for 50 years, wondered if that was what everybody in Vegas felt, and was seized by the need to escape lest she suffocate and die.\n\nThe Extinction Rebellion protesters, by contrast, exhilarated her, so much so she made a short film in their support. Thompson is a lifelong environmentalist and tries to stay optimistic, having read that optimists live longer, yet, like so many earthlings these days, has trouble warding off eco-despair. \"Cara,\" she said, \"we are in a race, as you know, against consciousness and catastrophe.\"\n\nWe were sitting in a suite at a swanky Beverly Hills hotel that was all genteel charcoals and dove grays. Against it, Thompson was a kinetic pop. Her platinum plume of hair was in a state of floppy disarray suggestive of multiple rakings by harried fingers, and she had on her famous Stella McCartney sneakers along with an ensemble the color of lime sorbet, which I murmured appreciation for; it was a palate cleanser, just like her! \"It's pistachio, darling,\" she corrected.\n\nAmericans tend to view Thompson the way they do many of her fellow dames -- Dench, Mirren, Smith -- as a beloved no-nonsense Mary Poppins type highly adept at setting people straight. But back home in England, Thompson's outspokenness and environmentalism have at times put her in the cross hairs of the country's outrage-industrial complex. The press pilloried her for describing England, in the run-up to the Brexit vote, as a \"cake-filled, misery-laden gray old island,\" and gloated when an irate farmer came close to drenching her with manure during an anti-fracking protest in 2016.\n\nThompson professes to not care a bit. \"The Murdochian press are a law unto themselves,\" she said. She is far more concerned not just with the fate of the planet but also the minor matter of figuring out who exactly she is. \"I have some questions that I hope to answer in the next 10 years,\" she said.\n\nThompson grew up in an acting family. Her father, Eric Thompson, created and performed the English version of \"The Magic Roundabout\" children's show, and her mother is the Scottish actress Phyllida Law. Thompson went to Cambridge, joined the Cambridge Footlights comedy sketch revue, befriended Stephen Fry, dated Hugh Laurie and, in the late '80s, fell in love with and married Kenneth Branagh, whom she met while working on a World War II-era television drama.\n\nA few years later, the director James Ivory cast her in her breakthrough role in the British class drama \"Howards End\" as the well-heeled, earnest Margaret Schlegel, who gets involved with Anthony Hopkins's upper-crust widower. She won an Oscar for her performance, and landed two more Oscar nominations (lead and supporting actress) the following year, for \"The Remains of the Day\" and \"In the Name of the Father.\" Branagh, meanwhile, had taken a shine to Thompson's \"Howards End\" co-star, Helena Bonham Carter, whom he'd worked with on his 1994 film, \"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.\" Branagh and Carter ended up in a relationship and he and Thompson divorced in 1995, a year that would prove a major inflection point in Thompson's life.\n\nThe producer Lindsay Doran had caught a television broadcast of Thompson's comedy sketches, and asked her to adapt Jane Austen's \"Sense and Sensibility.\" Directed by Ang Lee and starring Thompson, Kate Winslet and Hugh Grant, the 1995 film was a global hit. Thompson went on to win an Oscar for best adapted screenplay, making her the only person to win Academy Awards for both acting and writing. The film also starred Greg Wise as the dashing, dastardly John Willoughby. She and Wise, seven years her junior, ended up hitting it off splendidly. They married in 2003 and have a daughter, Gaia, who is 19, and an adopted son, Tindyebwa Agaba, a former refugee and child soldier. Wise's recent gigs include appearing as Lord Mountbatten on \"The Crown\" and a winning turn on \"The Great Celebrity Bake Off.\" Thompson said that after she was knighted, Wise asked her if he could be known as Lady Greg. No, alas, per Order of the British Empire rules.\n\nThompson had shot to international stardom in her 30s, but she said that by the time she hit her 40s, she was being offered the dullest of roles -- she guesses because she could still be thought of, \"in a pinch,\" as sexual. But once she got into her 50s and past all that, the parts that came her way were far more interesting.\n\nThey included the finicky \"Mary Poppins\" author P.L. Travers in \"Saving Mr. Banks\" (\"Such a wonderful role. I even managed to live with the perm\"); the harridan chain-smoker of a mother in \"Barney Thomson,\" about a Scottish serial killer; and, in Noah Baumbach's \"The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),\" the drunken wife of Dustin Hoffman's narcissistic washed-up artist.\n\nThompson adored working with Hoffman, and said it was only afterward that she learned of accusations of impropriety made against him -- Hoffman responded to one allegation with an apology, and when others surfaced, denied wrongdoing -- and that she would have to talk to him before considering working with him again.\n\nOn the Lasseter matter, she was far more clear. Though he apologized for his behavior, Thompson admonished the studio, Skydance Animation, for potentially forcing employees into deciding between uncomfortably working with Lasseter or not working at all. After her letter went public, Thompson said, thanks came in from others who walked away from Skydance jobs for the same reason. \"They're the ones who are brave,\" she said. \"I can go onto another project and get paid. For other people, it's not so easy.\"\n\nI asked her about how men like Lasseter who have been #Me Too-ed might come back.\n\n\"I don't want to be thinking about men's problems at the moment, thanks so much,\" Thompson said. She said she had given the issue some thought and acknowledged it was thorny, but added, speaking of the men, \"I'm sure they'll grow up and sort it out. Because it's their problem, not mine.\" She would far rather talk about women. \"If you get born into this body, it's a different journey,\" she said. \"Whether you like it or not.\"\n\nThompson's big beef with most roles written for women is that they have gone from one extreme to the other, from the hopelessly domestic support-or-pine-for-a-man characters she felt swamped with early in her career, to, these days, women being straight-out badasses.\n\n\"Women now invent the weapons and shoot the weapons and are tough and not allowed to cry,\" Thompson said. \"We skipped from being in the kitchen to being in the tank, and there's nothing in between. So we still have failed to explore and bring to the screen what being a woman is.\"\n\nAn exception, she said, was \"Late Night,\" which Thompson described as one of the best scripts she'd read.\n\nIn it, Thompson plays a sharp-tongued late-night host, Katherine Newbury, who reluctantly hires a token woman (Kaling) for her all-male writing staff in an effort to keep her show relevant and on the air. Kaling wrote the part for Thompson (Vanity Fair called it her \"best role in years\") because she needed someone who could get away with saying almost anything. \"I knew Katherine would be cruel at times but always needed to be funny,\" Kaling said.\n\nThompson and Kaling crafted Newbury as a composite of hard-driving people they knew. Like Thompson, Newbury is tough and complex. Unlike her, she is an anti-feminist who does nothing to pull other women up, at least until she feels she has to. \"She's very single-minded, shall we say, which is generally thought of as a male trait,\" Thompson said. \"And men are allowed to be single-minded, aren't they?\"\n\nCircling back to Thompson's earlier years, I asked James Ivory what it was about Thompson that prompted him to cast her in \"Howards End.\" He replied that he was struck by her groundedness and brights. She was simply, he said, so very sane.\n\n\"A lot of actors and actresses are very fearful and timid and cover that up with all kinds of strange behavior you could call crazy, forever thinking they're not good, that they're failing,\" Ivory told me. \"There was none of that with her.\" She also smoothed out some on-set tensions he had with Hopkins, becoming the go-between both men trusted. By the time filming ended, Ivory said, he felt he had a great friend in Thompson. He was also a bit forlorn: \"There was really a sense of loss that this delightful person wasn't going to be around every day.\"\n\nThompson has this effect on people. That includes me -- even though I spent just 90 minutes with her -- and Nisha Ganatra, who directed \"Late Night.\"\n\nDuring production, Ganatra said she studied Thompson closely, trying to figure out how the actress seemed to live her life with such brilliance and grace. She concluded it had a lot to do with Thompson being present and humble. Ganatra watched as Thompson passed out Italian chocolates late one night to the crew, and reached up to absent-mindedly stroke the leaves of a tree she walked under one rainy day.\n\nGanatra said she found herself wanting Thompson to be her confidant and her life coach. \"I wanted to be her,\" Ganatra said.\n\nIndeed, Thompson may profess to not know who she is anymore, but to the rest of the world, it is, as always, crystal clear.\n\n\"I asked her, 'What's it like to have all the answers?'\" Ganatra said. \"She just laughed and said, 'I don't.' But she does.\"\n\nMore on Emma ThompsonEmma Thompson Letter Explains Why She Backed Out of Movie Over LasseterFeb. 26, 2019Sundance 2019 Movies That Could Become Oscar ContendersFeb. 1, 2019", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cara_buckley@nytimes.com", "name": "Cara Buckley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/26/arts/26emma-thompson-2/26emma-thompson-2-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4807442", "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 296295000}, {"uri": "1143307230", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "06:44:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T06:44:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/dutch-polls-open-kicking-off-4-days-of-european-elections/2019/05/23/66c72ae6-7d1c-11e9-b1f3-b233fe5811ef_story.html", "title": "Dutch, UK polls open, starting 4 days of European elections", "body": "By Mike Corder\u2009|\u2009AP May 23 at 1:59 AM\n\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Dutch polls opened Thursday in elections for the European Parliament, starting four days of voting across the 28-nation bloc that pits supporters of deeper integration against populist Euroskeptics who want more power for their national governments.\n\nA half hour after voting started in the Netherlands, polls open across the United Kingdom, the only other country voting Thursday, and a nation still wrestling with its plans to leave the European Union altogether and the leadership of embattled Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\nThe elections, which end Sunday night, come as support is surging for populists and nationalists who want to rein in the EU's powers, while traditional powerhouses like France and Germany insist that unity is the best buffer against the shifting economic and security interests of an emerging new world order.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron says the challenge is \"not cede to a coalition of destruction and disintegration\" that will seek to dismantle EU unity built up over the past six decades.\n\nIn a significant challenge to those centrist forces, populists appear largely united heading into the elections. On Saturday, Italy's anti-migrant Interior Minister Matteo Salvini was joined at a rally by 10 other nationalist leaders, including include far-right leaders Marine Le Pen of France's National Rally party and Joerg Meuthen of the Alternative for Germany party.\n\nVoters across Europe elect a total of 751 lawmakers, although that number is set to drop to 705 when the UK leaves the EU. The Dutch make up just 26 currently and 29 after Brexit. The UK has 73 European lawmakers, who would lose their jobs when their country completes its messy divorce from the EU.\n\nResults of the four days of voting will not be officially released until Sunday night, but Dutch national broadcaster NOS will publish an exit poll after ballot boxes close Thursday night.\n\nThe Netherlands could provide a snapshot of what is to come. Polls show the right-wing populist Forum for Democracy led by charismatic intellectual Thierry Baudet running neck-and-neck with the center-right VVD party of Prime Minister Mark Rutte.\n\nWhile the country, an affluent trading nation, profits from the EU's open borders and single market, it also is a major contributor to EU coffers. Skeptical Dutch voters in 2005 rejected a proposed EU constitution in a referendum.\n\nBaudet, whose party emerged as a surprise winner of provincial elections in March, identifies more with hard-line Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban than with the nationalist populist movement led by Salvini, although in a debate Wednesday night he called Salvini a \"hero of Europe\" for his crackdown on migration.\n\n\"The immigration we get here from Africa and the Mideast is completely contrary to our culture, our values, our way of life, tolerance, love of women and so on,\" Baudet said. \"That has to stop and it will not happen at the European level.\"\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Freedom, Slavery, Austerity or Nothing at All", "body": "As Europeans go to the polls in a Continental election, a New York Times reporter set out to find out what Europe means to Europeans in 2019.\n\nIn his front yard in Poland, Jaroslaw Kurski flies the European Union flag, blue with a circle of yellow stars, and he carries one during street protests against a nationalist government that has chipped away at his country's young democracy.\n\n\"The European flag has become the symbol of resistance,\" said Mr. Kurski, the deputy editor of Gazeta Wyborcza, a liberal newspaper based in Warsaw.\n\nIn northern France, Guy F\u00fcnfrock and fellow Yellow Vest protesters at a rainy traffic roundabout talk about resistance, too, but defiantly fly the French tricolor. To them, Europe embodies everything they have come to hate: shuttered factories, stagnating wages and a young banker-turned-president who champions deeper integration.\n\n\"This Europe serves big business, not the little people,\" said Mr. F\u00fcnfrock, a retired carpenter.\n\nI met Mr. Kurski and Mr. F\u00fcnfrock on a 10-day journey through the European Union before the Continent votes from Thursday through Sunday for the European Parliament. I wanted to know: What does Europe mean to Europeans today?\n\nThe election has shaped up as a battle for the soul of Europe -- between those who want more Europe and those who would water it down. The decades-old project of unity has rarely been more precarious.\n\nThe European Union has grown in successive waves for different reasons -- democratizing and developing new members, always with the idea that prosperity and shared values would enhance security for all.\n\nToday that expansion has left the bloc laboring under the weight of its own ideals and ambitions.\n\nI retraced its origin story, starting at the French-German border, where it all began after World War II. Then to Italy, the country where the founding treaty was signed by just six members. I ended in the post-Communist east, where Europe's newest members, and many of its poorest, joined after the Cold War, eventually bringing the group to 28.\n\nBy the end, I felt disoriented, and realized many Europeans did, too. \"Freedom,\" a German professor said, when asked what the European Union meant to him. \"Slavery,\" an Italian grandmother said. \"Nothing at all,\" a French electrician said.\n\nBut almost no one wanted their country to leave the European Union, even if almost no one was happy with how it was working.\n\nHope competed with disillusionment, I found. The balance almost invariably depended on opportunity -- whether the idea of Europe had opened doors to prosperity, or let in unwanted threats in the form of new states, new values or new people.\n\nIn the sleepy Tuscan town of Cascina, Italy, I met a Catholic priest who fretted that Europe had lost its way.\n\n\"We're living a big crisis,\" the Rev. Elvis Ragusa, 36, said, sitting in an office next to his small church.\n\nAs a child, he watched an Italian television series called \"Europe Is Us.\" There was also a game show that offered up to 1 million lira to the first person to call in and shout \"Europa, Europa!\" live on air.\n\nIt was the 1990s and Europe meant prosperity. \"I grew up with that idea that Europe was our future,\" Father Ragusa recalled.\n\nBut for a new generation, Europe has become synonymous with austerity and the perils of open borders.\n\nFather Ragusa's town had voted for the left for seven decades. But three years ago, it became the first Tuscan town to switch allegiance to the hard-right, anti-immigrant League party of Matteo Salvini, Europe's most flamboyant populist leader.\n\nThe priest took a small plastic globe off his bookshelf and spun it to show a flagrantly outsized Italian boot protruding from Europe. This is how Italians like to think of Italy today, he said.\n\nNationalism is winning. \"It could be very dangerous,\" he said.\n\nHis words came back to me in Arezzo, Italy, where an engineer recalled his shock when his 16-year-old daughter gave the thumbs up after she heard on the news that a hundred migrants had drowned.\n\n\"Good,\" she had said, \"that's a hundred less coming to Italy.\" Then, seeing her father's face, she added: \"Look, Dad, don't be so shocked, everyone thinks this.\"\n\nA French teacher from Normandy told me how his students started describing immigrants as \"rats\" during the 2015 migrant crisis.\n\nAfter that, he started signing them up for a European exchange program, Erasmus. I met him and his students on the plane to Gdansk, Poland.\n\n\"I thought: What can we do at our level to open these kids up to humanist ideas, to the idea of Europe?\" the teacher, Mathieu Le Parquois, told me. His grandmother had been deported during World War II, but that was ancient history for his students.\n\n\"Not even their grandparents experienced it,\" he said.\n\nThe place where I still found abundant idealism was in Strasbourg, France, on the border with Germany, where people did remember that history.\n\nThere, I met Rita Lemmel, the daughter of a German prisoner of war, who married a French factory worker. Their daughter has both passports, speaks both languages, lives in France and works in Germany. All three dream of a United States of Europe, American-style.\n\n\"We should have a president, and governors in each country,\" said her French husband, Bruno Lemmel.\n\nBut more often, I found that the European Union had become a proxy for big abstract things that people feel threaten their way of life: Migration in Italy. Capitalism in France. Liberal secular values in Poland.\n\nSome were contemplating liberal democracy itself.\n\n\"Is it the best system we have? And for whom?\" asked Wit Nirski, a 36-year-old advertisement strategist I met on the train from Warsaw back to Berlin. \"Is it the best system for growth, is it the best system for people?\"\n\n\"If people were happy,\" he added, \"why would the populists gain?\"\n\nNowhere did the conversations feel as raw as in Poland, where freedom is both recent and fragile.\n\nGdansk -- the city where World War II started; where the Solidarity union that brought down Communism was born; where Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, was born, too -- was still reeling from the fatal stabbing this year of its mayor, Pawel Adamowicz.\n\nHis widow, Magdalena Adamowicz, is running in the European elections after her husband's murder because, as she put it, Europe means \"tolerance.\"\n\nBoth of her grandmothers survived Auschwitz, she told me. \"If you set people against each other, then you can have the same story as before,\" she said. The week before I was with her, Polish state television showed images of Mr. Tusk next to images of Hitler and Stalin.\n\nMr. Kurski, the editor, told me that his paper faces some 30 lawsuits, several from the nationalist government.\n\nThe European Union and the European Court of Justice are important allies, Mr. Kurski said. \"Without the European Union,\" he said, \"Poland would be an authoritarian state.\"\n\nYet in the small Polish town of Swiebodzin, whose claim to fame is a giant statue of Jesus, several people told me that Europe stands for diktat and secularization.\n\n\"The E.U. is dictating conditions to Poland,\" said a local resident named Borzena, 59, as she stepped out from an evening Mass. Gay marriage and gay adoption were not welcome here, she said.\n\nOpposite the church, a nationalist election poster showed the campaign slogan of the governing Law and Justice party: \"Poland is the heart of Europe.\"\n\nPoland's nationalists do not want to take Poland out of the European Union. They want to take the European Union out of Poland.\n\n\"We are Polish and we want to stay Polish,\" Danuta Bialooka-Kostenecka, a local politician in the north, told me.\n\nEverywhere people wanted their own nation \"first.\" Especially in Italy.\n\nI spent a day on the campaign trail with Susanna Ceccardi, a 32-year-old rising star of the League, who says Europe is at risk of being Islamized.\n\nAs mayor of Cascina, she has instructed the police to remove immigrant hawkers, hired private security guards outside schools and handed out pepper spray to Italian women in her town. She was distributing fliers one recent Saturday, promising to fight \"bureaucrats in Brussels.\"\n\nLike on that Tuscan square, where the League was the only party campaigning, in Kehl, a contented western German town where the streets are clean, the cars are big and unemployment is low, the only campaign stall I saw belonged to a far-right party, Alternative for Germany.\n\nIts slogan -- \"Secure the Borders!\" -- made me think of all the times I had crossed borders on this journey, while barely noticing.\n\nI walked across the Rhine, once a front line between France and Germany.\n\nI took the train from Poland back to Germany, crossing the Oder, another river name associated with a front line.\n\nBut where physical borders have melted away, other borders have risen. Borders between cities and countryside, borders between young and old and, above all, between rich and poor.\n\nThose borders have grown taller, said Jeremy Klein, one of the Yellow Vest protesters on the roundabout of Thillois, outside of Reims, France.\n\nAn electrician, Mr. Klein works 60-hour weeks and still struggles. He blames Europe. It was after the former Soviet bloc countries joined the European Union that things got tough in France, he said.\n\n\"We have sold our know-how to Europe and now we are in competition with workers who are paid less than us,\" he said. \"We're just competing with Europe. It is not a fair Europe. I don't feel European at all. I am French, only French.\"\n\nThe Kleins have never voted and do not plan to vote in the European elections. \"What's the point?\" Mr. Klein said.\n\nAfter 10 days on the road, my main takeaway was this: Europe cannot be taken for granted. But neither can its demise.\n\nAs Father Ragusa put it in Tuscany, Europe is a choice Europeans need to make over and over again.\n\nHe spoke of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor who was killed by the Nazis and had written about the role a toxic combination of economic hardship and ethnic hatred played in the rise of fascism. What he had written about Germany during its ascent could have been written today, Father Ragusa said.\n\nThe question Europe ultimately faces is the same, today as always, he said: \"What values do you want to follow?

Leadsom and May were the two finalists in the 2016 contest to become the leader of the Conservative Party and the next British prime minister. Leadsom withdrew from that race after a controversial interview in which she suggested being a mother made her a better pick than May, who doesn't have children.\n\nBut she may be eyeing another run for No. 10. On Tuesday, Leadsom told LBC radio that she was \"actively considering\" and \"preparing\" for a leadership bid.\n\nShe would join a crowd of contenders from the Conservative Party who have indicated in interest in replacing May. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson is currenting leading in opinion polls.\n\nIn her resignation letter, Leadsom said she no longer believed May's approach to Brexit could \"deliver on the referendum result\" or ensure \"a truly sovereign United Kingdom.\"\n\nLeadsom said a second Brexit referendum would be \"dangerously divisive.\" May, too, has opposed a second referendum, but on Tuesday offered Parliament a chance to vote on whether there should be a second public vote.\n\nLeadsom added that tolerance for those in May's top leadership team \"who advocate policies contrary to the government's position had led to a complete breakdown of collective responsibility.\"\n\nA spokesman for Downing Street said May was \"disappointed\" that Leadsom had resigned, but added -- defiantly -- that the prime minister \"remains focused on delivering the Brexit people voted for.\"\n\nThere was much commotion on Wednesday over the possibility that May could be pushed out by lawmakers in her own party.\n\nOn Tuesday, May delivered what was potentially her last big sales pitch for her Brexit plan, urging lawmakers to pass a deal they've already rejected three times. May offered a few new tweaks, including the enticement of a vote on a second referendum. It went down like a lead balloon.\n\nConservative lawmakers, previously loyal, were suddenly popping up on telly or in newspapers saying that she had to go.\n\nTom Tugendhat, a Conservative lawmaker and chair of the foreign affairs committee, wrote in the Financial Times on Wednesday that \"leadership matters; it has been absent for too long.\" He said that May \"deserves respect\" but that a new leader was needed to \"inject fresh energy into a moribund process and rebuild the trust necessary to deliver a deal.\"\n\nBut May appeared to win a stay of execution, for a few days at least.\n\nRead more\n\nTheresa May offers Parliament a vote on a second Brexit referendum\n\nIn what may be Britain's last European election, Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party is expected to dominate\n\nChelsea Flower Show wows with a royal treehouse and climate change garden", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6XXX_klX-mEGtK6WWpILsSU1GZI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CHFNTXT42EI6TJNTGTZ634JVDY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4803960", "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 296254200}, {"uri": "1142849139", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "16:51:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T16:51:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5215686559677124, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/europe/brexit-theresa-may.html", "title": "Theresa May Faces Growing Calls to Quit Amid Fresh Brexit Revolt", "body": "With Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain facing yet another defeat in Parliament over her Brexit plans, her governing Conservative Party is now confronting a dilemma: Should they allow their wounded pilot to go down in flames or should they press the ejector button first?\n\nEither way, Mrs. May's turbulent time in Downing Street is entering its final stages by her own admission, wrecked by her failure to persuade Parliament to support her deal to leave the European Union.\n\nAs the Wednesday wore on, rumors swirled with increasing intensity of a cabinet revolt against Mrs. May, the day after her latest plan to resolve Brexit provoked a ferocious backlash from her own lawmakers.\n\nWith her leadership already on life support, Mrs. May's latest Brexit proposal, announced on Tuesday, was seen as her last chance to salvage some sort of legacy from her time in power by persuading Parliament to accept a variant on a blueprint it has already rejected three times.\n\nBut so negative was the reaction to her proposal that some lawmakers believe that putting it up for a vote would make matters worse, not better, because another crushing defeat would complicate life for her successor. Nigel Evans, a member of an influential committee of Conservative lawmakers, said that Mrs. May should \"make way for fresh leadership without handcuffing her successor to a poisoned baton.\"\n\nThroughout Wednesday, pressure mounted on Mrs. May to scrap the vote that she is still promising for the week beginning June 3, and to name the date of her departure immediately.\n\nMrs. May's ability to dig deep and survive any amount of political pain has been perhaps the defining feature of her period in power. On Wednesday, she defended her Brexit blueprint doggedly in Parliament as she has done so often before, even as she conceded that \"in time another prime minister will be standing at this dispatch box.\"\n\nBut the support a prime minister would normally expect was conspicuously absent, with many of Mrs. May's fellow Conservatives staying away from the chamber and leaving her to fend for herself. All the while around Parliament, an expanding crowd of hopefuls are lobbying Conservative lawmakers for support in the looming contest for her job.\n\nIn one last desperate act, Mrs. May has revamped a proposal that would keep Britain tied to Europe's main economic structures at least until the end of 2020, then take it out of the bloc's customs and trading system.\n\nBut constructing a revised deal that might gain the support of a wider coalition of lawmakers, including some from the opposition Labour Party, has put Mrs. May on a political tightrope.\n\nWith her revamped plan, Mrs. May aimed to win over Labour lawmakers by offering the opportunity to vote on whether to put any plan for Brexit to a second referendum. Lawmakers would also be allowed to vote on whether to keep Britain, temporarily, in a type of customs union with the European Union that would eliminate tariffs and many checks on goods at borders.\n\nBut while the Labour leadership rejected the concessions as insufficient, many of Mrs. May's pro-Brexit lawmakers were horrified, and several of those who had reluctantly supported the government in its last Brexit vote have said they would not do so again.\n\nAnother defeat would be particularly problematic since Mrs. May is not offering lawmakers a general vote on her deal but one on specific legislation to take Britain out of the bloc. Losing that would limit the options for a new prime minister, who would not be able to bring back the bill in the same parliamentary session.\n\nOn Wednesday, one Conservative lawmaker, Nicky Morgan, appealed to Mrs. May to reflect on whether to proceed with her Brexit vote, noting that the \"consequences of it not being passed are very serious.\"\n\nEarlier, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, gave an agile and evasive interview to the BBC in which he hinted that the bill might not come forward as planned -- without saying whether it would.\n\nThat question is connected to the timing of Mrs. May's departure.\n\nEarlier this year she promised to step down if lawmakers voted for her deal. Then, last week, she told senior Conservative lawmakers that, if her proposal was rejected again, she would set out a timetable for her successor to be chosen.\n\nConvincing her to withdraw the proposal would be an effective admission that she cannot win, and would seem to fulfill that condition -- giving lawmakers a way to send her packing without shouldering direct responsibility.\n\nThough Mrs. May now has only threadbare support -- at best -- from her cabinet, senior colleagues are divided into factions depending on their willingness to contemplate the huge economic risks of withdrawing from the European Union unilaterally. With little trust among them, cabinet ministers have struggled to maneuver against Mrs. May, and levering her out of Downing Street quickly is also complicated by the upcoming political calendar.\n\nLate on Sunday results will start coming in from European elections, in which opinion polls suggest the Conservatives will be humiliated. That would put Mrs. May under pressure to resign immediately. But Monday is a public holiday, and Parliament will be on vacation until June 4, when President Trump is scheduled to be in Britain on his state visit.\n\nIf she can survive this week, Mrs. May is likely to be able to continue until after the visit. But sooner or later, the time will come for her to lay down a timetable for the election of the next leader of the Conservative Party.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_castle@nytimes.com", "name": "Stephen Castle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/22/world/22brexit2/22brexit2-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4803960", "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 296239860}, {"uri": "1142795833", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "15:42:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T15:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/business/cars-brexit-europe-technology.html", "title": "What's Driving Automakers Out of Europe?", "body": "Blame has been cast on events like Brexit, but there are other changes that are reshaping the industry globally.\n\nAutomakers, in quick succession, have moved in recent weeks to end parts of their operations in Europe. Nissan is the latest: On Tuesday, it confirmed that it would cease assembling Infiniti cars at its plant in northeast England.\n\nThe moves, during Britain's wrenching debate over its departure from the European Union, known as Brexit, have raised the question: Is Brexit forcing the carmaking industry out of Britain?\n\nIt's not quite so simple. Traditional car manufacturers, in Britain and in Europe over all, have been buffeted by forces around the world, and they assess where they want to make the next model of a car every few years or so.\n\nAs automakers allocate resources, they have been balancing the need to respond to these changes with the justifications for producing cars in places like Britain.\n\nHere are some of the forces reshaping the industry.\n\nWho is moving?\n\nHonda said it would close its plant in Swindon, England, by 2021 and stop making one of its sedans in Turkey. The Swindon plant employs 3,500 and the Turkish plant about 1,100.\n\nNissan reversed an earlier decision by deciding to produce the next generation of its X-Trail sport utility vehicle in Japan instead of Sunderland, England. Its luxury brand, Infiniti, is withdrawing from Western Europe altogether.\n\nFord said in January that it would cut thousands of jobs across Europe.\n\nJaguar Land Rover announced in January that it would be cutting 4,500 people from its global work force; most of the cuts are expected to be in Britain.\n\nDyson, which is developing an electric car, moved its headquarters from Britain to Singapore the same month.\n\nGeneral Motors pulled out of Europe in 2017, selling the Opel and Vauxhall brands.\n\nRegulation of fossil fuels has tightened\n\nIn the wake of Volkswagen's diesel-cheating scandal in 2015, when it used software to trick emissions tests, awareness of the harmful effects of fossil fuels has prompted stricter regulation throughout the Continent.\n\nSome German cities are banning older diesel engines in an effort to reduce pollution in urban areas. London has initiated a levy on drivers of older diesel vehicles. Britain and France plan to phase out sales of new diesel and gasoline-powered cars by 2040.\n\nHow Volkswagen's 'Defeat Devices' Worked\n\nVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.\n\nIn the meantime, more governments, drivers and carmakers are pivoting to electric vehicles. Cars running on alternative fuels made up 6 percent of new car registrations last year in Europe, up from 4.8 percent in 2017, according to JATO, an auto industry research firm.\n\nNorway is aiming to sell only electric cars by 2025, while India is aiming to be all electric by 2030.\n\nCarmakers are racing to respond. Volkswagen said Tuesday that it intended to sell 22 million electric cars over the next 10 years, compared with its previous goal of 15 million, and that the company would aim to be carbon neutral by 2050.\n\nThe investments necessary for building electric cars have added to cost pressures for automakers that, in some cases, have struggled to turn a profit in Europe.\n\nIn justifying the closing of its Swindon factory, Honda said it wanted to focus on electrification. \"The significant challenges of electrification will see Honda revise its global manufacturing operations, and focus activity in regions where it expects to have high production volumes,\" the company said.\n\nChina is speeding ahead on electric cars\n\nAs carmakers channel billions of dollars into grabbing a portion of the electric car market, many are looking to China, which is the world's largest maker and seller of electric cars.\n\nChina wants one in every five cars sold to run on an alternative fuel by 2025, and officials have said the country will get rid of internal combustion engines in new cars altogether. The country's rules also require carmakers to sell more alternative-energy cars if they want to continue selling regular models.\n\nThis has prompted car companies to realign where they make and develop cars.\n\nTesla has opened a factory there. Volkswagen signed an agreement with the Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group last year to develop an electric vehicle. General Motors has made China the hub of its electric car research and development, while both Renault-Nissan and Ford have joint electric-car ventures in China.\n\nThe industry is getting more crowded\n\nIn their efforts to grab a share of the growing market for electric cars, traditional car companies are competing not just with each other but also against technology companies.\n\nUber, Alphabet and Tesla are channeling money into electric cars and autonomous cars, while reshaping the way people travel with ride-hailing services.\n\nThis has prompted rivals to team up, or to work with the technology companies, so that they are not left behind.\n\nFord and Volkswagen formed an alliance in January to share technology for electric and self-driving vehicles, and save money.\n\nBMW and Daimler announced in February that they would collectively invest 1 billion euros in a joint venture focused on offering services like car-sharing and electric charging points.\n\nAudi, BMW and Daimler have joined forces to buy a digital mapping company. Daimler has teamed up with Uber on autonomous vehicles.\n\nBMW is working with the chip maker Intel and Mobileye, an Israeli tech company, to develop a self-driving car. It is also in a partnership with IBM to use artificial intelligence to adapt vehicles to owners' preferences.\n\nFiat Chrysler is working with Google on self-driving cars, General Motors invested $500 million into Lyft, and Volvo provided the chassis for Uber's driverless car tests.\n\nThis shift has accelerated change and added to costs, said Peter Wells, a professor at the Center for Automotive Industry Research at the Cardiff Business School in Wales. And that has prompted companies to scrutinize whether they should maintain operations in markets that are not expected to grow and could become more difficult to serve.\n\n\"Companies around the world are having to re-evaluate their positions,\" Mr. Wells said.\n\nEuropean markets are sluggish\n\nThe European car market is not growing. Annual car sales there peaked in 2007 at about 16 million. They're at about 15 million now, according to JATO.\n\nIt is also a saturated market, dominated by European marques, and favors smaller cars. Carmakers hungry for profits generated by pickup trucks and S.U.V.s are looking elsewhere for growth. Sales of S.U.V.s in Europe are still far behind those in China and the United States.\n\nThe Italian-American company Fiat Chrysler said in February that it planned to expand its capacity in the United States by updating several plants. They will produce large Jeep models.\n\nCertainly, even promising regions face challenges. In the United States, many believe that car sales have peaked, forcing the idling of some factories. And the economic slowdown in China has sent car sales plummeting.\n\nBut in announcing its withdrawal from Western Europe, Infiniti said it intended to focus on its S.U.V. in North America and its new models in China.\n\nBrexit makes planning harder\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the uncertainty surrounding Britain's departure from the European Union has made it difficult for companies to plan ahead. Several car companies have said they will close their factories temporarily after the country leaves the bloc in order to adjust to the disruptions that could arise.\n\nThe fear is that Brexit could cause havoc with the carefully choreographed just-in-time production processes at assembly plants. In Britain, more than half of the components in cars come from the European Union, entering seamlessly on trucks from the Continent and arriving within minutes of being fitted in the final product.\n\nAfter Brexit, those trucks could face substantial delays if they must go through customs checkpoints. Without a clear sense of the terms of Britain's scheduled departure in a couple of weeks, making plans for production a few years down the line is more difficult. Investment into Britain's auto industry fell by half last year.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amie_tsang@nytimes.com", "name": "Amie Tsang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/15/business/0015carsexplain1-print/00carsexplain1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4802222", "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 296235720}, {"uri": "1142445290", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "11:46:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T11:46:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-finance-202/2019/05/22/the-finance-202-former-fed-heavyweight-blasts-trump-era-financial-deregulation/5ce44f4c1ad2e52231e8e74b/", "title": "Analysis | The Finance 202: Former Fed heavyweight blasts Trump-era financial deregulation", "body": "President Barack Obama's financial regulatory czar is ringing the alarm over his successors' push to roll back post-crisis restrictions on big banks, moves he says could exacerbate the next major meltdown.\n\nDaniel Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor who spent eight years following the 2008-2009 crisis rewriting the Wall Street rule book, in a Monday speech denounced what he called the Trump era's \"low-intensity deregulation\" of the financial industry. He defined the phenomenon as a pileup of small tweaks to the existing regime, all ignored by the public, that taken together will undermine a system intended to prevent another devastating recession. After the current regulators have \"moved on,\" he said, \"somewhere down the line, someone else will suffer that damage. In all likelihood, it will once again be the most vulnerable of households and businesses.\"\n\nThe speech, delivered at Americans for Financial Reform in Washington, amounted to a rare rebuke of Tarullo's successors from the man the Wall Street Journal once called \"the most powerful man in banking,\" and Wall Streeters themselves nicknamed \"the Wizard of Oz\" for his quiet power over their industry. (Read the speech here.)\n\nAnd it comes a week after two former Fed chairs and two former Treasury secretaries sounded a warning about how Trump's Wall Street watchdogs are minding their beat. In a letter last Monday, the former Fed chairs, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, and the former treasury chiefs, Tim Geithner and Jack Lew, criticized the decision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to stop subjecting to extra oversight non-banks including major insurers and asset managers. \"Though framed as procedural changes, these amendments amount to a substantial weakening of the post-crisis reforms,\" they wrote.\n\n\"What's most notable here is just that all of these regulators collectively think that now is the time to speak out,\" says Jeremy Kress, an assistant professor of business law at the University of Michigan and a crisis-era attorney at the Fed. \"Between what's going on at the Fed and FSOC, all the crisis-era regulators have had enough. And while they've generally maintained a low profile since leaving office, they've decided to put their personas behind substantive and serious critiques of these deregulatory proposals.\"\n\nTarullo focused in particular on stress testing, the exercise designed to determine whether banks have enough reserve capital to survive an economic collapse. He said the tests offer too many advance clues to banks, a change made in the name of transparency that will in fact allow banks to \"find clever ways to reshape their assets\" so they can maintain lower levels of capital without actually trimming risk. Tarullo also said a Fed proposal to create a new \"stress capital buffer\" to prevent banks from depleting their capital cushion with dividend payments could allow them to take on more risk, since it would exclude one of two standards used to calculate a bank's exposure.\n\nKevin Fromer, president of the Financial Services Forum, which represents CEOs of eight of the largest banks, suggested Tarullo's concerns are unfounded, because the biggest firms have more than an adequate capital cushion. \"I don't think there's any question the overall level of capital in these institutions is obviously higher, and the stress tests have demonstrated repeatedly that these institutions are extremely well capitalized and capable of lending in an extreme economic downturn,\" he said.\n\nBut Marcus Stanley, policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, which advocates tougher regulation of the industry, said Tarullo's critique highlighted how changes to the stress tests raise doubts about their reliability to ensure banks remain sound. \"For someone who is the architect of this system to come out publicly and say this isn't fine-tuning, and it's undermining the system, is quite significant,\" he said.\n\nIan Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, says the former regulators worked long and hard on the post-crisis rules, so it's \"understandable\" they now want to be on record opposing efforts to dial them back. Plus, Katz notes the industry appears to be gaining some traction on Capitol Hill: In the House, 26 Republicans recently wrote financial regulators pushing for more deregulation.\n\nYet he said his conversations with investors in the industry indicate they are more concerned with those firms outside the scope of strict federal oversight.\n\n\"I've had discussions with people who believe that the regulators, particularly the Fed, are still paying close attention to things like leveraged lending. But in the markets, to the extent people are concerned, they're more concerned about whats going on outside the regulated banking sector.\"\n\n-- Theresa May: Let Parliament vote on second Brexit referendum. The Post's Karla Adams: \"British Prime Minister Theresa May urged British lawmakers on Tuesday to back her 'new' Brexit deal, which would include a binding vote by Parliament on whether to hold a second Brexit referendum. In a speech in London, May said lawmakers will have \"one last chance\" to deliver Brexit in a vote early next month. But, more accurately, it probably will be May's last chance. She has signaled that she will step down if her thrice-rejected divorce deal fails again in the House of Commons, as it is widely expected to do.\"\n\nThe speech got panned. Per The Guardian: \"The Labour leadership insisted it did not represent a meaningful change and hard Brexit-supporting Tories and the DUP indicated they had little or no intention of voting for it. The People's Vote campaign also dismissed May's offer of a vote on a second referendum.\n\n-- Trump team eyes Fed critic Judy Shelton. WSJ's Nick Timiraos: \"Economist Judy Shelton, a potential nominee to the Federal Reserve, said in an interview that she would bring a different perspective to the central bank and press for a change in how it sets interest rates. Ms. Shelton has been interviewed by White House officials for a nomination to the Fed's board of governors and served as an informal adviser to [Trump's] 2016 campaign. She wrote critically in the weeks before that election about how the Fed's low- rate policies were boosting wealthy investors and corporations at the expense of working Americans and retirees with fixed incomes. On Tuesday, Ms. Shelton said she is no longer concerned about such perils because she believes the administration's fiscal policies have boosted growth and productivity.\"\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\n-- Xi speaks in subtext: Chinese President Xi Jinping didn't mention his country's trade war on Tuesday, but his actions show that he is ready for the long haul.\n\nPerspective: Rare earth materials may not be such a trump card. CNN's James Griffiths explains: \"Despite their name, rare earths are not that rare... Unlike oil and other raw materials, the need for a large and constant supply of many rare earth materials is also less important. Many products which use rare earths only require tiny amounts -- they have been described as 'the vitamins of modern technology' -- and therefore it will take time for them to be impacted by tariffs. The US also maintains stockpiles of many key rare earth materials, not least those used in the defense industry.\"\n\n-- The Trump administration targeted Huawei after China talks went south. \"The Trump administration held off on blacklisting Huawei Technologies Co. out of concern the move could disrupt trade negotiations with China and only took action after the last round of talks hit an impasse, according to people familiar with the matter,\" Bloomberg's Jenny Leonard, Nick Wadhams, and Margaret Talev report.\n\n\"Timing of the U.S. action raised questions about whether [Trump] is punishing the company in part to gain a negotiating edge with Beijing in a deepening clash over trade. Talks between Beijing and Washington deadlocked this month as Trump accused China of backing out of a deal that was taking shape with U.S. officials, saying China reneged on an agreement to enshrine a wide range of reforms in law.\"\n\nFive more companies to the blacklist? Bloomberg's Jenny Leonard and Nick Wadhams: \"The U.S. is considering cutting off the flow of vital American technology to as many as five Chinese companies including Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co., widening the dragnet beyond Huawei to include world leaders in video surveillance. The U.S. is deliberating whether to add Hikvision, Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. and several unidentified others to a blacklist that bars them from U.S. components or software, people familiar with the matter said.\"\n\n-- Walmart workers invite Bernie Sanders to company's annual meeting: \"For years, Walmart workers have attended the company's annual shareholders meeting to call for higher wages, better benefits and more predictable schedules,\" my colleague Abha Bhattarai reports. \"This year they'll have someone new delivering the message on their behalf: Sen. Bernie Sanders.\"\n\n\"The presidential candidate, who has repeatedly called on Walmart to improve its working conditions, is heading to Bentonville, Ark., on June 5 to introduce a shareholders' proposal that would give hourly Walmart workers a seat on the company's board.\"\n\n-- BMW CEO's future in jeopardy: \"BMW AG Chief Executive Officer Harald Krueger's job is hanging in the balance as the luxury carmaker steers through a fundamental shift toward electric and autonomous vehicles as well as weakening markets, people familiar with the discussions said,\" Bloomberg News's Elisabeth Behrmann and Oliver Sachgau report.\n\n\"Some supervisory board members are raising questions over whether he's the right choice to lead the company and will discuss the CEO's second-term prospects in the coming weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential deliberations.

As the European Union gears up for a crucial election, it is mostly homegrown groups rather than foreign powers that are taking to social media to push false information and extremist messages, experts say.\n\nAnd private and encrypted chat apps like WhatsApp are increasingly the favored platforms to spread false information, making it harder to monitor and fight.\n\nThere were worries that the bloc's May 23-26 vote for the EU parliament would be a ripe target for foreign meddling, given Russian interference in the 2016 ballot that brought U.S. President Donald Trump to power and allegations of disinformation -- plus a lack of solid facts -- surrounding Britain's Brexit referendum that same year.\n\nSo far, no spike has appeared on the 28-nation bloc's disinformation radars and tech companies say they haven't found signs of a coordinated operation by foreign actors. There is, though, a constant buzz of false information that mainly seeks to erode the EU's image and that has ground on since the last Europe-wide elections in 2014.\n\n\"Previous, it was broadly about Russia, fakery and looking for bots. Now what we see is the transnational Far Right deploying that digital toolkit, less fake news, more hate-speech, and a more complex set of tactics to amplify populist narratives,\" said Sasha Havlicek, CEO of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based left leaning think tank. \"That isn't to say that is there is no Russian activity but that it's harder to identify definitively.\"\n\nThe trend now is for populist and far right groups in Europe to \"manipulate information\" through more nuanced messages, to promote anti-migration, anti-gay and climate denial themes. This \"narrative warfare\" is much harder for governments and tech companies to react to, she said. Adding to the confusion, some world leaders have themselves been guilty of spreading false or misleading information on social media.\n\nOnline campaign group Avaaz said Wednesday it found 500 suspect Facebook pages and groups in Germany, Britain, France, Spain, Italy and Poland spreading fake news seen 533 million times in the past three months. Facebook has taken down 77 of the pages, some of which Avaaz had previously announced.\n\nOne of the pages taken down, supporting Italy's right-wing League party, had shared a video purporting to show African migrants smashing a police car that had racked up 10 million views. But it was actually a scene from a film and had been already debunked several times over the years, Avaaz said.\n\nChristoph Schott, campaign director at Avaaz, says that fake news is often amplified with \"bait and switch\" tactics like building up an audience for a page on a generic topic such as football or cooking, then ramping up political agendas.\n\nThe aim is to sow \"little seeds of distrust ... to slowly erode trust in institutions and divide people over a longer period of time,\" said Schott.\n\nFacebook said that after Avaaz shared its research, it removed a number of fake and duplicate accounts for violating its \"authenticity policies\" and took action against some pages that repeatedly posted misinformation.\n\nTech companies have stepped up broader efforts to fight fake news.\n\nFacebook has set up an EU election \"war room\" in Dublin, staffed by data scientists, researchers and threat intelligence specialists working with teams in California to monitor for abuse around the clock.\n\nFacebook's vice president for public policy in Europe, Richard Allan, said this month the company hasn't detected any major attacks.\n\n\"Part of that, we hope, is because we put in a lot of preventive measures,\" he said. \"We've gotten better at fake account detection and removal.\"\n\nTwitter, which launched a tool for EU users to report deliberately misleading election-related content, also says it hasn't seen any coordinated malicious activity.\n\nThe two social media companies, along with Google, have tightened up requirements for taking out political ads, including confirming identities of ad buyers. They're putting all political ads into publicly searchable databases, although researchers say they don't give a comprehensive view and the ads aren't always properly classified.\n\nThe nature of European elections may be a factor in behind why they haven't been targeted. For one thing, turnout is usually low. Around 42 percent of voters cast their ballots in 2014. Beyond that, Europe's citizens often use the EU elections to cast protest votes about issues of domestic concern.\n\nAround 400 million people in 28 countries are eligible to vote in the world's biggest transnational elections, choosing 751 representatives to the European Parliament, the EU's only democratically elected institution.\n\n\"The European elections are still basically 28 different national campaigns, fought mostly on national issues,\" said policy analyst Paul Butcher at the European Policy Centre think-tank. \"Each country has got its own political priorities; the campaigns will be quite different in different places.\"\n\nBut it could also be a matter of not looking in the right place. Oxford University researchers studying tweets related to the EU elections found that only a small fraction came from Russian or \"junk news\" sources while mainstream news stories dominated.\n\nHowever, some junk news stories can be several times more popular than those from professional media organizations, with the most successful centered on populist themes such as anti-immigration and Islamophobia while few attacked European leaders and parties or voiced skepticism about the EU, according to the researchers, who compiled about 585,000 tweets in seven European languages.\n\n\"Almost none of the junk we found circulating online came from known Russian sources,\" said Nahema Marchal, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. \"Instead, it is homegrown, hyper-partisan and alternative media that dominate.\"\n\nIt's also become harder to keep track of disinformation as more online conversations go private, said Clara Jim\u00e9nez Cruz, co-founder of Spanish fact-checking group Maldita.es.\n\nTwitter posts or public Facebook feeds are only part of the story, with many messages and discussions now moving to private Facebook groups or encrypted WhatsApp and Telegram chats, which EU and national governments can't easily monitor, she said.\n\nAvaaz said in a report that millions of potential Spanish voters were flooded with false, misleading, racist or hateful posts on WhatsApp ahead of national elections last month.\n\nOn WhatsApp, where it's so hard for outsiders to peer into private conversations to debunk lies, \"that is where we find most of the hoaxes,\" said Jim\u00e9nez. \"And especially where we find them first.\"\n\n___\n\nCook reported from Brussels and Parra reported from Madrid.

That's a bad sign for free trade.\n\nThe birds are being used in a food fight by populists in Europe who are poised to make significant gains in parliamentary elections this week. Such a shift in the makeup of the European Parliament would complicate the simmering trade conflict between the United States and Europe.\n\nChicken meat from the United States is routinely sterilized using a chlorinated wash, a method forbidden in the European Union. The American birds are banned and often cited, with some dread, as an all-purpose justification for putting up barriers to American products.\n\nThe Trump administration has tried to put the chickens back on the negotiating table, notably with Britain as it prepares to leave the European Union. European candidates, both on the left and on the right, have seized the cluckers as a way to dramatize the stakes in the balloting that runs from Thursday to Sunday.\n\nAmong the first candidates to bring up chickens was Yanis Varoufakis, a left-wing former finance minister of Greece who is running for a seat in Brussels. During an appearance in March, Mr. Varoufakis vowed to block multinational corporations that \"will want to introduce chlorinated chickens in Europe.\"\n\nMatteo Salvini, the leader of Italy's right-wing League party, did not directly mention the birds but invoked food anxiety last week, on the eve of a rally of 11 populist leaders from across Europe. \"In some agricultural sectors, I think of meat; for example, we ask for absolute rigor in the checking of the quality of the production and of the product,\" said Mr. Salvini, who is deputy prime minister and interior minister.\n\nFood accounts for less than 3 percent of the $1.3 trillion in trade between the United States and Europe, far behind products like chemicals, pharmaceuticals, vehicles or machinery. But farmers are among the most powerful political lobbies on both sides of the Atlantic, and trade is one area where the European Parliament wields significant power.\n\nPopulist parties like Mr. Varoufakis's Pan-European DiEM25 or the right-wing coalition led by Mr. Salvini are expected to win enough support to deny the two main centrist parties a majority in the European Parliament, according to estimates by Teneo, a management consultant. The centrist parties -- the conservative European People's Party and the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats -- would have to cooperate with parties like the Greens, who are skeptical of trade deals with the United States.\n\n\"The rightist parties will play a bigger role. The Greens will play a bigger role,\" said Peter Balas, a former Hungarian diplomat who is a senior policy adviser at Covington, a law firm. \"It will be much more difficult in the Parliament to have a cohesive approach to trade.\"\n\nFood may be the least of their problems.\n\nEuropean manufacturers have been on edge for months only to see President Trump put off a decision on imposing tariffs on cars imported from Europe, Japan and South Korea. The delay, for six months, averted a sharp escalation of trade tensions. It brought some relief to European leaders who feared the effect of car tariffs on wobbly economies.\n\nBut six months is not a long time to negotiate a trade deal. Mr. Trump, who has often accused Europe of taking advantage of the United States, could easily revive the threat of car tariffs if he believes the Europeans are refusing to make concessions.\n\nEuropean and American negotiators have continued to meet behind the scenes even as China has attracted most of the attention. On Wednesday, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the European trade commissioner, and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, were scheduled to meet in Paris, where both were attending meetings of members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \"The E.U. is ready to start negotiations for a limited trade agreement,\" a European Commission spokeswoman said.\n\nThe European Commission has limited room to maneuver. In April, France and Belgium balked at joining the talks because the Trump administration refused, in 2017, to sign a global pact on climate change. All 28 European Union states agreed that agriculture products should not be reconsidered, and Congress may not approve a deal that does not help American farmers.\n\nAt campaign stops, candidates are trying to rally emotions and votes around food. Their speechifying takes some skill because that trade is lopsided in favor of Europe. The European Union sold $10.4 billion more goods like wine and cheese to the United States last year than it bought.\n\nFor example, Wisconsin cheese producers are not allowed to sell their Parmesan or feta in Europe. The names are restricted for use from regions in Italy and Greece that traditionally produce them.\n\n\"Europeans can sell their Asiago, Parmesan, feta, etc., in Wisconsin, but cheesemakers like me are blocked from selling Wisconsin cheeses by the same names in Europe,\" Errico Auricchio, president of BelGioioso Cheese, said this month. Mr. Auricchio heads the Consortium for Common Food Names, a lobbying alliance that has asked Mr. Trump to ban imports of food products that Americans cannot sell in Europe.\n\nMost parties in the race for Brussels say they favor free trade but outline conditions -- such as fighting climate change -- that run counter to White House policies.\n\nRight-wing politicians do not have a unified position on trade, but there is a strong protectionist faction. At the populist rally in Milan on Saturday, Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Rally party of France, drew applause with her call: \"We reject uncontrolled free trade that helps only the banks and financiers.\" Ms. Le Pen has routinely equated food with national identity and has promised to protect farmers.\n\nIn a campaign appearance this month, Mr. Salvini spoke about foreign food with the derisive tone he uses to denigrate immigrants.\n\n\"If you give us a hand choosing the League in the European elections on May 26,\" he said, \"we will go to Brussels and bring back Italian farming, which has been massacred in recent years by Canadian grain, Cambodian rice, Moroccan tomatoes, Tunisian oranges, olive oil from the other part of the world.\"\n\nChlorinated chickens have been a sore point since the 1960s. When Europe banned American chickens at the time, the United States retaliated by imposing 25 percent tariffs on European trucks and vans. The European Union food safety agency has concluded that a widely used method for treating chickens with a chloride solution poses \"no safety concerns for humans.\" But the ban on American poultry is still in place, as are truck tariffs, an indication of how intractable trade disputes can be.\n\nThe United States and Europe have fewer problems with each other than each has with China. The United States' trade deficit with Europe is less than one-third that of its deficit with China, even though total trade is much larger. Trade with China totaled $737 billion in 2018, compared with $1.3 trillion with Europe. But the United States had a $379 billion trade deficit with China, compared with a $109 billion deficit with Europe.\n\nThe United States has not accused Europe of wholesale theft of intellectual property, as it has China. Europe does not force American investors to work with local joint venture partners, as China does with any foreign entity. European companies are not accused of hollowing out the American industrial heartland, as is the case with Chinese competitors.\n\nStill, expectations are low. There is some hope that the United States and Europe can work out agreements in pharmaceuticals, a category worth almost $100 billion in two-way trade, far more than food. Most business groups are simply hoping relations do not deteriorate.\n\n\"What we want at the moment is to maintain the status quo,\" said Luisa Santos, director for international relations at BusinessEurope, a leading business group.\n\nOne thing seems certain.\n\n\"Les poulets au chlore ne passeront pas,\" the French weekly Lib\u00e9ration wrote this year in an editorial, albeit with a heavy dose of irony. \"The chlorinated chickens shall not pass.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_ewing@nytimes.com", "name": "Jack Ewing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/20/business/00euvotetrade-1/00euvotetrade-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 296217180}, {"uri": "1142300488", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "10:12:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T10:12:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/05/22/globalism-is-under-siege-heres-how-save-it-why/", "title": "Perspective | Globalism is under siege.

(Lisi Niesner/Reuters) By JoAnne Yates and Craig N. Murphy May 22 at 6:00 AM\n\nOver the past few years, world politics have been governed by a backlash against globalization. From the Brexit mess in Britain to restrictive immigration policies and tariffs in the United States and elsewhere, global economic integration is under assault.\n\nBut such integration offers many benefits: a greater variety of less expensive goods, greater opportunities for travel and cultural exchange, a more cosmopolitan world. In this climate, nongovernmental entities may be crucial to preserving them.\n\nThankfully, engineers have spent the past century building just such international bodies, because they believed that economic integration must remain above politics. These organizations have long set voluntary standards to ensure integration even when the political winds blow against them. This conception of global business standards will be crucial in the years to come as we struggle to preserve the benefits of cohesive systems for international trade, even as politicians battle over how interconnected they want to be.\n\nIt is ironic that the British should find themselves in the Brexit mess, because it was British engineers who created the first of the national standards bodies. Their project, a forerunner of today's British Standards Institution (BSI), was a product of the expansive British Empire. It was founded in 1901 to ensure that industrial products and transportation networks within the United Kingdom and across its empire would be compatible with one another. Although some government representatives were included in its processes, the engineers leading the effort believed such standards should be voluntary, not government-mandated.\n\nAs such, they needed to build buy-in from companies through persuasion, not coercion. They established technical committees of experts representing both producers and users of a particular product -- such as steel companies and railroads on committees to discuss steel rails for railroad tracks -- as well as engineers unaffiliated with either side to represent the common interest. This balance prevented any one set of stakeholders from dominating the process and, while time-consuming, assured that all positions were heard and considered so the resulting standards would be widely adopted.\n\nThe British model was copied by other national bodies in subsequent decades, thanks in part to the evangelism of Charles le Maistre, the long-serving secretary of BSI. Le Maistre successfully encouraged engineers in France, the United States, the Soviet Union, Sweden and a half-dozen other countries to follow the British example.\n\nBut national standard bodies weren't enough for British electrical engineers and industrialists, including le Maistre. They also promoted the first private, sector-based international standards organization, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), created in 1906 and still active today. IEC's standards expanded the market for electrical products and system components such as turbines and transformers by assuring compatibility and lowering prices (since standardized items can be made in larger, cost-saving batches). This made it possible to establish Europe's high-voltage electrical grid.\n\nLe Maistre would serve as secretary of this organization for close to a half-century. Late in his life, he also helped found the post-World War II global standard-setting body, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n\nIEC and ISO have been the center of a global network ever since. In the aftermath of World War II, the vision of the activists in the international community of standard setters, and their belief that such standards were too important to be distorted by politics, allowed these organizations to navigate the minefield of the war's victors and vanquished, as well as the divisive politics of the nascent Cold War.\n\nAlthough standard setters from the victorious countries and some of the neutrals originally formed ISO, le Maistre and other leaders used personal diplomacy to bring the defeated countries into the organization, several years before they were accepted into the United Nations. They also worked hard to keep the Soviet Union and other Eastern bloc countries in the international standards bodies throughout the Cold War.\n\nDuring the postwar decades, a regional standards organization also arose in Europe. Olle Sturen, a Swedish engineer and standard setter, worried that the new European Economic Community, from which the European Union (E.U.) grew, would exclude Swedish industrial products from the lucrative markets of Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium. As a result, Sturen worked with British and German engineers to create a private industrial standardization body for all of Europe: CEN.\n\nThe European Economic Community would maintain tariffs on some goods from Sweden, the United Kingdom and other countries outside the agreement, but CEN assured that across the continent, industrial products, along with the increasingly complex transportation systems that moved goods from one country to the next, would be technically compatible, eliminating many nontariff barriers to trade. These technical committees worked for years to reach consensus on everything from the size and shape of screws to the characteristics of shipping pallets and truck bodies. The standards they developed were voluntary, but they were usually widely adopted simply because all the key stakeholders had been at the table.\n\nWhen Sturen became secretary general of ISO in the late 1960s, a position he held through the mid-1980s, he pursued two major goals: speeding up the establishment of international standards and expanding the standards community worldwide. One of his priorities was setting global standards for intermodal shipping containers, which helped transform global trade. Those big metal boxes stacked up on the world's largest ships, then transferred to railroad cars or trucks to reach their final destinations, bring us most consumer goods and make possible today's global supply chains.\n\nSome economists believe that the cost savings generated by container standardization have had more impact on the massive increase in global trade than anything the World Trade Organization (WTO) has done. Sturen's other early priorities -- standards for connecting computers and for dealing with atmospheric pollution -- have also had a significant impact on global economic integration.\n\nTo expand the world standards community, Sturen encouraged formation of national standards bodies in developing countries so they could join in international standard setting. His efforts reflected a fervent belief that standard-setting must transcend politics -- whether around Brexit, the WTO or other national or international political issues -- and that it is just as important. This could prove pivotal as international trade and global connectedness comes under attack.\n\nCEN standards and the rules that govern them are sticky enough that Brexit, for example, probably will not undo them if it eventually takes place. In February 2018, before the British Parliament got down to serious discussion of what Brexit would really mean, BSI declared that it could and should remain a full member of European standards bodies. After all, those bodies are European (not just E.U.) organizations, and BSI can remain a member as long as it agrees that, when a European standard is developed, BSI will adopt it as a British national standard. While some hardcore Brexiteers might object, the standardizers believe that the U.K. should stay focused on European and global standards and the markets they support, whether or not they leave the E.U.\n\nBSI recognizes that consumers worldwide, including those in the U.K., have benefited from international standards because they have been key to expanding global markets. And standard-setting organizations will be crucial in maintaining the benefits of a global market, especially as politicians posture and threaten. These efforts will benefit citizens around the globe through lower prices and faster shipping.\n\nInternational standards bodies did so long before governments embraced globalization, and they'll keep doing so even if governments foolishly reject such interconnectedness today.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3HWUVU8t_pPN5VCvain-je0F4cs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5SLU3YD3EMI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 296215920}, {"uri": "1142236321", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "09:37:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T09:37:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8235294222831726, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/whats-at-stake-in-this-weeks-european-elections/2019/05/21/8da30b50-7b17-11e9-b1f3-b233fe5811ef_story.html", "title": "What's at stake in this week's European elections?", "body": "From left, politicians Geert Wilders of the Netherlands, Matteo Salvini of Italy, J\u00f6rg Meuthen of Germany, Marine Le Pen of France, Vaselin Marehki of Bulgaria, Jaak Madison of Estonia and Tomio Okamura of the Czech Republic attend a rally in Milan on May 18. (Luca Bruno/Associated Press) By Michael Birnbaum and Michael Birnbaum Brussels bureau chief covering Europe Griff Witte Griff Witte Europe-focused correspondent with extensive experience in the Middle East and South Asia May 22 at 5:00 AM\n\nBRUSSELS -- Europe's far-right nationalists will have a chance to expand their power in elections for European Parliament that begin Thursday, as they seek a breakthrough that could thwart the workings of the European Union and jolt capitals across the continent.\n\nThe once-every-five-years vote is the biggest exercise of democracy in the world outside India, giving the half-billion citizens of the 28 E.U. nations a chance to elect representatives to the European legislature.\n\nSince the last election in 2014, the European Union has been hammered by a refugee crisis, multiple mass-casualty terrorist attacks, a vote by the British people to exit the bloc, a security scare fueled by the Kremlin and a fitful economic recovery following the global financial crisis.\n\nMore so than in previous years, voters will be making fundamental choices about the trajectory of the E.U. The shades-of-gray options that have dominated past votes are giving way to stark decisions over the nature of Europe's union -- or whether there should be a union at all.\n\nAlthough far-right and other parties that are hostile toward the E.U. have been on the ballot for decades, they have never wielded so much influence or appeared poised to control such a substantial share of the 751 seats.\n\n\"We are ready to say today that the day of glory has arrived,\" French far-right leader Marine Le Pen declared Saturday at a raucous rally in Milan, where she appeared onstage alongside anti-immigration leaders from across the continent. \"We say no to this immigration that is submerging our countries and that endangers the security of our peoples, our resources and our civilizational values.\"\n\n[Europe's far right says it is united. But can ultranationalists find a way to work across borders?]\n\nFrom grand palazzi in Rome to art nouveau villas in Budapest, Europe's anti-migration right-wingers have been prepping their battering rams to knock down the doors of the European Parliament. No one expects them to win a majority, but their aim is less to legislate than to obstruct.\n\n\"This election is crucial for the future of Europe and the European Union,\" said David McAllister, a center-right German lawmaker who is the head of the foreign affairs committee in the European Parliament. \"The nationalists, the populists and the demagogues want to destroy European cooperation.\"\n\nThe traditional center-left and center-right parties -- already struggling last time around -- are expected to lose ground to parties further out on the political spectrum.\n\n\"The most important question in the European election is not right versus left -- the old, traditional ideological cleavage,\" said Peter Kreko, executive director of the Budapest-based Political Capital Institute. \"It's much more important what the mainstream-versus-extreme ratio looks like.\"\n\nAnd that ratio appears poised to change significantly, though not radically, as the vote rolls across Europe through the weekend. Most E.U. countries vote Sunday.\n\nThe biggest shift, according to poll-based forecasts, is that the center-right and center-left political families that have held sway in Brussels are likely to lose their combined majority. The latest projections show them falling from 53 percent of the vote to 42.\n\nTo continue to govern as a grand, across-the-aisle coalition -- as they do now -- they will need additional partners.\n\nNationalist and other far-right parties, meanwhile, are expected to rise from about one-fifth of the seats to a quarter. Others, including pro-business and environmentalist parties, are also expected to gain.\n\nThe European Parliament has long been a feeding ground, paradoxically, for Euroskeptic politicians. Until recently, few European citizens paid the legislature much attention. Election day turnout is often far lower than for national votes, favoring the passionate extremes who can mobilize their base. And once in office, lawmakers can use generous allowances to bolster their brand and their domestic legitimacy.\n\nThe body's powers are not sexy. It can't directly propose legislation, only approve reforms -- such as the data privacy overhaul that went into effect last year. National leaders keep major powers around security and foreign policy for themselves. Still, the European Parliament needs to sign off on senior E.U. leaders and the E.U. budget.\n\nThis year's shifts in representation may be relatively modest, but they could have a disproportionate impact on how the E.U. functions, putting the far right in good position to play spoiler.\n\n\"Even with a relatively small percentage of the vote, the potential to delegitimize the European Parliament is quite strong,\" said Almut M\u00f6ller, co-head of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"Brussels is used to operating according to the Brussels consensus. Now the picture will be different.\"\n\nA legislature with less ability to get things done would feed the narrative of the E.U.'s nationalist critics, who argue that the bloc is fundamentally broken. The chaos unleashed by Brexit has calmed demands in other countries to quit the E.U. altogether, but Euroskeptic leaders still want to chop away at its powers and rebuild barriers between countries.\n\n[Frexit? Italeave? After watching Brexit, other European countries say: No, thanks.]\n\n\"If your goal is destroying the E.U., then stagnation is a pretty good thing,\" said Marietje Schaake, a centrist Dutch member of the European Parliament.\n\nIn order for Europe's critics to wield maximum influence, they will need to work together -- something they have failed to do so far.\n\nThe far right is now distributed across three separate blocs in the European Parliament, with both personal and policy differences standing in the way of a confederacy of nationalists. One divide is on Russia, since Western Europe's far right tends to admire the Kremlin while its Eastern European compatriots can be suspicious of Moscow.\n\nAlso stalling the far right's march are signs that, at least in some places, its moment may be passing.\n\nWhile nationalists are unquestionably more popular now than they were during the last vote, in 2014, their support in many countries has leveled off as the memory of the 2015-2016 refugee crisis recedes.\n\nIn Germany, for instance, the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD) is forecast to nearly double its share of the vote from the last E.U. election, when the party was a newcomer protesting Greek bailouts.\n\nBut recent polls show it hasn't gained support since the 12.6 percent it won in Germany's 2017 federal election, and may have even lost a bit.\n\n\"These elections are part of the great shift in politics -- they're a move away from the old normal, but we aren't there yet,\" said Heather Grabbe, the director of the Open Society European Policy Institute. \"What you see across Europe is people moving out of mainstream parties to alternative parties.\"\n\nAnother X-factor for the far right will be fallout from Austria, where the government collapsed in spectacular fashion on Monday after a video revealed the leader of the country's premier far-right party apparently willing to engage in corrupt deals with Russians.\n\nThe scandal doomed a coalition between the center right and the far right that some in both camps had touted as an alternative future for Europe beyond the cozy left-right coalitions that have dominated in Brussels.\n\nBritain's participation in the election may provide a shot of sugar for Euroskeptics, with Nigel Farage's Brexit Party set for a good showing on Thursday. But those lawmakers will leave the European Parliament whenever Britain finally manages to quit the bloc.\n\n[In what may be Britain's last European election, Farage's new Brexit Party is expected to dominate]\n\nIn France, President Emmanuel Macron has framed the election as a chance to move toward a more integrated Europe, but one that better responds to the insecurities that have fueled nationalist movements. He has campaigned aggressively and has effectively \"declared the poll to be a referendum on his presidency,\" the Eurasia Group political consultancy wrote in an analysis this week.\n\nIf he fails to best the Marine Le Pen-led far right, the analysis concluded, \"the final three years of his presidency -- and hopes of pushing through deep reforms of education, pensions and the civil service -- will have been damaged.\"\n\n[Macron wants to revive Europe, but European elections could kill his plans.]\n\nMuch may depend on whether he can convince French voters that he can shake up Europe, but in a way that is different from the radical visions of the far right.\n\n\"The more the mainstream is tempted to stay with the status quo,\" said M\u00f6ller, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, \"the more it is that the parties on the fringes will succeed.\"\n\nWitte reported from Berlin.

Salvini then declared \"the extremists are in Brussels,\" the home of EU institutions, for wanting to retain the status quo.\n\n\"We need to do everything that is right to free this country, this continent, from the illegal occupation organized by Brussels,\" Salvini said.\n\nTAKING FROM THE TRUMP PLAYBOOK\n\nEurope's far-right and nationalist parties hope to emulate what President Donald Trump did in the 2016 U.S. election and what Brexiteers achieved in the U.K. referendum to leave the EU. That is to disrupt the powers that be, rail against what they see as an out-of-touch elite and warn against migrants massing at Europe's borders ready to rob the continent of its jobs and culture.\n\nStanding with Salvini, Le Pen promised the far-right \"will perform a historic feat,\" saying they could end up as high as the second-biggest political group in the EU parliament.\n\nPredictions show that is still extremely ambitious. Projections released by the European Parliament this month show the center-right European People's Party bloc losing 37 of its 217 seats and the center-left S&D group dropping from 186 seats to 149.\n\nAs for the far-right and nationalists, the Europe of Nations and Freedom group is predicted to win 62 seats, compared to 37 currently. Such statistics though could be irrelevant as soon as Monday if national parties start shifting to other EU-wide political groups in the 751-seat European legislature which meets both in Brussels and France's Strasbourg.\n\nOrban's nationalist Fidesz party is now in the EPP's ranks, but has been suspended for its anti-EU stance and virulent anti-migration rhetoric. The Hungarian prime minister might well bolt after the election to a new radical-right group, perhaps to be formed by Salvini, Le Pen and other nationalist leaders.\n\nWAR, TAXES, UNEMPLOYMENT\n\nFor many among the EU's half billion citizens, the memories of war have vanished and the EU's role in helping to keep the peace for 75 years, a feat for which it won the Nobel Prize, is overlooked.\n\nYet Europe was body-slammed by the financial crisis a decade ago and struggled through a yearslong debt crisis that saw nations like Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus get bailouts and produced recessions that slashed the incomes of millions.\n\nEurope's high taxes, stagnant wages and gap between rich and poor are still a sore point, highlighted now by weekly protests by France's yellow vest movement demanding more help for hard-pressed workers. EU nations have also not been able to forge a common approach to migration, fueling inter-bloc tensions, and its impotence in quickly containing a migrant influx in 2015 has propelled a surge of support for far-right and nationalist parties.\n\n\"We have a crisis of the European Union. This is a matter of fact,\" Macron acknowledged.\n\nExperts say he's right.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who fear that things potentially are moving in the wrong direction or already have moved in the wrong direction,\" said Janis Emmanouilidis at the European Policy Centre think-tank in Brussels. \"It is a mix of multiple insecurities which, at the end of the day, is pushing people toward those who are coming up with easy answers.\"\n\nTURNING INTO A POTENT FORCE\n\nSince the first European Parliament election in 1979, the legislature has slowly changed from a toothless organization where over-the-hill politicians got cushy pre-retirement jobs to a potent force with real decision-making powers.\n\nThe EU at first primarily regulated farming but now sets international trade policy for all members and even monetary rules for the 19 nations who use the shared euro currency.\n\nThe legislature itself affects Europeans' daily lives in thousands of ways: cutting smartphone roaming charges, imposing safety and health rules for industries ranging from chemicals and energy to autos and food, supporting farming, reforming copyright rules and protecting the environment.\n\nThere are no cross-border elections this week, just national polls in 28 nations. Each EU nation gets a number of seats in the EU parliament based on its population. Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta have the fewest seats with six each, while the EU's most populous member, Germany, has 96 seats.\n\nUp until now, EU elections were tepid affairs. Voter turnout slumped to just 42.6% in 2014 -- but that could well change this year.\n\nWHICH WAY FORWARD?\n\nThe pro-EU side says increasing integration is essential for the EU to survive in a globalized world. Euroskeptics say it robs national identity whenever more decisions are made at EU headquarters in Brussels.\n\nYet even some mainstream conservatives can have a euroskeptic streak. Czech politician Jan Zahradil, lead candidate for the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists, is among those seeking to return more control to Europe's national capitals.\n\n\"(We want) an EU that is scaled back, that is flexible, that is decentralized,\" Zahradil said. \"(An EU) that respects national governments and that cooperates with them, that doesn't fight them, that doesn't patronize them, that doesn't lecture them.\"\n\nFor the pro-EU side, in a world in which China, the U.S. and Russia are all flexing their political and financial muscles, Macron urges voters to think about the strength and unity that comes from 28 smaller nations working together.\n\n\"If you fragment Europe, there is no chance you have a stronger Europe. Unity makes strength,\" Macron said.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels, Angela Charlton in Paris, Elena Becatoros in Athens and Colleen Barry in Milan contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more news from The Associated Press on the European Parliament elections go to https://www.apnews.com/EuropeanParliament\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

No Problem. The Patchwork Brexit Party Is Crushing Its Opponents.", "body": "WILLENHALL, England -- The candidates walked down the ballroom aisle to loud ovations and corporate rock, taking turns at the lectern delivering pitches for the Brexit Party: a deep-pocketed Tory known for churning through managers at his soccer club; an ex-Labour voter and son of a coal miner whose hometown despised Margaret Thatcher; a dental surgeon who said she believed the European Union was indoctrinating children \"like Stalin's kids and Komsomol and Hitler Youth.\"\n\nOne by one they let loose with a bare-bones populism largely bereft of any demonstrable political ideology or, for that matter, any detectable policies save one -- taking Britain out of the European Union promptly, and if necessary with no deal.\n\nBut by cloaking its message in the language of democracy and disgust with the political elite, the party -- formed just four months ago -- is threatening to become not just a vessel for discontent with Brexit, but also a more permanent pain to Britain's two main parties, the Conservatives and the opposition Labour. Just how successful it will be is one of the towering political questions for the coming year.\n\nRight now it is on a roll, expected to cruise to a strong first-place finish in elections to the European Parliament this week, even as smaller pro-Remain parties also pick off voters from the main parties.\n\nAs Brexit chainsaws its way through British politics, dismantling decades-old political allegiances, tearing apart the traditional parties and leaving voters confused, frustrated and angry, the Brexit Party is thriving by offering a simple and hard-edge message.\n\n\"People feel completely betrayed, they feel abandoned, they feel even hated and despised by the political class and also by the media,\" said Martin Daubney, the lifelong Labour voter now standing for the Brexit Party, who used to edit a raunchy men's magazine before reinventing himself as an anti-pornography advocate. \"It feels like a grass-roots political revolution on the streets of Britain right now.\"\n\nThe party's frontman, Nigel Farage, is hoping a big win in the European elections will provide a reaffirmation of the public will to leave the European Union. But it is far more complicated than that. The European elections, typically low-turnout affairs dominated by the most ideologically motivated voters, are an imperfect barometer.\n\nIn March, moreover, hundreds of thousands of people flooded London's streets in a rally for a people's vote on Brexit, making a strong statement about grass-roots sentiment against leaving the European Union, and some polls have shown a tentative shift in public sentiment toward remaining in the bloc. The centrist Liberal Democrats have inched ahead of Labour in some European election polls on the back of an unapologetically anti-Brexit message. And there has never been a majority for a no-deal Brexit in Parliament.\n\nBut Mr. Farage is thinking big, vowing to run candidates, including himself, in any coming domestic general election. And the party's success this week will surely become leverage for ardent Brexiteers already eager to replace Prime Minister Theresa May with someone who supports a no-deal Brexit.\n\nYet if politics can sometimes make odd bedfellows, the Brexit Party is taking that principle to the extreme, running candidates from all over the political spectrum. The party has even recruited as candidates three former members of the Revolutionary Communist Party and its successor groups, which defended deadly bombings by the Irish Republican Army in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nMr. Farage has defended his heterodox candidate slate as the seed of a nonpartisan pro-democracy movement. Analysts are dubious, however, saying he is more likely looking for ways to lure disaffected pro-Brexit Labour voters and provide a counterbalance to his history in the anti-immigration, largely right-wing 2016 Leave campaign.\n\n\"It's rational party competition,\" said Alan Wager, a research associate at the U.K. in a Changing Europe, a research institute. \"It's wearing the clothing of idealism and optimism, but it's not an optimistic or idealistic message really.\"\n\nJohn Malcolm, 75, a lifelong Conservative voter sitting beside his wife, seemed to speak for many in the crowd in Willenhall when he said he did not terribly much care whom the Brexit Party would send to Brussels.\n\n\"I wasn't looking for someone to represent me in Europe,\" he said. \"I'm looking for this party to do extremely well to show what we think on this issue to the other parties.\"\n\nVoters have used the European elections for protest votes before, but the Brexit Party, born in the wreckage of Mrs. May's deal, is unusually empty of formal policies. Its candidates rarely venture beyond its signature issue and populist themes, leaning on phrases like a \"clean Brexit\" but mostly dodging questions about what that means -- what arrangements they would make for Britain's borders, its airlines or its financial services industry, for example.\n\nOn the stage in Willenhall last week, there was hardly even much talk about why Britain was leaving the European Union in the first place. Immigration, the fuel of the 2016 Leave campaign, largely went unmentioned, a casualty of softening voter attitudes and fears about being accused of racism.\n\nInstead, the crowd roared at attacks on civil servants, Brussels bureaucrats, lawmakers and journalists. (The party banned Channel 4 News from its events after it broadcast an investigation into Mr. Farage's finances.)\n\nMr. Daubney, the Brexit Party candidate, slammed a leader of the campaign for a second Brexit referendum for putting stock in what people said at dinner parties, instead of at the chip shops and pubs where, Mr. Daubney said, \"I hang out with real people.\" Mr. Farage whipped up the crowd with talk of the \"treachery, duplicity of all of our political leaders\" and Britain's humiliation as a country of \"lions led by donkeys.\"\n\nThe party is experimenting internally with forms of direct democracy, planning what Mr. Daubney described as an online forum where supporters could weigh in on party policy. Italy's anti-establishment Five Star Movement runs a similar platform.\n\nUnlike Britain's main parties, whose leaders have to answer to a vast membership and various interest groups, the Brexit Party is effectively controlled by Mr. Farage. Its secrecy has generated concerns about foreign and untraceable donations to the party's PayPal, and the Electoral Commission, which regulates party finances, responded on Tuesday by reviewing its fund-raising systems, though it said it had \"not seen evidence of electoral offenses.\" Brexit Party officials have described the accusations as a \"disgusting smear\" and denied taking illegal foreign funds.\n\nMore concerning to some analysts is how the party is becoming a personal vehicle for Mr. Farage. \"It's new in the sense that politics is about the choice between policies and personalities, whereas Nigel Farage is obviously creating new rules,\" said Mr. Wager, the research associate. \"The no-policies, the way the organization is all dominated by him, is starting to look very autocratic.\"\n\nThe 1,200-person crowd in Willenhall -- mostly, but not entirely, conforming to polls showing the party relying on older voters -- did not want to be voting in the first place, given that Britain was supposed to have left the European Union in March. But they were all too happy to unload on politicians, calling out \"traitor!\" and \"coward!\"\n\nThe heavy turnout, in a town once dominated by lock and key makers and held for decades by Labour, reflected a turn in British politics from divisions over class lines to those over values like liberalism and authoritarianism, said Paula Surridge, a senior lecturer at the University of Bristol who has studied the shift.\n\nMr. Daubney said Labour had started focusing too much on racism and sexism, which he said had led to policies that \"tend to disfavor the bulk of the electorate, who are white people.\"\n\nThe Brexit Party's success beyond the European elections is by no means assured. The Conservative Party could well dump Mrs. May and turn to an arch-Brexiteer like Boris Johnson, the former foreign minister who was a leading Leave campaigner in the 2016 referendum, as party leader to woo back Tories who defected to Mr. Farage.\n\nThat would be a reprise of Mr. Farage's role leading up to 2016 as leader of the U.K. Independence Party, when he startled the Conservative government into calling the Brexit referendum in the first place.\n\nEven failing that, there is a natural tendency for voters to return to their traditional parties in general elections. On the other hand, Brexit could spell an end to such norms, staying resonant enough that the Brexit Party splits the right-wing electorate and allows the Labour Party to form a government under Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n\"The question is: Is this different because of it being about Brexit?\" said Rob Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester. \"We don't know the answer for certain.\"\n\nIn the audience in Willenhall, some voters said they had backed Mr. Farage as leader of the U.K. Independence Party in the last European elections, then switched their votes to Mrs. May after she promised to take Britain out of Europe's main economic institutions. But never again.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what happens from now on, I will never ever stick a cross in the Tory box ever again,\" said Andrew Kirby, 44, sitting beside his father. \"There's nothing that could happen. If the Brexit Party doesn't come to anything, I shall never vote again.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_mueller@nytimes.com", "name": "Benjamin Mueller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/21/world/21brexitparty1/21brexitparty1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800134", "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 296201700}, {"uri": "1141777197", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "20:55:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T20:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/books/review/upheaval-jared-diamond.html", "title": "What to Do When You're a Country in Crisis", "body": "When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\n\nUPHEAVAL\n\nTurning Points for Nations in Crisis\n\nBy Jared Diamond\n\nIf you've ever been at a wedding or conference or on board a United connection from O'Hare, and been cornered by a man with Theories About It All, and you came away thinking, \"That was a great experience,\" have I got the book for you.\n\nJared Diamond's \"Upheaval\" belongs to the genre of 30,000-foot books, which sell an explanation of everything. I travel often and see them a lot: at airport bookstores, where Steven Pinker and Yuval Noah Harari (both of whom blurbed \"Upheaval\") and Diamond, of course, deserve permanent shelves; and in the air, where I've noticed that a pretty disproportionate fraction of readers who read in the quiet of 30,000 feet have a preference for writers who write from the viewpoint of 30,000 feet.\n\nSo I dug into Diamond's latest, intrigued by his thesis that the way individual humans cope with crisis might teach something to countries. Then, before long, the first mistake caught my eye; soon, the 10th. Then graver ones. Errors, along with generalizations, blind spots and oversights, that called into question the choice to publish. I began to wonder why we give some people, and only some, the platform, and burden, to theorize about everything.\n\nThe theory proposed by Diamond -- a professor of geography at the University of California at Los Angeles and the author of several books, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Guns, Germs and Steel\" -- is interesting. Human beings go through personal crises all the time. We know a lot about how people change in order to cope -- or fail to. What if we applied those lessons to countries in quagmires?\n\n[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of May. See the full list. ]\n\nDrawing on the work of therapists, Diamond reports that the key for individuals coping with a crisis is \"selective change.\" People who successfully overcome a problem tend to identify and isolate it, figuring out \"which parts of their identities are already functioning well and don't need changing, and which parts are no longer working and do need changing.\" Diamond asks, Could the same be true for countries? He believes so, and he seeks to test his theory by adapting a dozen factors known to affect the resolution of personal crises to national crises. Some factors translate easily -- just as people must first accept being in crisis, nations must first come to a consensus about their woes. Other analogies feel more strained -- help from your close friends translates into material and financial aid from allies. Armed with this framework, Diamond sets out to see how well it fits countries' actual histories.\n\nDiamond's method is the case study. Looking at Finland, Japan, Chile, Indonesia, Germany, Australia and the United States at pivotal moments in their histories, he evaluates their courses of action with reference to his 12 bullet points. Meiji-era Japan, needing to open up to the world while preserving its cultural core, found a way \"to adopt many Western features, but to modify them to suit Japanese circumstances.\" After World War II, Germany worked its way to taking full responsibility for its actions and thereby successfully transformed itself. America, in part because it shrugs off the lessons of other places, struggles to resolve its issues.\n\nAt the end of each chapter, each mini-history, Diamond pauses to ask some variant of: \"How does Indonesia's crisis fit into our framework?\" And this is a tell. The Framework is driving the inquiry here, and everything stands at its service. The people we encounter are seldom richly portrayed, because only The Framework matters. The stories we learn about each country are often partial and slanted, because only The Framework matters. Countries where racism and tolerance, sexism and equality have long been in tension are portrayed as being entirely one thing before magically becoming the opposite thing, because The Framework can only process monoliths.\n\nWith a focus on The Framework, facts recede in importance. The book is riddled with errors. Diamond gets wrong the year of the Brexit vote. He claims that, under President Ronald Reagan, \"government shutdowns were nonexistent.\" But they occurred a number of times. He describes Australian-rules football as a sport \"invented in Australia and played nowhere else.\" But it is played elsewhere -- in Nauru, where it is the national sport, as well as in China, Canada, France, Japan, Ireland and the United States, according to the Australian Football League.\n\nDiamond says a 1976 terrorist attack in Washington, D.C., targeting a former Chilean official, was \"the only known case of a foreign terrorist killing an American citizen on American soil -- until the World Trade Towers attack of 2001.\" This claim wholly overlooks the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, in which six people died. He refers to Lee Kuan Yew as \"Singapore's prime minister,\" even though he no longer occupies that role, not least because he's dead.\n\nThen the generalizations: hoo boy. At one point during World War II, Diamond says, the people of Finland, facing Soviet bellicosity, \"were unanimous in refusing to compromise further.\" A whole nation, unanimous! We learn of another instance of 100 percent society-wide agreement down under, where \"Australians debating the federal constitution argued about many matters but were unanimous about excluding all nonwhite races from Australia.\" But in fact they argued about this issue, too, and one framer, Andrew Inglis Clark, the Tasmanian attorney general, sought, unsuccessfully, to introduce an adapted version of the American 14th Amendment, which would have prohibited discrimination by race.\n\nIn claiming that Germany has become more socially liberal, Diamond claims, \"There is no spanking of children; in fact, it's now forbidden by law!\" But how can a serious thinker confuse the passage of a law with fidelity to it? An organization that tracks the efficacy of the law has found its enactment to have reduced, but hardly ended hitting. To read Diamond is also to learn, apparently, how all Chileans identify (with Europe and the United States, not Latin America); and how all \"Indonesians take their national identity for granted.\" (Except, perhaps, the separatist groups?)\n\nSometimes the book feels written from a drying well of lifelong research rather than from the latest facts. For example, Diamond tells us Americans have always been a highly mobile people and are \"unlikely\" to \"move less often.\" He must be unfamiliar with the rather well-publicized new data declaring the opposite: \"Fewer Americans Are Moving to Pursue Better Jobs Across the Nation,\" NPR says, citing the Census Bureau's research that the number of Americans who move in a given year has dropped by half since the 1940s.\n\nThere are far more of these errors than I have space to list, too many to dismiss this calling-out as nit-picking. And they matter because of the book's nature. If we can't trust you on the little and medium things, how can we trust you where authors of 30,000-foot books really need our trust -- on the big, hard-to-check claims? On how the end of the White Australia policy \"resulted from five considerations.\" (Not four, not six, and the ones you happen to name.) On how Finns' love of their language is what made them willing to fight and die for Finland. On how Tokyo is clean \"because Japanese children learn to be clean and to clean up\" (and not, for example, because the city spends 3.9 percent of its budget on public health and sanitation, according to a quick search, compared with the 1.9 percent of New York City's 2018 budget that went to the Department of Sanitation).\n\nWhile \"Upheaval\" does list sources in the back, Diamond seldom quotes books. He is far fonder of quoting his many friends. \"Why does Japan pursue these stances? My Japanese friends suggest three explanations.\" That's what we're going with? Or he describes \"the 1973 coup that many of my Chilean friends characterize as inevitable.\" First of all, why are we paying you to hear your friends' random theories? Second of all, how can a coup ever be inevitable? You mean to say that a plot as delicate as that could under no scenario have gone wrong?\n\nSince we're talking about our friends, I know so many younger writers, especially women and people of color, who are smart, thoughtful, buttoned up and pretty damn accurate who would kill for an opening to publish a book with a serious publisher -- and who know in their bones that, if they were ever this sloppy, their career would be over before it had even begun.\n\nThere is also a systemic issue here. The time has come for those of us who work in book-length nonfiction to insist that professional fact-checking become as inalienable from publishing as publicity, marketing and jacket design -- and at the publisher's expense rather than as a cost passed on to the author, who, understandably, will often choose to spend her money on health care. In the age of tweets, it cannot be the fate of the book to become ever more tweetlike -- maybe factual, maybe whatever. The book must stand apart, must stand above.\n\nA remaining problem with \"Upheaval\" is one that cannot be fact-checked away, but, happily, is already being fixed across the world of letters. Until recently, in much of American life, and American writing, the default setting of human being was white and/or male. Today so much writing shatters this default, complicates the point of view. And \"Upheaval\" reminds us why that matters.\n\nWhen Diamond describes \"highly egalitarian social values\" as an ethos that has \"remained unchanged\" in Australia, despite having written a chapter about the country's history of legalized racism, he is using a definition of egalitarian that applies only to white people. When he says, \"Social status in Japan depends more on education than on heredity and family connection,\" he is ignoring what it means to be born a woman. \"Of course, my list of U.S. problems isn't exhaustive,\" he admits. \"Problems that I don't discuss include race relations and the role of women.\" You know, the problems affecting the vast majority of Americans.\n\nI almost felt bad for Diamond when, toward the end, he described \"an evening with two women friends, one of them a psychologically na\u00efve optimist in her 20s, the other a perceptive person in her 70s.\" What made the young woman \"psychologically na\u00efve\" to him was that she dated someone who it took her time to see was terrible. (If that's a crime, jail us all.) I felt a strange sympathy for Diamond, who is in his early 80s, because clearly he didn't realize how tone-deaf it is, in 2019, for an established male author to go around labeling a young woman making pretty normal life mistakes as \"psychologically na\u00efve.\" But Diamond is proud to be from another time. He tells us his manuscripts are typed by someone else, he relies on his wife and secretary to use a computer, and he clings to the belief that video games are \"solitary,\" even if massively multiplayer online games are where a growing number of Americans go to be social. He also thinks phones are ruining America because people check them every four minutes. But I have to say, I was doing just that while reading his book, and I was doing it because so many things I read didn't sound accurate, and I, for one, think it's an improvement when 30,000-foot authority can be challenged by Googling from bed.\n\nOn a beach some time ago, I read Jill Lepore's new history of the United States, \"These Truths.\" It is no less ambitious than \"Upheaval.\" But it is a new kind of big book for a new age. We know so much more now. We know the stories that haven't been told, the points of view that have been neglected. Lepore manages to tell many stories, ever shifting her own perspective. She has no pat Framework, no bullet-point theory to test. She tells earthy stories about people famous and obscure, and she is confident enough to let the ideas emerge.

She has signaled she will step down if her thrice-rejected divorce deal fails again in the House of Commons, as it is widely expected to do.\n\nIn a sign that the British public has already moved on, many of the questions May fielded during Tuesday's news conference had to do with when she will resign and what might happen after that.\n\nParliament is scheduled to vote again on the Brexit deal she negotiated with the European Union during the first week of June -- which, coincidentally, is also when President Trump will be making a state visit to Britain.\n\n\"What I'm doing today is setting out what I believe is a new Brexit deal that can command a majority in the House of Commons,\" said May, a fatally wounded but dogged politician.\n\nOffering a binding vote on a second referendum, as well as on whether Britain should remain in a temporary customs union with the E.U., represents a shift in strategy for May. She said she recognized \"the genuine and sincere strength of feeling\" on the referendum issue. But she also reiterated her long held views that a second referendum was not her preferred way out of the current Brexit impasse. Extending the Brexit debate, she said, \"risked opening the door to a nightmare future of permanently polarized politics.\"\n\nMay hopes that with those additional voting opportunities and some tweaks to her deal -- including pledges on environmental protections and workers' rights -- she can win over enough lawmakers to get it over the line. But early indicators were not looking good.\n\nSome Conservative lawmakers who'd previously backed May said they would now oppose her. The Scottish National Party and ChangeUK said they would not back her. Nigel Dodds, the deputy leader of Northern Ireland Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May's Conservatives, said the proposal had \"fundamental flaws.\"\n\nThe opposition Labour Party has been internally divided on whether to push for a second referendum, with leader Jeremy Corbyn reluctant to embrace the idea.\n\nIn a speech that was at times reflective, May said that she never thought that delivering Brexit would be \"simple or straightforward,\" but said that it had \"proved even harder than I anticipated.\" She said that she'd given it her all, even offering to \"give up the job I love earlier than I like.\"\n\nIn the question-and-answer session that followed her speech, May was asked several times about her departure and who she'd like to see replace her. May didn't offer fresh details, but she has previously promised to outline the timetable of her departure if she loses the next Brexit vote.\n\nThe unofficial race to replace her is underway. On Tuesday, Jacob Rees-Mogg, an influential Brexiteer, said he was throwing his support behind the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, the leader in the polls.\n\nRead more\n\nChelsea Flower Show wows with a royal treehouse and climate change garden\n\nBrexit talks collapse, setting up Theresa May's likely departure\n\nBritish voters with Brexit on their minds punish main parties in local elections", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GbUpv5Ydn2kTElVHpYcP-konC-M=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I3YVXHT334I6TJNTGTZ634JVDY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4797625", "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 296161620}, {"uri": "1141666726", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "17:56:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T17:56:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/chelsea-flower-show-wows-with-a-royal-treehouse-and-climate-change-garden/2019/05/21/361d4288-7b17-11e9-b1f3-b233fe5811ef_story.html", "title": "Chelsea Flower Show wows with a royal treehouse and climate change garden", "body": "Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, shows Queen Elizabeth II around the \"Back to Nature\" garden she designed for the 2019 Chelsea Flower Show in London. (Geoff Pugh/AFP/Getty Images) By William Booth William Booth London bureau chief May 21 at 1:24 PM\n\nLONDON -- The Chelsea Flower Show -- the most prestigious, most over-the-top floral exhibition in the world -- opened Tuesday with a visit from the queen to her granddaughter-in-law's luxe-rustic kiddie treehouse set in a pop-up English countryside simulacrum, next to the champagne and gin tents, already doing brisk business in the morning sunshine.\n\nCarrying on since 1913, with brief pause for two world wars, the Chelsea show still manages to be fun and besotted, fuddy-duddy and cutting-edge. It marks the beginning of the English summer social season, with gents in straw hats, ladies in floral frocks. And it draws sold-out throngs of plant obsessives to stroll the transformed greensward of the Royal Hospital and smell the patent-pending roses.\n\nThe loss of empire and the looming Brexit be damned, nobody does puttering in the backyard quite like Britain, still the globe's greatest gardening nation.\n\nThis year's big display gardens featured an homage to the Yorkshire countryside, complete with a working canal lock; a sand-dune flavored lounge-thing from Dubai; several \"urban gardens\" for clients with penthouse spaces and big bucks (they were awesome, needed to green the cities); a \"Resilience Garden,\" a first here that focuses on Britain's changing climate (think yucca in Wessex, prickly pear in Kent); and a quiet, cool, green one for Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), the show's sponsors, called the \"Back To Nature\" garden.\n\nThis last doozy was co-designed by Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, wife to a most likely future king, Prince William, and mother to three heirs and spares.\n\nKate's \"woodland space\" was \"inspired by childhood memories ... a place to retreat from the world, to play, learn and discover as well as create special family memories,\" as described by the RHS.\n\nThe forests, the pamphlet informed, are good for a child's mental health and development.\n\nA treehouse perched on an ancient stump (cost unknown), clad in stag horn oak, was the centerpiece. There was a flowing pebbled brook to play in, a swing to swing on, and a hollow log to crawl through.\n\nThere was also a twee teepee made of sticks, a crude bow and arrow, and a wee fire pit -- the perfect setting to learn to play responsibly with matches and DIY weapons.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II, dressed in a green coat over a purple and green floral frock, gave it high royal marks.\n\n\"It's very tidy,\" the Queen said Tuesday morning, according to royal pool report.\n\nWilliam and Kate's kids visited over the weekend and were photographed, appropriately frolicking about in bare feet and perfect little outfits.\n\nThese show pieces and feature displays -- the biggest gardens occupy 2,800 square feet, the floor plan of an ample home -- can take weeks of feverish work to assemble, completely from scratch, with \"planting teams\" going at it almost 24/7, erecting mature (transplanted) elms, sequoias, cedars.\n\nChelsea Pensioners pose for photographers on a stand at the Chelsea Flower Show in London. (Matt Dunham/AP)\n\nOne of the gardens this year featured a temporary giant redwood, 42 feet tall, perhaps one the tallest ever at Chelsea. It will live here until Saturday and then be transferred elsewhere.\n\nA veteran garden designer confessed that they used to compost most of the plants, which were at their peak for the show -- though that practice has ended, and many survivors now find new homes in charity gardens or posh new settings.\n\nThe sheer overabundance of blooms, the perfect shabby-chic of the cottage styles are delirious. Each plant spooning the next, everything just right. As if they were hired like the wait staff, the gardens were already covered in bees.\n\nYou may want this garden.\n\nYou will never have this garden.\n\nThe artistry of re-creation is eye-popping.\n\nThe still unfurling ferns, old wooly moss, peak wildflowers appear as you find them in the heritage Grade II cottage in Somerset.\n\nBut none of this was here in April.\n\nThis year marks designer Mark Gregory's 99th Chelsea garden. His replica of a west Yorkshire canal and lock tender's cottage required the efforts of 60 workers, with cranes and hydraulics.\n\nPeople, there were dewy spider webs -- already!\n\nGregory said the show highlights \"something we're still good at, which is growing plants.\"\n\nHe said, \"we were once a great industrial powerhouse. Not so much now, I would say. But at horticultural? We're hard to beat.\"\n\nA model poses with a peony design body paint and hat at the Chelsea Flower Show. (Matt Dunham/AP)\n\nGregory said plants for gardens and vases outpace edible crops in Britain in gross domestic product.\n\nThe secret? \"Great climate, crap weather,\" he said, meaning it rains a lot but not too much, and is cool but not freezing, and warm in the summer, but not Kuwait.\n\nEngland has been nuts for plants since the Victorians made it an obsession. The Chelsea Flower Show is \"a shop window for the world,\" said Raymond Evison, who's been cultivating clematis on the England's balmy offshore tax haven island of Guernsey for decades. He sells 2 million plants a year, almost half to America.\n\nThe latest trend? \"More leisure time, but less time for gardening,\" he said. Clients want plants that burst into summer-long bloom, but don't require a lot of pruning.\n\nAnother trend? \"The Chinese,\" he said. They love the Chelsea Flower Show.\n\nThis was the first Chelsea show since the death of David Austin, Britain's most famous plant breeder, credited with restoring fragrance to the modern rose. But his family and company carried on, with two new roses and a \"Secret Garden\" themed display.\n\nDesigner Sarah Eberle made the Resilience Garden for this year's show. \"I wanted to deliver a message, come on, climate change is real, it's here, it's coming.\"\n\nAn exhibitor poses in a cactus design jacket at her stand at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show. (Toby Melville/Reuters)\n\nWhat would she grow in her English cottage garden of the future?\n\n\"It's not the future,\" she corrected.\n\nShe'd plant cacti, aloe, yucca. She'd plant trees that are drought-resistant, pest-resistant, that could handle new extremes -- too hot, too cold, at all the wrong times.\n\nShe'd manage her water better.\n\nEberle has been a garden designer for 40 years. She offered an observation. Early in her career, the wisdom went, a gardener here cut down her herbaceous perennials to the ground in late October. They'd sleep through the winter, grow again in the spring.\n\nBut now? \"They're growing waist-high by Christmas,\" she said. \"This is just in my years. There's no hard winter anymore. Many people might miss it. But a gardener? A gardener sees it with her own eyes.\"\n\nRead more\n\nPower pearls and political handbags: Margaret Thatcher auction fetches $1.4 million\n\nHow hippies, farmers and Prince Charles are preserving the ancient art of hedgelaying\n\nBritain's queen is counting her swans in a ritual with much poop and circumstance", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gS6-YBOUO8opufimSyyL1rZw0Vw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HQ3ZPLT3ZMI6TJNTGTZ634JVDY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4799722", "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 296157360}, {"uri": "1141642641", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "17:22:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T17:22:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4588235318660736, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/world/europe/theresa-may-referendum-brexit.html", "title": "Theresa May Offers U.K. Lawmakers a Vote on a Second Referendum", "body": "LONDON -- Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain on Tuesday dangled before lawmakers the prospect of a second referendum on Brexit, in a last-ditch effort to win over those who have rejected her three previous efforts to extract Britain from the European Union.\n\nIn a speech in London, Mrs. May outlined what she called a \"new Brexit deal,\" which would give Parliament a broader role in shaping her Brexit plan. But most attention focused on her offer to have lawmakers vote on whether to have a second referendum, something she had previously ruled out.\n\nMrs. May described the deal as \"one last chance\" to deliver on the 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union.\n\nIf lawmakers reject it again, she said, \"they are voting to stop Brexit.\" She added, \"If they do so, the consequences could hardly be greater.\"\n\nEarly reaction among Conservatives and Labour was not encouraging.\n\nThe Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said his party would not support the plan, calling it a \"rehash of what was discussed before.\" Pro-Brexit Conservatives reacted angrily as well, with Jacob Rees-Mogg, a lawmaker and leader of that faction, dismissing it as \"worse than before.\"\n\nOn the referendum, it was unclear how much of a concession Mrs. May was making. That is because she was offering lawmakers a chance to vote on whether to have a referendum, rather than supporting one herself. And she was vague about what question or questions any referendum would pose.\n\nHer new deal seemed designed to entice pro-Brexit Labour Party lawmakers to support her Brexit blueprint. It includes the opportunity for Parliament to decide on whether to keep a type of customs union with Brussels, eliminating tariffs and reducing checks on goods at frontiers -- a demand of Mr. Corbyn.\n\nBut in moving somewhat closer to Labour's position, she risked losing Conservative supporters of her plan.\n\nNor was she guaranteeing any new consensus on sensitive issues. Parliament has previously voted against a second referendum, and Mrs. May said she still opposed the idea, making it unlikely there would be sufficient support for it this time. Nor has Parliament yet managed to coalesce around any plan to stay in a customs union with the bloc.\n\nThe vote on legislation to leave the bloc, known as the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, is scheduled for the week beginning June 3. It is likely to be the final significant act of Mrs. May's tenure, as she has promised to set a date for her departure after the decision, ending almost three troubled years in power.\n\nMrs. May's latest Brexit deal differs from her previous one in that it offers Labour lawmakers more assurances on European standards on workplace protections and environmental rights.\n\nShe would also allow Parliament the right to demand, at least temporarily, a type of customs union with the bloc that is designed to prevent tariffs and many border checks on industrial goods, but only until the next general election, scheduled for 2022. And she is also offering the opportunity to vote on the second referendum.\n\nFor Conservative Brexit supporters the bill has some sweeteners in that it commits the government to working on technical measures to track goods that would prevent the need for border checks at the Irish border.\n\nCritically, however, this would not guarantee Britain staying out of the so-called Irish backstop, a device to avoid a hard border with Ireland. The backstop would keep the whole of the United Kingdom tied to Europe's customs rules indefinitely, outraging Brexit supporters who say it defeats the whole purpose of Brexit.\n\nOn Tuesday there was a backlash from hard-line pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers, including Iain Duncan Smith, a former party leader.\n\n\"The backstop is still there, it's a customs union in all but name and it puts Brussels firmly in control of our destiny,\" he said in a statement, adding that there was \"nothing new or bold about this bad buffet of non-Brexit options,\"\n\nOn Tuesday Mrs. May at least secured support from her fractured cabinet for her plan, no mean feat in itself. Yet, in Parliament, the math does not appear to have changed for Mrs. May -- at least not for the better.\n\nHer Conservatives are braced for a humiliating defeat in European elections this week, confronted by the challenge of the Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage, who wants Britain to leave the European Union fast, without any deal if necessary.\n\nSeveral of those vying to succeed Mrs. May are already arguing the same hard Brexit line. As a result, several hard-line pro-Brexit supporters within Mrs. May's Conservative Party, who reluctantly supported the last of her three efforts to get the plan through Parliament, are indicating they will revert to their earlier hostility.\n\nMark Francois, a prominent member of the hard-line Brexit faction told the BBC that the opposition to Mrs. May's deal was \"going up, not down.\"\n\n\"Unless she is rescued by a Marxist,\" said Mr. Francois, referring to Mr. Corbyn, \"the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead on arrival.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_castle@nytimes.com", "name": "Stephen Castle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/31/world/31may/31may-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4797625", "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 296155320}, {"uri": "1141509649", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "14:29:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T14:29:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2019/05/21/daily-202-why-a-judge-compared-trump-to-james-buchanan-in-ruling-against-his-bid-to-conceal-financial-records/5ce2f1351ad2e54b957e7fc6/", "title": "Analysis | The Daily 202: Why a judge compared Trump to James Buchanan in ruling against his bid to conceal financial records", "body": "THE BIG IDEA: Just like President Trump, James Buchanan complained of \"harassment\" by Congress.\n\nA federal judge on Monday drew a parallel between the two presidents as he rejected an effort by Trump's lawyers to quash a subpoena from the House Oversight Committee for records from the president's accounting firm. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta of the District of Columbia opened his 41-page opinion with a lengthy quote from Buchanan complaining, in 1860, about the House opening an investigation into him.\n\n\"He maintained that the House of Representatives possessed no general powers to investigate him, except when sitting as an impeaching body,\" Mehta noted. \"Buchanan feared that, if the House were to exercise such authority, it 'would establish a precedent dangerous and embarrassing to all my successors, to whatever political party they might be attached.' Some 160 years later, President Donald J. Trump has taken up the fight of his predecessor.\"\n\nFor Mehta to lead with Buchanan, and such an explicit comparison to the current occupant of the Oval Office, is the judicial equivalent of what kids call a sick burn. Mehta's opinion goes on to offer a meaty history lesson for a president who has never cared much for the discipline. The judge cites Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton as he outlines why the House is entitled to the records it seeks. After recounting the Whitewater, Watergate and Teapot Dome investigations, Mehta concludes: \"This court is not prepared to roll back the tide of history.\"\n\n-- By any metric, Buchanan was one of our worst presidents. He was elected president in 1856. In the 1858 midterms, Republicans won functional control of the House with a plurality. But Democrats still held the Senate and the White House and controlled the Supreme Court. Washington descended into a gridlock far worse than what we know now. Sectional differences splintered Democrats between the North and South. Faced with Abraham Lincoln's likely victory in 1860, the proslavery \"fire-eaters\" advocated secession. Buchanan took the position that states didn't have the legal right to secede, but that there was nothing the federal government could do legally to stop them. He allowed the country to fall apart with a policy of inactivity during the transition. It took Lincoln's heroic leadership, four years and countless casualties to put down the rebellion.\n\n-- In addition to being feckless, the Buchanan administration was corrupt. Jasmin Bath, a historian of 19th-century political and economic culture, wrote a piece for the Outlook section last week about the committee that Buchanan was so angry about: \"Without Pennsylvania, Buchanan would not have gained enough electoral votes to win. Knowing this, state Democrats did what they could to get Buchanan into the White House, including using federal funds to finance their campaign. Although this was not uncovered until four years later, suspicions of payoffs and fraud tainted Buchanan's victory. ...\n\n\"In March 1860, a congressional committee made up of three Republicans and two Democrats began investigating. Nicknamed the Covode Committee after its chairman, John Covode, it produced a detailed majority report that exposed the crimes of the Democratic Party and the president himself. The sheer volume of corruption uncovered was startling. Although there was not enough evidence to impeach Buchanan, the report exposed extensive corruption that took place during his presidency: bribery, the disfranchisement of some voters in federal elections, abuses of printing contracts, subsidies for partisan presses from public accounts. The list went on and on.\n\n\"The committee's findings were released to the public in June 1860, just months before the presidential election, and proved to be incredibly damaging to the Democratic Party's reputation, even though Buchanan was not running again. Its detailed accounts of the misdeeds of the Democratic administration, which circulated throughout the North, gave the Republican Party substantial evidence with which to persuade the public that the United States could not afford the continued reign of the 'rotten and dishonest' Democratic politicians.\n\n\"Many contemporaries believed the Covode report had an impact on the results of the election. According to one Democratic campaign manager, August Belmont, 'the country at large had become disgusted with the misrule of Mr. Buchanan, and the corruption which disgraced his Administration' and the 'Democratic party was made answerable for [Buchanan's] misdeeds, and change was ardently desired by thousands of conservative men out of politics.' Even Southerners agreed. One slaver owner, Sidney George Fisher, argued that 'the corruptions and excesses of the administration were very influential in producing Republican victory.'\"\n\n-- Mehta outlined how reviewing financial records fits \"comfortably\" within Congress's broad powers. He said the legislative branch serves an \"informing function\" that boils down to the ability to expose corruption in the other branches. \"It is simply not fathomable that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct -- past or present -- even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry,\" wrote Mehta, who was appointed by Barack Obama.\n\n-- Trump called the decision \"crazy\" and promised to challenge it. \"We think it's totally the wrong decision by, obviously, an Obama-appointed judge,\" he told reporters.\n\n-- The judge gave Trump one week to formally appeal. \"The President is subject to the same legal standard as any other litigant that does not prevail,\" he noted.\n\n-- The ruling came down shortly after the White House officially blocked former counsel Don McGahn from testifying to Congress, releasing a memo from a Trump appointee at the Justice Department to justify the decision. \"The 15-page legal opinion written by Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel argues McGahn cannot be compelled to testify before the committee, based on past Justice Department legal opinions regarding the president's close advisers,\" Rachael Bade, Josh Dawsey and Devlin Barrett report. \"The memo says McGahn's immunity from congressional testimony is separate and broader than a claim of executive privilege. ...\n\n\"As a private citizen no longer in the government, McGahn is not necessarily bound by the White House directive ... [but his] lawyer, William A. Burck, said the former counsel would not testify. 'Mr. McGahn remains obligated to maintain the status quo and will respect the President's instruction,' Burck wrote. Testifying could jeopardize business and professional standing for McGahn, who works for Jones Day, a Republican law firm with close ties to the Trump campaign and electoral politics. Jones Day will still be involved in the reelection campaign but will have a reduced role from 2016, campaign officials say, when they were the main firm.\"\n\n-- Nancy Pelosi repeatedly cited Mehta's opinion last night during private sessions aimed at discouraging members of her own leadership team from breaking with her publicly on impeachment in the face of Trump's stonewalling vis-a-vis McGahn. \"Today we won our first case,\" she told a group of House Democrats, according to someone in the room. \"We've been in this thing for almost five months, and now we're getting some results. ... We still have unexhausted avenues here.\"\n\nAfter meeting privately with Pelosi last night, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler also mentioned Mehta's ruling as a reason not to jump the gun on impeachment. \"We have to enforce the right to our testimony through the courts, which is the only way you can do it,\" the New York Democrat told reporters staking out the speaker's office. \"And, right now, we're having very good success with it.\"\n\nBut at least five members of Pelosi's leadership team -- four of whom also sit on the House Judiciary Committee -- pressed Pelosi in a closed-door leadership meeting to allow the panel to start an inquiry. Bade and Mike DeBonis report: \"The meeting marks the first time a chairman and top rank-and-file lawmakers ... have lobbied her to change her long-held position on impeachment. Judiciary Committee members for days have discussed how to move the speaker toward their thinking, but few have been willing to break with her publicly. However, a core group of Judiciary Democrats plans to begin calling Tuesday for an impeachment inquiry if [McGahn] does not show for subpoenaed testimony. ...\n\n\"During the Monday night leadership meeting, Pelosi spoke about how Democrats' messaging isn't breaking through because everyone is talking about corruption, [Bob] Mueller's report and impeachment. She bemoaned the fact that last week the investigations were making page one news while the House's passage of the Equality Act -- a bill aimed at ensuring that gay, lesbian and bisexual people are not discriminated against -- was on 'Page 26.' That's when Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), chairman of a Judiciary subcommittee, jumped in to tell Pelosi that it amounted to a good case for launching an impeachment inquiry ... Raskin argued that such an inquiry would allow leadership to streamline and centralize all of the investigations into one. ... 'You want to tell Elijah Cummings to go home?' Pelosi said, referring to the House Oversight and Reform Committee chairman. ...\n\n\"During the leadership meeting, three other Judiciary Committee members -- [Rep. David] Cicilline (D-R.I.), Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and freshman Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) -- backed Raskin. ... Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), a fierce Pelosi defender and ally, grew angry and scolded the lawmakers that an impeachment inquiry would further distract from legislating. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos (Ill.) -- who has argued before that legislators should move on from impeachment talk -- pushed back as well, noting that when the DCCC asked voters in focus groups what topics they cared about, Mueller's inquiry ranked near the bottom.\"\n\n-- Trump relishes a fight and loves a good foil. House Democrats give him both. With his refusal to give an inch, Trump seems to be trying to goad Democrats into taking the next step. The White House is currently blocking more than 20 Democratic investigations into Trump, his finances or his policies.\n\n-- Even if House Democrats do decide to begin impeachment proceedings, a key factor that protects the president from being removed from office is that only one Republican in either chamber of Congress appears anywhere close to advocating his removal from office. Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) drew a primary challenger yesterday after he became the first Republican member of Congress to say publicly that Trump has committed impeachable offenses. The Detroit Free Press's Todd Spangler reports: \"State Rep. Jim Lower, R-Greenville, announced that he would run for the 3rd Congressional District seat Amash has held since 2011 and would forgo a race for a third term in the state House. Lower said he had been planning to run for some time and had expected to make an announcement closer to July 4.\"\n\n-- Amash has put his fellow congressional Republicans in a pickle. DeBonis and Bade report: \"Top Republican lawmakers and aides said Monday that kicking Amash out of the GOP conference or off his committee would only draw more attention to his apostasy. Instead, they have focused on isolating Amash and portraying him as an outlier. The House Freedom Caucus, a conservative group of which Amash is a member, also took a position Monday night 'strongly disagreeing' with Amash's comments.\"\n\n-- Harry Reid, battling pancreatic cancer in Las Vegas, said he shares Pelosi's concerns about political backlash from impeachment. \"Because you don't have to go very far to remember what happened. I mean, Clinton was impeached -- it helped him. I've been saying that for several months,\" the former Senate majority leader told the New York Times's Jonathan Martin. He narrowly held off a challenge in 1998 from John Ensign by 428 votes, perhaps thanks to voter unease with the GOP impeaching Clinton.\n\n\"I believe Jerry Nadler is handling things the right way,\" the 79-year-old added. \"I think the Mueller report deserves a full airing, I think that there should be witnesses, and I think that Trump better be very careful. Because if they're going to order McGahn and Mueller and others not to testify, I think that opens the door to impeachment. ... [The] trigger point is if they try to not allow people to come forward and testify.\"\n\nTHE CASE IS NOT CLOSED:\n\n-- Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, told a House panel earlier this year that Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow encouraged him to lie under oath and claim that negotiations for Trump Tower Moscow ended in January 2016. Tom Hamburger, Ellen Nakashima and Karoun Demirjian report: \"In fact, Cohen later admitted, discussions on the Moscow tower continued into June of the presidential election year, after it was clear Trump would be the GOP nominee. ...\n\n\"House Democrats are now scrutinizing whether Sekulow or other Trump attorneys played a role in shaping Cohen's 2017 testimony to Congress. ... Attorneys for Sekulow said in a statement that 'Cohen's alleged statements are more of the same from him and confirm the observations of prosecutors in the Southern District of New York that Cohen's 'instinct to blame others is strong.' ...\n\n\"Cohen also said he spoke to Sekulow about a potential pardon 'quite a few' times 'before and after' his testimony to the committee. He said Sekulow didn't say directly that the president was considering giving him a pardon, but rather said 'there's always the possibility of a pre-pardon.'\"\n\n-- New York prosecutors are scrutinizing thousands of documents relating to Trump's inauguration. CNN's Kara Scannell reports: \"The President's Inaugural Committee handed over the cache of documents over the course of several weeks in response to a wide-ranging subpoena seeking documents, records, and communications concerning the inaugural's finances, vendors, and donors sent in February by the US attorney's office with the Southern District of New York. The last set of documents was produced within the last month. The end of the document production indicates the investigation is moving into the next stage.\"\n\n-- Sweden formally issued an extradition request for Julian Assange. The WikiLeaks founder is serving time in Britain for skipping bail, but he's wanted in Stockholm to face sexual assault charges. This could set off a tug of war between Sweden and the United States, which wants Assange extradited on allegations of conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer. (AP)\n\n-- Russians seeking to interfere in U.S. elections strategized about how to sow racial discord here as recently as last year, according to newly obtained documents. NBC News's Richard Engel, Kate Benyon-Tinker and Kennett Werner report: \"Communications between associates of Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Kremlin-linked oligarch indicted by [Mueller] for previous influence operations against the U.S. ... laid out a new plot to manipulate and radicalize African-Americans. The plans show that Prigozhin's circle has sought to exploit racial tensions well beyond Russia's social media and misinformation efforts tied to the 2016 election. ... One document said that [Trump's] election had 'deepened conflicts in American society' and suggested that, if successful, the influence project would 'undermine the country's territorial integrity and military and economic potential.'\"\n\nTHE RULE OF LAW:\n\n-- At a rally in Pennsylvania last night, Trump criticized Hillary Clinton. When the crowd began chanting \"Lock her up,\" the president replied: \"We have a great new attorney general who's going to give it a very fair look.\"\n\n-- That attorney general, Bill Barr, insisted in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he's fighting more to protect the institution of the presidency than Trump personally. The Journal's Sadie Gurman reports: \"'I felt the rules were being changed to hurt Trump, and I thought it was damaging for the presidency over the long haul,' Mr. Barr said. ... 'At every grave juncture the presidency has done what it is supposed to do, which is to provide leadership and direction,' he said in an interview. 'If you destroy the presidency and make it an errand boy for Congress, we're going to be a much weaker and more divided nation.' ... Many current and former law-enforcement officials have come to view Mr. Barr skeptically, citing his newly launched review of the investigation's origins and what he termed 'spying' on Trump campaign associates over ties to Russians. He hasn't explained what specifically prompted his concerns.\"\n\n-- Trump also called for the government to investigate Joe Biden's son, Hunter, over his business deals in China during an interview that aired Sunday on Fox News. It's a fresh illustration of the president's personal disdain for the rule of law. The Times's Maggie Haberman, Annie Karni, Ken Vogel and Katie Benner report: \"It was the latest in a long series of statements by Mr. Trump suggesting he would like to see criminal investigations of opponents including Clinton, John Kerry and the Democratic National Committee, and it came as the president seems particularly preoccupied by Mr. Biden's candidacy. ... 'It's a terrible breach of norms for the president to publicly advocate prosecutions of his opponents,' said Jack Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School who was an assistant attorney general during President George W. Bush's first term.\"\n\n-- At his rally in Pennsylvania last night, Trump prosecuted an economic case against Joe Biden. Anne Gearan reports from Montoursville, Pa.: \"The president touted an economic turnaround on his watch, saying Pennsylvania now has historically low unemployment that no political competitor could best. 'Sleepy Joe said that he's running to, quote, \"save the world,\"' Trump said to laughter from supporters. 'Well, he was: He was going to save every country but ours!' Trump's 'Make America Great Again' rally at an airport hangar in this small north-central Pennsylvania town was nominally a show of support for Republican state Rep. Fred Keller, the heavy favorite in a special election Tuesday to fill the congressional seat vacated in January by Tom Marino, a Republican who had just been reelected to his fifth term. ...\n\n\"Trump called a pan-Asia trade deal backed by Biden 'a disaster' for Pennsylvania and singled out remarks Biden recently made about charting a new course with China. Biden has staked much of his early campaign message on the theory that he can deny Trump a repeat victory here. A native of working-class Scranton, more than an hour to the east, Biden inaugurated his 2020 campaign in Pennsylvania and is using Philadelphia as his campaign headquarters. 'Biden deserted you,' Trump said. 'I guess he was born here, but he left you, he left you for another state.'\"\n\n-- Trump remains incredibly popular among blue-collar white workers in northeast Ohio, even though his presidency has not reversed the region's economic decline. The Times's Trip Gabriel has great reporting from the ground: \"The loss of 1,600 jobs in March at a General Motors plant in Lordstown, despite Mr. Trump's visible efforts to save them, was the latest blow. But even though stresses on families and communities are already acute, Mr. Trump appears to have lost little of his blue-collar support here. It is a sign of how tight a bond he has with voters who were once staunch Democrats, in an allegiance as much cultural as economic. But it also undermines the argument of [Biden] that he would be the best nominee to win back Midwest states because of his own appeal to working-class voters.\"\n\n-- Trump is preparing for a jet-setting summer of international travel to show stature on the world stage. The AP's Zeke Miller and Jill Colvin report: \"Four days in Tokyo. Then it's off to see Queen Elizabeth before a jaunt to Normandy, France, and perhaps time in Ireland. A return trip to Japan? Why not. And throw in Seoul. Then it's back to France for Trump for a summit with world leaders. ... The flurry of international travel is a marked change of pace for a president who likes to sleep in his own bed and rarely strays far from the White House unless it's to his own properties. The packed calendar is the product of both a concerted attempt by Trump to wrap himself in the trappings of the presidency heading into re-election season and a fluke of the global summit calendar.\"\n\n-- Despite his role as commander in chief, Trump continues to tweet out his thoughts about the 2020 Democrats like the country's \"narrator in chief.\" Ashley Parker and Robert Costa have a smart piece on how the president is always in your head, no matter if you love him or hate him: \"Trump in recent weeks has weighed in on actor Jussie Smollett's case in Chicago ('It is an embarrassment to our Nation!'), instructed the French government on how to fight the fire that engulfed Paris's Notre Dame Cathedral ('flying water tankers'), and disparaged what he viewed as the 'political correctness' of the Kentucky Derby ('It was a rough & tumble race on a wet and sloppy track'). ... Trump's naked eagerness to make any story or occasion about himself stems from his self-conception as both a star and a producer, a director and a writer, according to friends, advisers and critics. And now, they say, he is able to deploy the platform of the presidency to amplify that vision of himself as a leading man.\"\n\nEARTH IN THE BALANCE:\n\n-- The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution, which would make it easier to roll back key climate change rules. The Times's Lisa Friedman reports: \"The new analytical model would significantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted. ... The five people familiar with the plan, all current or former E.P.A. officials, said the new modeling method would appear in the agency's analysis of the final version of the replacement regulation, known as the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which is expected to be made public in June.\"\n\n-- The EPA is also cutting off funding for several research centers that study the effects of pollution on childhood development. Greenwire's Corbin Hiar and Ariel Wittenberg report: \"The move, critics say, is part of a broader effort by [Trump] to downplay science that could lead to stricter regulations on polluting industries. At issue are 13 Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Centers located at institutions across the country.\"\n\n-- The U.S. government put nuclear waste under a dome in the Marshall Islands. It is now cracking open. The president of the islands, Hilda Heine, is concerned that there's a risk of radioactive materials leaking. (Kyle Swenson)\n\n-- Bayer, Monsanto's new parent company, is facing thousands of new Roundup cancer lawsuits after a $2 billion judgment. Bayer plans on appealing the verdict, which awarded $1 billion each to a couple diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after they used the Roundup herbicide for years. (NBC News)\n\nTHE CHINA THREAT:\n\n-- Chinese leaders are preparing their citizens for a drawn-out trade war with Trump by evoking past battles with the Americans, including their assistance to North Korea during the 1950s. Anna Fifield reports: Chinese President Xi Jinping, \"accompanied by his top trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, on Monday placed a floral basket at a monument in Jiangxi province commemorating the start of the Long March in 1934. In the 4,000-mile, year-long trek, the Communists broke through Nationalist lines, eventually ousting them and installing Mao Zedong as leader of China. Meanwhile, China's main movie channel, CCTV-6, has scrapped its regular programming in favor of films about the Korean War, which ended in a draw after China intervened to fight back the Americans.\"\n\n-- U.S. technology companies started curbing sales to the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. Jeanne Whalen, Greg Bensinger, Ellen Nakashima and Hamza Shaban report: \"Google said it would restrict Huawei's access to future updates of its Android operating software, which powers many of Huawei's phones. Other U.S. manufacturers also began suspending business dealings with the Chinese firm. The markets punished many of those suppliers Monday, including Intel, Broadcom and Qualcomm, as well as Micron and semiconductor manufacturer Cypress. ... On Monday evening, the Commerce Department slightly eased the timing of the restrictions, saying it would allow some transactions to continue for 90 days, to facilitate 'certain activities necessary to the continued operations of existing networks and to support existing mobile services.'\"\n\n-- Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei said the confrontation between the U.S. and China that he's been caught up in was \"inevitable.\" He also said U.S. trade restrictions will not deter Huawei's 5G expansion plans. (South China Morning Post)\n\n-- Morgan Stanley said the collapse of U.S.-Chinese trade talks could push the global economy toward a recession. \"If talks stall, no deal is agreed upon and the U.S. imposes 25% tariffs on the remaining circa $300 billion of imports from China, we see the global economy heading towards recession,\" the bank's analysts said in a note. They added that such circumstances would force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates back to zero within a year. (Reuters)\n\n-- A Ukrainian aircraft engine factory has become the Chinese military's new cash-hungry partner. Anton Troianovski reports: \"The president of a top Ukrainian aerospace company says its new Chinese investors often ask the staff for 'little conversations.' They want to know about record-keeping and planning, the setup of production lines and the interplay between workshops. 'They'll talk for three hours, and the next day, a totally different group of people will come,' said Vyacheslav Boguslayev, whose sprawling Soviet-era company, Motor Sich, is one of the most advanced military aircraft engine manufacturers in the world. ... Racing to upgrade its military, China has been turning to Ukraine. And Ukraine -- with its economy scrambled by hostilities with Russia -- has been willing to accept China's embrace.\"\n\n-- The Department of Homeland Security warned that Chinese-made drones may be sharing sensitive flight data with their manufacturers. An alert from DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warns that the drones \"contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.\" (CNN)\n\n-- Detainees in China's reeducation camps for Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang are given an hour or so to cry every two weeks, according to a woman who was held at one of the facilities. From Radio Free Asia: \"Since April 2017, authorities in the XUAR have held an estimated 1.5 million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities accused of harboring 'strong religious views' and 'politically incorrect' ideas in the camps ... Reporting ... has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination [and] routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers ... Guzire Awulqanqizi, a Kazakh woman who was held at the Dongmehle Re-education Camp [said] that detainees dealing with the stress of 14-hour days of political study are given a 'crying session' every two weeks.\"\n\nTHE IMMIGRATION WARS:\n\n-- Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state who blew a totally winnable governor's race last fall because of his polarizing approach, gave the White House a detailed list of 10 demands for him to become Trump's \"immigration czar.\" The Times's Maggie Haberman and Annie Karni scoop: \"Access to a government jet 24 hours a day. An office in the West Wing, plus guaranteed weekends off for family time. And an assurance of being made secretary of homeland security by November. Those were among a list of 10 conditions ... Kobach also said he would need to be the main television spokesman for the Trump administration on immigration policy. And he said he wanted a guarantee that cabinet secretaries whose portfolios relate to immigration would defer to him, with the president mediating disputes if need be. The list was submitted by Mr. Kobach in recent weeks as he discussed his interest in the job. Other conditions included having a staff of seven reporting to him, 'walk in' privileges to the Oval Office, a security detail if deemed necessary and the title of assistant to the president. ... The existence of the list has become known among officials in the Trump administration, some of whom were taken aback by what they regard as its presumptuousness. Mr. Trump has also been considering others for the role, and he is said to be leaning toward Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the former Virginia attorney general. Mr. Cucinelli has made his own requests related to the job, such as a security detail and transportation to work.\"\n\n-- A 16-year-old Guatemalan boy detained at the southern border died while in U.S. custody in Texas. Abigail Hauslohner reports: \"Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez was found unresponsive in his detention cell 'during a welfare check' Monday, a day after a nurse practitioner had diagnosed him with Influenza A and Border Patrol officials had moved to isolate him from other detained migrants, a CBP official told reporters during a conference call. ... He is the fifth migrant child since December to die after being taken into custody at the southern border by federal immigration authorities.\"\n\n-- New documents show that immigrants detained by ICE are sometimes placed in solitary confinement for reasons unrelated to rule violations. NBC News's Hannah Rappleye, Andrew W. Lehren, Spencer Woodman and Vanessa Swales report: \"The newly-obtained documents paint a disturbing portrait of a system where detainees are sometimes forced into extended periods of isolation for reasons that have nothing to do with violating any rules. ... Only half of the cases involved punishment for rule violations. The other half were unrelated to disciplinary concerns -- they involve the mentally ill, the disabled or others who were sent to solitary largely for what ICE described as safety reasons.\"\n\n-- Meanwhile, down under, Australia's reelection of its conservative government has triggered a spate of suicide attempts among the country's refugees. From France 24: \"Many had prayed for a more lenient policy from Labor, who had been strongly tipped to win. But an unexpected victory by Scott Morrison's centre-right coalition ... dashed hopes and set off a wave of self-harm including several hospitalisations.\"\n\nALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN AND WOMEN:\n\n-- George Papadopoulos, a member of Trump's 2016 campaign, is a perfect metaphor for 2019. T.A. Frank profiles him for this Sunday's Washington Post Magazine: \"I first met George Papadopoulos, the unlikely trigger of an investigation that many thought would take down Donald Trump, on a balmy California day in December 2018, less than a week after his release from federal prison. ... His 12 days in prison, he said, were worst before the fact. The reality of minimum-security confinement came as a relief. 'You're expecting you're going in to get raped and killed,' he said. 'I get inside the prison, and the guards are basically mocking my sentence: 'You're more trouble for us than we are for you.'\u2009' ... In person, he came across as warm, oddly guileless and eager to please. He made boastful claims. ('I was on a first-name basis with Netanyahu for four years.') He made ingratiating claims. ('As an individual I'm more comfortable with Washington Post people like you than with, I dunno, the Daily Caller.') And then there was his central claim: that the entire federal investigation of Trump had its origins in dirty tricks masterminded by a group of foreign and U.S. intelligence entities.\"\n\n-- \"Fox & Friends\" co-host Pete Hegseth privately lobbied Trump to pardon U.S. servicemen accused and convicted of war crimes. Hegseth, an Iraq War veteran, has pressed the president to pardon the men since as early as January. (The Daily Beast)\n\n-- Former Trump associate Roger Stone wants a judge's permission to appear at a strip club in Tennessee where he is scheduled to judge a national exotic dancer competition. Mother Jones's Dan Friedman reports: \"On Thursday, lawyers for Roger Stone, whose travel is restricted ahead of his November trial on obstruction of justice and perjury charges, requested a judge's permission to visit Tennessee and Illinois 'for business opportunities.' ... In a Facebook post, the club said Stone will judge dancers alongside Kristin Davis, who is known as the 'Manhattan Madam' for her role running a high-end prostitution ring in New York City in the early 2000s. Stone has previously employed Davis, and they are close friends. ... Last week, he launched a 'Family Support Fund' to seek donations to cover 'rent, food, medical expenses, insurance, gasoline, and the most basic of living expenses' for him and his wife. Strip-club appearance fees may be an emerging source of income for the cash-strapped dirty trickster.\"\n\n-- Education Secretary Betsy DeVos used her personal email to conduct government business. Laura Meckler reports: \"The report found fewer than 100 emails sent or received to personal accounts between Jan. 20, 2017 ... and April 10, 2018. It said most messages were in the first six months of 2017, from a single writer offering advice on potential candidates for agency positions. The writer, who was not identified, also included other department employees on his or her messages, using their official government email addresses. ... The report also flagged the department's failure to produce emails from DeVos's private accounts in response to one request under the Freedom of Information Act. ... A department spokeswoman, Liz Hill, did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but she said on Twitter that any coverage of the matter was overblown.\"\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Iran has quadrupled its uranium-enrichment production capacity. The AP's Nasser Karimi and Jon Gambrell report: \"Iranian officials made a point to stress that the uranium would be enriched only to the 3.67% limit set under the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, making it usable for a power plant but far below what's needed for an atomic weapon. But by increasing production, Iran soon will exceed the stockpile limitations set by the accord. Tehran has set a July 7 deadline for Europe to set new terms for the deal, or it will enrich closer to weapons-grade levels in a Middle East already on edge.\"\n\n-- Trump said there's \"no indication\" of threatening actions by Tehran, playing down tensions with Iran. Felicia Sonmez reports: \"'We have no indication that anything's happened or will happen, but if it does, it will be met, obviously, with great force. We will have no choice,' [he said]. Trump's description of Iran's recent actions stood somewhat in contrast with the portrayal given by his national security team. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in a tweet earlier Monday that Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, had warned about 'escalating tensions' with Iran.\"\n\n-- Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif dismissed Trump's \"genocidal taunts.\" From the BBC: \"Mr Zarif said the US president should look to history. 'Iranians have stood tall for millennia while aggressors all gone... Try respect - it works!' ... Writing on Twitter on Monday, Iran's foreign minister said the US president was being 'goaded' by what he called the 'B Team' -- a reference to [Bolton], Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.\"\n\n-- Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that, while he favors talks and diplomacy, the current conditions do not allow for them. \"Today's situation is not suitable for talks and our choice is resistance only,\" the Iranian state news agency IRNA quoted Rouhani as saying. (Reuters)\n\n-- Another senior Iranian official called Trump a \"crazy president\" while slamming his mixed messages over any potential conflict. CNN's Nicole Gaouette reports: \"Iran's director of foreign affairs for the country's parliament, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian ... pointed to the US leader's ongoing campaign to strangle Iran's economy on the one hand and his requests for Iran to talk on the other. 'In his mind, Trump thinks he has a gun to Iran's head with sanctions and he is trying to shut down our economy,' Amir-Abdollahian told CNN's Fred Pleitgen. 'This is all in his imagination. Now he wants us to call him? This is a crazy president!'\"\n\n-- Swamp watch: The Libyan National Army, a militia group led by Khalifa Haftar, has hired its own Washington lobbyist. From Politico's Theodoric Meyer: \"Stephen Payne and Brian Ettinger of Linden Government Solutions will lobby in Washington on behalf of Haftar's forces as well as assist with 'international coalition building' and public relations. ... The one-year contract, which will be filed with the Justice Department, is worth $2 million.

And the candidates are in the same position as the rest of the country, not to mention the Murdoch family who controls the network, and even the president of the United States: What to do about Fox News? ... Trump does his best to support the Fox News hosts who support him. ... Meanwhile, Democratic candidates have taken very different approaches to the network. In March, the Democratic National Committee barred Fox News from hosting a Democratic primary. But many candidates, such as [Pete] Buttigieg, are breaking from the party line and going on Fox, each in his or her own way.\"\n\n-- A host of \"Fox & Friends\" slammed Buttigieg for criticizing Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham. The Times's Michael M. Grynbaum reports: \"Mr. Buttigieg's hourlong appearance spawned headlines, solid ratings, and kudos from liberals pleased to see the South Bend, Ind., mayor calling out Fox News pundits on their own network. The reaction was chillier among some of the network's core conservative viewers ... On Monday's 'Fox & Friends,' the host Brian Kilmeade scolded Mr. Buttigieg for criticizing his fellow commentators. ... 'Don't hop on our channel and continue to put down the other hosts on the channel,' Mr. Kilmeade said. 'If you feel that negative about it, don't come. For him to go out there and take shots on our prime-time lineup, without going on our prime-time lineup, shows to me absolutely no courage.'\"\n\n-- Black voters say they are struggling with cynicism toward the field of candidates after they've been let down so many times. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: \"Interviews with dozens of black voters in three competitive states -- Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina -- found deep divisions beneath that party loyalty about the best way to wield the power they bring to the ballot box, and a sense that past political engagement has been met with broken promises and little progress for struggling communities. In addition to regional and generational divides, voters' perceptions are further muddied by the fact that there are nearly two dozen major candidates, including six women and two black senators -- minority candidates who have to contend with the disappointment of some black voters who feel the first black president didn't do enough for them.\"\n\n-- Walmart employees brought a surprise guest to their company's annual meeting as they continue fighting for higher wages and better benefits: Bernie Sanders. Abha Bhattarai reports: \"The presidential candidate, who has repeatedly called on Walmart to improve its working conditions, is heading to Bentonville, Ark., on June 5 to introduce a shareholders' proposal that would give hourly Walmart workers a seat on the company's board. 'These workers need and deserve a seat at the table,' Sanders (I-Vt.) told The Washington Post.

It's easy to assume that the solution is to wall ourselves off, to draw apart. If, ultimately, other people pose the greatest threat to my person and my property, perhaps I should distance myself from them. Jewish legal sources -- including the Mishnah, and the later rabbinic elaborations in the Talmud -- have a lot to say about restitution for damages. Nowhere, however, does Jewish law recommend living in isolation. Community is essential to being a Jew, because community is essential to being a human. We need one another. When we live in close proximity, we will inevitably cause damage to our neighbors, whether with our words or our actions, and we lay ourselves open to being damaged in turn.

Farmers who had been hiding from law enforcement for years were asked to present themselves to authorities and to comply with new commercial-growing ordinances. ... Before legalization, people grew cannabis however they could and developed methods to avoid getting caught by law enforcement. Regulation demands a different set of skills. Instead of burning records, farmers must now practice accounting. ... Legalization brings with it the costs of taxes, permitting, compliance, and new competitors. It has also occasioned a rapid drop in price. Now Humboldt County is experiencing not only an economic crisis but also an existential one. What happens to a group of people whose anti-government ethos was sustained by an illegal plant that is now the most regulated crop in California?\"\n\n-- The Economist, \"Europe's hard-right is pitching voters a contradictory fantasy\": \"Europe's right-wing populists will take votes off an array of mainstream rivals at next weekend's election to the European Parliament.

Under sporadic rain showers in the shadow of the city's cathedral, right-populist leaders from eleven EU countries demanded a 'revolution' to overthrow the existing order in Brussels and build a 'Europe of nations'. They were confident. They were loud. They reaped the applause of thousands of supporters of Italy's hard-right Lega, the host party, gathered in the square waving giant flags in the drizzle.

Laura Vozzella reports: \"While a spate of states have recently made access to abortion more difficult, advocates in Virginia are trying to make it easier. The case is being heard in an election year when Republicans are trying to hold onto their razor-thin control of the legislature and when abortion politics -- dormant for the past few cycles -- probably will be prominent. ... The case in federal court in Richmond comes after Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio banned abortions after doctors can detect a fetal heartbeat ... The lawsuit was brought by a coalition of abortion rights groups, including the Center for Reproductive Rights, the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood and several abortion clinics across the state. The state Department of Health and the office of Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D) are defending the rules. The case has put Herring in an awkward position as both an advocate for abortion rights and the state official tasked with defending Virginia law. He did not formally recuse his office from the case but hired a private firm, Hirschler Law, saying he did not have enough staff to handle it.\"\n\n-- A series of shootings in Columbia Heights led to a school lockdown. Peter Hermann reports: \"Liane Carrascoso was headed to pick up her 5-year-old son at Harriet Tubman Elementary School in Columbia Heights on Friday when she saw police officers urgently closing down nearby streets. Two men had been shot less than 400 feet from the school's front door, and officers were searching for three possible shooters. Classes had ended about an hour earlier, but children still mingled on the playground in an aftercare program, waiting to be picked up. Carrascoso said teachers told her that one of the shooters had run right by the playground. 'I saw his teachers, and they looked worried,' she said.

He said he had used a milkshake simply because it had been in his hand at the time. The moment was captured on video and quickly spread on social media. A day later, in a different city in northern England, Mr. Robinson was again splattered with milkshake.\n\nCarl Benjamin, a member of the right-wing U.K. Independence Party who is under investigation about a comment he made on Twitter regarding raping a female Labour lawmaker, was later targeted. He has been hit with four separate milkshake attacks so far.\n\nOther attacks on the far right have been encouraged on social media with the hashtag #SplashTheFash. The practice has prompted an angry backlash from some rightists.\n\n\"Just to be clear, anyone that comes at me with a milkshake will need the straw to eat their meals for the next few months,\" Mark Meechan, another UKIP candidate, wrote on Twitter this month.\n\nThe attacks have also caught the eye of the police. In preparation for a weekend rally for Mr. Farage in Edinburgh, officers have asked McDonald's to briefly stop selling milkshakes on Saturday, a spokeswoman for the fast food chain said.\n\nBut why milkshakes?\n\nKevin Featherstone, a professor of European politics at the London School of Economics, said in an email that the strong visual impact was important.\n\n\"The recipient looks ridiculous and it debunks the politician's aura,\" he said. \"The attacker is saying, 'You don't represent me, with your darker side of politics.' \"\n\nBenjamin Franks, a senior lecturer of social and political philosophy at the university of Glasgow, said in an email that, while he doubted that the original dousing had been planned, the practice had quickly taken off.\n\n\"I think it latterly caught the imagination of anti-fascist protesters because, as there is an abundance of fast food outlets in U.K. cities, it is easily available and -- at least at first -- could be carried without raising suspicion,\" he said.\n\nMilk has been adopted by some white supremacists as a symbol of their movement, but Mr. Franks said that the protesters' actions had effectively turned that notion on its head.\n\n\"It turns a symbol used by the alt right -- milk -- to symbolize 'whiteness' and to mock ethnic groups with a greater predisposition to lactose intolerance, into an image of dramatic opposition,\" Mr. Franks said.\n\nUnlike some of the other politicians targeted, Mr. Farage, who has spent 20 years as a member of the European Parliament, is one of the most recognizable faces in the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union. The Brexit Party is currently leading the polls in Britain for the elections to the European Parliament.\n\nAfter he was doused, Mr. Farage blamed \"radicalized\" Britons who disagreed with Brexit for making normal campaigning impossible.\n\nAnd many have argued that attacking a candidate with food created an atmosphere of aggression and was an inadequate response to the polarizing politics of Mr. Farage.\n\nBrendan Cox, the husband of Jo Cox -- a member of the British Parliament who was killed in a 2016 attack -- said that, while he disagreed with Mr. Farage's politics and his \"willingness to pander to hatred,\" throwing milkshakes was not the answer.\n\n\"I don't think throwing stuff at politicians you disagree with is a good idea,\" he wrote on Twitter, adding that it normalized violence and intimidation.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "iliana_magra@nytimes.com", "name": "Iliana Magra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/21/world/21mikshake/21mikshake-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800026", "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 296142600}, {"uri": "1141390157", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "12:06:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T12:06:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5254902243614197, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-finance-202/2019/05/21/the-finance-202-democrats-probing-trump-deutsche-bank-see-new-momentum/5ce2dd25a7a0a435cff8c0ea/", "title": "Analysis | The Finance 202: Democrats probing Trump, Deutsche Bank see new momentum", "body": "Congressional Democrats -- with new momentum in their legal fight to investigate President Trump's conduct and records -- are pressing Deutsche Bank for more information on a report that the firm ignored red flags about suspicious activity from the Trump and Kushner organizations. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner is now a senior White House adviser.\n\nThe development brings even more political heat to the only major financial firm willing to bank Trump over the past two decades as he suffered a series of bankruptcies and defaults -- and which still holds $300 million in outstanding debt from the now-president. Deutsche Bank also faced enormous fines -- $700 million in 2017 alone -- for money laundering and misconduct on behalf of clients. Its shares hit a record low on Monday.\n\nDemocrats on the Senate Banking Committee plan to press the issue with federal financial regulators at a hearing today. Ohio's Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the panel, and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) set the stage in a Monday letter to Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing asking for details about events described in a New York Times report from Sunday.\n\nThat story alleges that over 2016 and 2017, Deutsche's in-house anti-money-laundering experts recommended passing suspicious transactions involving Trump and Kushner-controlled entities along to the Treasury Department for further investigation. But executives in the bank's private wealth management division buried the reports instead.\n\nBrown plans to lead off his questioning today of the Treasury Department's top financial crimes enforcer and the FBI's section chief for financial crimes by highlighting the report.\n\n\"We need to get to the bottom of what happened here,\" Brown will say, according to a copy of his opening statement shared with The Finance 202. \"Everyone has to follow anti-money laundering laws and rules -- you don't get an exemption if you have a rich and powerful client. And we have to hold financial institutions accountable if they break the rules.\"\n\nAnd House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who along with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) last month subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for records relating to its extensive dealings with Trump, did not have a comment by press time.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have some wind at their backs as they press their case. A federal judge on Monday blocked Trump's bid to kill another House subpoena -- this one to his accounting firm, Mazars USA, for years of his financial records. In a forceful ruling, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta wrote it is \"not for the court to question whether the [House Oversight and Reform] Committee's actions are truly motivated by political considerations,\" and declined a request from Trump's lawyers to stay his order for more than seven days.\n\nTrump criticized the ruling:\n\nA federal judge in Manhattan could follow suit Wednesday when he holds a hearing on a similar attempt by the Trump team to block House subpoenas of Deutsche Bank and Capital One. Trump's lawyers have made the same argument there that fell short in the Mazars case: That Democratic lawmakers behind the document demands are motivated by improper political considerations.\n\n(Still, House Democratic leaders are divided over how, broadly, to approach attempting to hold Trump to account. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) faced down a number of her lieutenants eager to begin impeachment proceedings in a heated Monday night meeting, after the White House blocked former counsel Don McGahn from testifying to the House.)\n\nThe New York Times report prompted an angry response from Trump on Monday -- but not over the story's central claim that Deutsche Bank overlooked potentially shady transactions involving Trump entities. He bristled rather at the story's statement that the German bank has been the only major financial firm willing to extend him credit:\n\nThe New York Times reporter who wrote the Deutsche Bank piece challenged Trump's claim:\n\nTrump's tweet thread belongs to a tradition of defensive comments about his net worth, as The Post's Catherine Rampell points out. \"One theory is that, maybe, if Trump's tax returns or other financial records become public, his supporters would learn that he's not nearly as rich as he says,\" she writes. \"Another is that his finances are not exactly on the up and up. Of course, both explanations could be true.\"\n\nFor its part, Deutsche Bank released a statement Monday denying the Times report. \"At no time was an investigator prevented from escalating activity identified as potentially suspicious. Furthermore, suggestion that anyone was reassigned or fired in an effort to quash concerns relating to any client is categorically false,\" the bank said.\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that the whistleblower at the heart of the Times story never made the first claim the denial addresses. Rather, she says, she presented her best case for submitting a report to Treasury on the suspicious activity she uncovered, but senior executives with the bank's private banking division decided against her recommendation.\n\nNow, Congressional Democrats intend to pick up where those executives left off.\n\n-- Powell raises concern about business debt. The WSJ's Nick Timiraos and Andrew Ackerman: \"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said financial regulators must take seriously potential dangers that rising levels of business debt pose to the U.S. economy but said some comparisons to last decade's subprime-mortgage bubble overstate the risks... Views about the risks from rising corporate borrowing 'range from \"This is a return to the subprime-mortgage crisis\" to \"Nothing to worry about here,\"' said Mr. Powell. 'At the moment, the truth is likely somewhere in the middle.'\"\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\n-- China talks stall: Both the U.S. and China appear to be digging in for a prolonged trade war. To review: Since Trump and his administration accused China of backing away from a deal, the United States has doubled tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports; China has promised to retaliate with tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. goods by June 1; the United States is considering imposing tariffs on all remaining approximately $300 billion in Chinese imports not currently taxed; and at the end of last week, it sought to blacklist Huawei, one of China's leading technology companies. Meanwhile, the promise of talks have fizzled.\n\nDavid Dollar, senior fellow in the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution, broke down for Brent why he thinks the two sides are still so far away from a deal.\n\n... But while prospects with China sour, USMCA talks are looking slightly more promising. Trump announced on Friday that the United States would lift its steel and aluminum tariffs, which Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) had said was necessary before the Senate Finance Committee that he chairs moved forward on the New NAFTA.\n\n-- Justice Department reportedly leaning against T-Mobile takeover: \"The Justice Department is leaning against approving T-Mobile U.S. Inc.'s proposed takeover of Sprint Corp., according to a person familiar with the review, even after the companies won the backing of the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission,\" Bloomberg News's David McLaughlin reports.\n\n\"Opposition to the deal by the Justice Department's antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, would mark a rare break with the FCC. The two agencies work side by side on merger reviews and typically emerge on the same page about whether to approve deals.\"\n\n-- Ford to cut 10 percent of global workforce: \"Ford Motor Co. will cut roughly 10 percent of its global salaried staff by August as part of a companywide \"redesign,\" the company told employees Monday,\" my colleague Rachel Siegel reports. \"The move will eliminate 7,000 white-collar jobs and save the U.S. auto giant about $600 million a year.\"\n\n\"The cuts represent the latest phase of Ford's global restructuring, meant to make the company more agile and less bureaucratic in the face of industry tumult that has forced carmakers to pivot away from sedans and shutter plants nationwide.\"\n\n-- Top four congressional leaders head to the White House: \"The four top party leaders will meet on Tuesday morning to begin talks on a potential deal to raise the budget caps, as well as a possible boost to the debt ceiling, according to multiple sources, although any agreement will be hard to reach,\" Politico's John Bresnahan and Heather Caygle report. \"Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will attend the session, as well as their top aides.\"\n\n\"Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Acting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will take the lead for the Trump administration in the negotiations, the sources added. Without action by Congress and the White House, the Pentagon faces a cut of $71 billion under current law, while domestic programs would be slashed $55 billion.\"\n\n-- Harris announces gender pay gap plan: \"Senator Kamala Harris of California on Monday announced a proposal to close the gender wage gap by requiring larger companies to certify that men and women are paid equally, in an effort to combat wage discrimination on a federal level,\" the New York Times's Astead W. Herndon reports.\n\n\"Unlike previous federal legislation regarding the pay gap, which asked workers to report or sue their employer if discrepancies were suspected, Ms. Harris's plan would proactively force companies with 100 or more employees to obtain an \"equal pay certification\" every two years, showing that they were paying men and women the same for analogous work, her campaign said.\"\n\n-- Crowley, Daschle join cannabis company board: \"Northern Swan Holdings Inc., an investment firm betting on hemp and marijuana cultivation in Colombia, has enlisted a pair of former Democratic lawmakers as it tries to navigate complicated cannabis regulations around the globe,\" Bloomberg News's Craig Giammona reports. \"Joe Crowley, a former high-ranking New York congressman who lost a primary to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last year, and Tom Daschle, a former U.S. Senate majority leader from South Dakota, have joined Northern Swan's advisory board, the latest politicians to jump into the legal cannabis industry.\"\n\n-- Regulators leave almost half their fines uncollected. WSJ's Dave Michaels: \"Wall Street watchdogs often tout the fines they levy on alleged wrongdoers. Yet much of that money is never collected. The Securities and Exchange Commission over five fiscal years that ended in September 2018 took in 55% of the $20 billion in enforcement fines set through settlements or court judgments, according to agency statistics. During the prior five years, from 2009 through 2013, the SEC collected on 60% of $14.6 billion...\n\n\"The SEC has struggled for years to get defendants to pay their fines, although some are almost certain to avoid payment forever... The SEC's challenge is that, like companies that are owed money, it doesn't have the right to seize a debtor's property or assets to extract payment. Instead, it relies on a time-consuming and litigious process of filing liens against defendants or going to court to seek contempt orders.\"\n\nBrexit Party Leader Nigel Farage was doused in milkshake while trying to campaign", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/7927c55249ae4fc7f10dee4f822a2722-4850-3233-70-8-J4J5H7S4UEI6TBBNPU7NP2ZZK4.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4798677", "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 296136360}, {"uri": "1141352956", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "11:21:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T11:21:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/21/why-we-google-moving-other-countries-when-party-we-dont-like-wins/", "title": "Analysis | Why we google moving to other countries when the party we don't like wins", "body": "By Rick Noack Rick Noack Foreign affairs reporter focusing on Europe and international security May 21 at 6:58 AM\n\nLate on Saturday came the announcement that crushed Australian liberals' dreams of returning to power. Defying all expectations and polls, the center-right administration of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison managed to hold onto power, echoing the surprise victory of President Trump in 2016.\n\nBeyond the unreliability of polls, there was another echo of 2016.\n\nAfter Trump's victory, disappointed Democrats eager to leave the country crashed the Canadian immigration website.\n\nAlmost three years on, the same could be observed on the other side of the world on Sunday, hours after the conservative win in Australia. In New Zealand, where Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has managed to position herself as a global liberal role model despite governing a country with a population smaller than London's, government servers registered a surge in interest to migrate there over the weekend.\n\nThe site had more than 11,000 visitors on Sunday, compared to less than 3,000 visitors seven days earlier, according to officials. Google analytics showed a surge in related search queries in Australia.\n\nThose seeking a way out were in luck, as migrating to New Zealand isn't much more difficult for Australians than it is for Americans to go to Europe on vacation. \"If you are a citizen or permanent resident of Australia you don't need to apply for a visa to live and work in New Zealand,\" the country's immigration website states.\n\nThis almost certainly wasn't news to most Australians.\n\nIt also is unlikely that the surge in traffic will indeed translate into a substantial rise in Australians moving to New Zealand, as the U.S. elections have previously proved: Whereas announcing the imminent departure for Canada on social media was a largely effortless move for many, actually moving to Canada was not as big of a trend. Rather than causing a surge in U.S. migrants to Canada, the Trump victory only resulted in a temporary uptick.\n\nInformation snippets, such as one day of search traffic, shouldn't be overinterpreted.\n\nAnother cautionary tale was Britons' rush to google \"What is the E. U.?,\" hours after the country had voted to leave the European Union. To Brexit's opponents, the anecdote served as evidence that few supporters of leaving the E.U. knew what they were getting themselves into at the time of the vote. But British E.U. opponents would have cautioned that a few thousands of Britons taking to Google may make for an online trend, but that it was at best a nonrepresentative, minor detail -- and at worst a misleading effort to portray Brexit voters as unintelligent and unprepared.\n\nThe Internet, those critics maintained, had provided E.U. supporters with the tale they wanted to hear.\n\nWhile temporary spikes in online search behavior provide limited insights, the debate they cause can often be more telling.\n\nIn that context, last weekend's New Zealand immigration episode may be less an indication of a wave of Australians moving to New Zealand, and more a metaphorical expression of the extent of liberal Australians' frustration with their government -- and their hopes for a Jacinda Ardern-style challenger.\n\nThe differences between Morrison and Ardern could hardly be more pronounced.\n\nMorrison has portrayed himself as a defender of the country's influential coal industry and has resisted calls to cut emissions more significantly. He has largely shrugged off climate action protests.\n\nGiven that Australia's agricultural heartland -- long a conservative stronghold -- is now the most severely affected by climate change-induced droughts, liberals expected a growing momentum for their anti-coal calls there. But so far, few farmers see climate change as the reason for the record droughts that are threatening their livelihoods, even as researchers maintain that Australia has already heated up by 1 degree Celsius over the last century.\n\nIn comparison, liberal Ardern has pursued a more far reaching climate change policy, banning all new offshore oil exploration last spring as part of an effort to make the country carbon neutral.\n\nWhereas Ardern's government has just rolled out the world's first so-called well-being budget -- focused on improving citizens' happiness instead of growing GDP -- Australia's conservatives mostly ran on the promise to preserve economic growth. The liberal opposition Labor Party had campaigned for a more New Zealand-style approach, favoring high taxes to address social inequality.\n\nAnother difference between the two parties was their stance on immigration, with the conservatives pursuing tougher policies, including continuing to hold refugees in offshore centers, where several people tried to commit suicide after Saturday's election result was announced, according to AFP.\n\nUnable to elect a government that vowed to change course, some of Australia's liberals instead began to explore options to become migrants themselves on Sunday.\n\nWhile New Zealand officials said they did not expect most of them to be serious, the 2020 U.S. elections could become another test of whether Democrats are willing to keep living in a country run by a president they deem abhor.\n\n'Complete shock': Australia's prime minister holds onto power, defying election predictions\n\n10 key lessons from Australia's poll-defying election results", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AHyzfOAltqHwISETJWQQBGOIG7s=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WOOTH2DZ5QI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 296133660}, {"uri": "1141282981", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "09:49:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T09:49:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/realestate/visas-residency-passports-property-investment.html", "title": "Special Incentive for Property Buyers: A Foreign Passport", "body": "When Natalia Yavorska and her husband first considered buying a holiday retreat somewhere warmer than their Ukrainian homeland, they were drawn to the Canary Islands.\n\nA vacation to the Spanish archipelago in 2012 left them eyeing land on the southwest coast of the island of Tenerife, and while the initial attractions were the golf courses and ocean views, the deal was sealed by a special extra that came with their purchase.\n\n\"The fact that we could get a Spanish residence visa from buying real estate was very important, and that made it an easy decision,\" said Ms. Yavorska, a 60-year-old former banker from a town near Kiev.\n\nThat \"golden visa\" carried the right to eventually apply for a Spanish, and therefore European Union, passport, the kind of bonus that is luring a growing number of investors to high-end real estate.\n\nOnce seen as a slightly shady practice, the business of dangling visas and citizenship in front of wealthy investors has become a more common, and in some cases hugely successful, marketing strategy.\n\nMs. Yavorska and her husband, Alexander Yavorski, who own a pharmaceutical import business in Ukraine, were worried about political stability at home and saw the right to live in the European Union as \"a type of insurance.\"\n\n\"Something can always happen between Russia and Ukraine, so if you have the chance to have a visa or a second passport sitting in your drawer, you would be stupid not to take it,\" she said.\n\nSo far, at least 14 countries have programs that offer visas or passports to foreigners who buy real estate, according to research by Henley & Partners, a British-based law firm that specializes in helping people looking such programs, and The New York Times. Montenegro will soon become the 15th, and the British overseas territory of Anguilla is planning to follow suit.\n\nMany more countries, including the United States and 20 of the 28 European Union members, are offering residence visas, which can often lead to passports, to foreigners willing to invest in nonproperty business ventures. These countries believe the investments will bolster their economies.\n\nOther countries, led by small Caribbean island nations and Vanuatu, in the South Pacific, are happy to simply sell a passport for as little as $100,000.\n\nAnalysts say that offers of passports and residency have become a big business, attracting an estimated $20 billion a year in investment.\n\nThat approach is transforming the upper end of real estate markets and reshaping the finances of some of the smaller countries, pumping billions of dollars into economies that are desperate for the funds.\n\nAt the same time, the practice is raising fears in the European Parliament and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which works to promote economic growth worldwide. They worry that the programs could assist money laundering, tax evasion and the free movement of criminals and terrorists, as well as allow wealthy Russians, Iranians and Syrians to skirt economic sanctions.\n\nThere are eight countries -- five small Caribbean states, Turkey and, in the European Union, Cyprus and Malta -- that will hand over passports to property buyers, who are generally required to spend little, if any, time within their borders.\n\nIn December, Brazil joined Dubai, which is part of the United Arab Emirates, and six European nations -- Cyprus, Greece, Latvia, Malta, Portugal and Spain -- in extending residence visas to property buyers.\n\nThe rules vary for converting those visas into passports.\n\nPortugal requires a waiting period of five years, during which the applicant needs to spend just one week a year in the country. Spain and Latvia insist on a 10-year wait. The Latvians and Greeks require difficult language tests and several years of actually living in the country, and the Latvians insist that applicants learn the national anthem. Dubai almost never grants United Arab Emirates citizenship to foreigners.\n\nThe picky passport shopper needs to consider price, each country's tax system and the speed of its bureaucracy: Dominica is the fastest to hand over a passport, and Turkey the slowest among nations that go straight to a passport.\n\nPassport shoppers also need to consider how much time a nation requires them to spend within its borders, and how many other countries will grant them visa-free access with their new passports. Grenada, for instance, offers passports that have visa-free access to both China and Russia.\n\nWealthy Chinese are by far the biggest buyers of both visas and passports, followed by Russians, experts say. There is also growing interest among French citizens eager to avoid high income taxes and Britons desperate to maintain their European Union membership when or if their country leaves the bloc.\n\n\"I think there will be a huge amount of activity once we know what is actually happening with Brexit,\" said Penny Mosgrove, the chief executive of the upmarket real estate agency Quintessentially Estates.\n\nAmericans are interested, too. In the five years to April 2018, 4,327 United States citizens received golden visas in Spain alone. Experts say there are two reasons for Americans' appetite for new passports and residency visas.\n\nOne is that the United States and Eritrea are the only countries that tax the worldwide earnings of their citizens even if they live abroad.\n\nAlex Marino, who heads one of the largest expatriation legal practices in the world for Moodys Gartner Tax Law, said that in the final quarter of 2016, when Donald J. Trump was elected president, there was a record spike in the number of Americans renouncing their United States citizenship. But the biggest driving force by far, he said, \"is finances and taxes, rather than politics.\"\n\nPeter Vincent, a former senior prosecutor in the Obama administration who now oversees security liaison for Henley & Partners, the law firm, said another factor was personal security.\n\n\"There are some places in the world where if your taxi or bus gets pulled up and you are carrying a U.S. passport, that is a death warrant,\" he said, \"so people prefer to have a second passport for safety reasons.\"\n\nKnight Frank, a British real estate consulting firm that operates globally, estimated late last year that 36 percent of people with more than $30 million in net assets had second passports, up from 34 percent a year earlier.\n\nChristian H. K\u00e4lin, the Swiss-born lawyer who leads the British-based Henley & Partners, said the trend was also growing among the less wealthy.\n\nFor those seeking residency visas or passports, the firm charges fees that start at about 20,000 euros, or $22,500, and can reach \u20ac500,000 for complicated programs like that of Austria, which requires nonproperty investments of at least \u20ac10 million. The firm has grown rapidly over the past decade, expanding to 30 offices around the world.\n\nCharlie Smith, European adviser at the New York company Concierge Auctions, which specializes in properties valued at more than $2 million, said the lure of a visa is an important marketing tool. Mr. Smith used a recent tour of China and Singapore to drum up interest in the auction of the nine-bedroom Villa San Lorenzo in Quinta do Lago, a gated community in the Algarve region of Portugal. The property was previously listed for \u20ac20 million.\n\nMr. Smith said that he had \"specifically targeted\" his customer databases in China with the property because China is the strongest market for Portugal's golden visa program. In the 12 months ended in February, 4,159 Chinese used the program, a 30 percent increase over the previous year and well ahead of second-place Brazil, with 695 investors.\n\nSome developers are making the residency programs an integral part of their plans, shaping their prices and timelines around the best way to qualify for visas. When the high-end property consulting firm Athena Advisers ran a promotion for several Portuguese developments at its London offices in March, it flew in developers from Lisbon to pitch their projects, and lawyers to explain how the investments could qualify for the golden visa program.\n\nOver red wine and finger food, an audience of about 20 potential buyers asked questions that focused as much on the golden visas as on the likely rental and investment returns of the projects.\n\nS\u00e9rgio Ferreira, the chief executive of the developer Coporgest, explained how a 43-apartment project in central Lisbon had been structured to take maximum advantage of the visa system.\n\nThe project, SottoMayor Premium, involves the renovation of a 19th-century building so buyers can qualify for a \u20ac350,000 threshold, rather than the normal minimum investment of \u20ac500,000.\n\nUnusually, some sales of the apartments, which are priced from \u20ac420,000 to \u20ac1.6 million, have been packaged as interest-paying special-purpose vehicles designed with the visa in mind.\n\nAs soon as an investor makes an initial payment of \u20ac350,000, the clock starts on the five-year waiting period for a full passport, even though the apartment might not be completed for another two or three years.\n\nJo\u00e3o Cunha Vaz, a senior partner with the law firm Edge, briefed Athena's clients on the visa program and several tax-reducing programs offered by Portugal, including the \"non-habitual resident\" option, which offers a decade of tax breaks and has been attracting French citizens and other foreigners.\n\nAnother country that has recently developed a visa program is Brazil, which in the past saw many of its citizens moving money abroad to obtain second passports. Now, it is trying to reverse the trend.\n\nEdouard Barthelemy, Athena's manager in Rio de Janeiro, says the program is too new to have yielded results. But he is confident it will build interest in high-end properties.\n\nNot everyone is pleased with the growth of visa programs.\n\nCritics say that while countries like Cyprus and Malta are reaping the benefits of handing out passports, what they are really offering is the right to live anywhere in the European Union. And they say such programs can attract shady characters.\n\nBut others say that getting visas through real estate transactions involves vetting for criminal records, for instance, which is a far more restrictive process than the scrutiny faced by the million people a year who are given European Union passports through marriage or the reuniting of family.\n\n\"Anyone who is a real security threat or a major criminal would not put themselves through that scrutiny -- they have other ways to get a passport or go where they want,\" said Mr. K\u00e4lin, of Henley & Partners.\n\nThere are tax advantages in having residence rights in countries like Antigua, Cyprus and Malta, which charge little income tax on offshore assets and do not require the investor to live in the country for any significant period.\n\nMr. K\u00e4lin was a key figure in turning the trade in passports and residency visas into an industry.\n\nSt. Kitts and Nevis became the first country to introduce a formal program of selling passports in 1984, the year after it won independence from Britain.\n\nMr. K\u00e4lin approached the government with an offer to revamp the program and then negotiated a visa-free access agreement for St. Kitts with the European Union's Schengen Area, a zone comprising 26 countries without passport controls.\n\nThat kind of access was on Natalia Yavorska's mind when she and her husband bought land on the Canary Islands. She found many visa applications \"a humiliating experience where they want fingerprints and medical tests and treat you like a refugee trying to sneak over the border.\"\n\n\"A passport with visa-free access to a lot of countries is just so much better,\" she said.\n\nAfter St. Kitts, Mr. K\u00e4lin's firm went on to advise Grenada and Antigua on how to design their programs, and it is now retained by Moldova, which sells passports for \u20ac140,000 rather than requiring property investment, and Malta.\n\n\"These programs have been hugely important for those countries,\" Mr. K\u00e4lin said. \"They have transformed the economy in St. Kitts, been very significant in Antigua and Malta and have helped to dig Cyprus out of an economic crisis.\"\n\nThe minimum investment under Spain's golden visa program is \u20ac500,000, which can be made up of one or more purchases.\n\nThe Yavorski family passed that easily by spending about \u20ac1 million for land where they built a three-bedroom villa overlooking a golf course and the ocean.\n\nMaria Moreno, the head of sales at Abama Luxury Residences, a Canary Islands developer, said golden visas have become a valuable marketing tool for projects such as hers, where the Yavorskis were the first buyers.\n\n\"About 25 percent of our buyers are from outside the E.U., mainly from Russia, Ukraine, Brazil and the U.S., and four out of five apply for golden visas,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_wilson@nytimes.com", "name": "Peter Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/25/world/25real-citizenship03-inyt/25real-citizenship03-inyt-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 296128140}, {"uri": "1141254061", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "09:10:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T09:10:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/europe-was-worried-russia-would-mess-with-its-elections-now-it-has-other-fears/2019/05/20/d0c18552-77f1-11e9-a7bf-c8a43b84ee31_story.html", "title": "Europe was worried Russia would mess with its elections.

(Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images) By Michael Birnbaum Michael Birnbaum Brussels bureau chief covering Europe May 21 at 5:00 AM\n\nBRUSSELS -- Days before crucial elections for the European Parliament, politicians, security services and social media companies that were bracing for an onslaught from Russia are surprised that, so far, they seem to have avoided one.\n\nLawmakers say they haven't seen what they once feared: a flood of hacked, embarrassing documents, or Twitter accounts calling for street protests that post only during Moscow business hours.\n\nThey are cautious about saying Russian meddling has been neutralized, especially since some far-right politicians welcome Kremlin help. Just this past weekend, Austrian Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache resigned after a video filmed in 2017 showed him to be receptive to politically motivated investments from Russia.\n\nBut the anxiety has shifted somewhat inward, as many of the disinformation tactics pioneered by Russia have been domesticated, replicated on both extremes of the political debate in Europe. Meanwhile, with President Trump and his allies embracing Europe's far-right leaders, centrists here also find themselves newly worried about the potentially distorting influence of the United States.\n\n\"It's not 2016. We are not seeing the automated, networked activity with an obvious Russian fingerprint across these elections,\" said Sasha Havlicek, head of London's Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which has been tracking online disinformation. \"What we're seeing much more of is coordinated, transnational far-right information operations.\"\n\nThe European Parliament has long been a haven for odd-duck politicians outside the mainstream, since few European citizens actually understand the role of the legislature and fewer still turn out to vote. That has left an opening for people who can command a passionate minority, like Nigel Farage, the Brexit campaigner who has lost seven elections for Britain's House of Commons but has been in the European Parliament since 1999.\n\nEuroskeptic politicians did well in the last election for the European legislature in 2014. But this week they are dreaming of an epochal shift -- a wave of enough lawmakers to form a blocking minority inside the body and bring the workings of the European Union to a halt.\n\nCentrist leaders figured that Russia wanted the same thing and that the Kremlin would pull out the stops to boost its sympathizers. European leaders commissioned reports about foreign meddling, enlisted intelligence services in efforts to be vigilant, and pushed social media companies to police their platforms. But the worst fears about Kremlin involvement have not manifested, officials and analysts said.\n\n\"We are not calm about everything,\" said Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics, whose Baltic nation has a large Russian-speaking population and is on the front lines of tensions with the Kremlin. \"We are trying to monitor each and every activity that could be suspicious.\"\n\nStill, he said, \"so far, there have not been alarms about something unusual.\"\n\nHe and others cautioned that it is challenging to monitor trends in real time across 28 E.U. nations, each with their own campaigns, being conducted in 24 official languages. And they said Russia has proved adept at adapting tactics to keep a low profile. But they said that if there was a major Russian effort to swing the elections toward specific parties or candidates, it was being conducted in a different enough manner from past cycles that they hadn't yet spotted it.\n\nRussia is still working openly to promote divisive political narratives within Europe. The Sputnik news agency has offered wall-to-wall coverage of the \"yellow vest\" protests that have shaken France. The German-language homepage of RT, formerly Russia Today, recently featured a banner debunking \"myths\" that the former West Germany was superior to Communist East Germany.\n\nFrance's \"yellow vest\" protests have been a favorite subject of Russian state media. (Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters)\n\nThere has also been apparent subterfuge: The E.U.'s official disinformation-busting team last month flagged an English- and German-language news portal with Russian fingerprints, including coding that showed videos had been posted from a computer folder named \"Anastasia\" in Cyrillic script.\n\nFacebook this month said it took down 16 Russian-linked accounts, four pages and one Instagram account that were targeting users in seven E.U. countries and Ukraine. But the scale of what's been identified is nothing compared with the past -- or with what the Europeans had anticipated.\n\nJana Kobzova, an adviser to the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity, said Moscow may have calculated that these elections weren't worth the bother.\n\n\"Russia has limited resources,\" she said. \"And if they already have people like Nigel Farage being elected, they don't need to help much.\"\n\nBut analysts say Europe also may have gotten better at thwarting Russian attempts to shake up its campaigns.\n\nEuropean politicians have grown savvy about protecting their communications and are less likely to fall for phishing attempts. Facebook has promised more openness about who is paying for political advertising in European elections. Twitter is moving faster to wipe automated bot accounts from its rolls. And citizens may also be more cautious about what they see online.\n\n\"Member states are much less ignorant than in 2016, and they're aware of the need to do something,\" Kobzova said.\n\nThe collective effort on the continent stands in contrast to the United States, where the discussion about Russian interference breaks along sharp partisan lines. After Trump spoke by phone to Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin earlier this month, he tweeted that they had talked not about election meddling but about the \"Russian Hoax.\"\n\nEuropeans, meanwhile, have been unsettled by how Trump, his envoys and ultraconservative U.S. activists might influence this week's elections. The fears about the United States are not as great as about Russia. But concerns have been growing.\n\nCentrist European politicians questioned whether President Trump hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban last week to give him an election boost. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMany centrist leaders in Europe saw a clear campaign message in the timing of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's visit to Washington last week. Trump said that Orban -- who has been hit with official E.U. proceedings for rule-of-law violations -- \"has done a tremendous job in so many different ways. Highly respected. Respected all over Europe. Probably, like me, a little bit controversial, but that's okay.\"\n\nAt the same time, some of Trump's envoys to Europe have been more overtly partisan than ambassadors from previous administrations. The U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, has slammed German leaders for their stance on migration, threatened them about a planned natural gas pipeline to Russia and praised German Chancellor Angela Merkel's rivals.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell has rattled his hosts by wading into the country's politics. (Hayoung Jeon/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nEuropean politicians have also been alarmed by money pouring in from ultraconservative U.S. social activists, who have paid for lobbying and activism on issues such as migration and same-sex marriage. An OpenDemocracy analysis of U.S. tax filings found that at least $50 million had flowed into Europe in the past decade -- a drop in the bucket by U.S. standards, but a significant cash flow in the lower-budget world of European politics.\n\nThat report prompted 38 European lawmakers to demand an E.U. investigation of money flows from the United States, looking at \"the threat posed by Christian fundamentalists\" and other \"nefarious outside influences.\"\n\nOne American influence who has been more marginal than anticipated is Stephen K. Bannon, Trump's onetime strategist, who made much ado about organizing Europe's far-right ahead of these elections.\n\nBannon has appeared alongside Italy's Matteo Salvini and France's Marine Le Pen. But his pre-election effort to supply sympathetic candidates with polling data and campaign advice was thwarted by campaign finance laws and a lack of interest from far-right leaders. Bannon now says he will try to build coalitions among the far-right politicians once they have stormed the Parliament.\n\nStephen K. Bannon has not gotten far with his effort to organize far-right European parties. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nFar-right parties in Europe haven't needed Bannon, or Russia, in part because some of their domestic supporters have mimicked Russia's strategy of promoting disinformation and amplifying it with automated accounts.\n\nAhead of Spanish national elections last month, Facebook took down three networks that appeared to be spreading disinformation automatically. Avaaz, the activist group that flagged the content, estimated that the networks had almost 1.7\u2009million followers. The pages shared doctored pictures of a left-wing leader giving a Nazi salute, made-up data about North African men being disproportionately responsible for rape cases in Spain and an inaccurate news item about \"Catalan separatists\" closing down children's cancer clinics in favor of Catalan embassies.\n\nSeparately, analysts have questioned whether automation may be playing a role in online support for the far-right Alternative for Germany party. In a sample of German online political content examined by research firm Alto Data Analytics, less than 1\u2009percent of the users generated 10\u2009percent of the posts, most of them in favor of Alternative for Germany. They acknowledge the difficulty of separating some automated activity from real users who are extremely enthusiastic.\n\n\"It is hard to tell, but I wouldn't want to underestimate European populistic right-wing communications strategies,\" said Judith Sargentini, a Dutch Green Left party member of the European Parliament and a foe of the far-right. \"If we were to start blaming this on Russia or the U.S., we would let all these people in Europe that are sending out these racist, bigoted messages be less responsible for their own acts.\"\n\nQuentin Ari\u00e8s contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nEurope's far-right says it is united.

Nationalists have gained ground across Europe, and as they head into the elections with a newly united front, the vote is being seen as the latest test of their influence. Polls suggest that populist parties could be positioned to make big gains.\n\nHere's a guide to the European Parliament elections, a notoriously confusing system made even more so by changing dynamics within the bloc.\n\nHow does the European Parliament work?\n\nVoters will elect the 751 members of the European Parliament to five-year terms, with the number of seats for each nation determined primarily by its population.\n\nEach country uses a slightly different process, with the uniting requirement that the number of seats won by political parties be roughly proportional to their share of the vote. Member nations must hold their elections no earlier than Thursday and no later than Sunday.\n\nThe system is relatively new -- the first elections were held just 40 years ago -- and it is still evolving.\n\nOnce elected, nearly all lawmakers organize into Pan-European groups -- there are currently eight -- along broad ideological lines. The most powerful group has long been the center-right European People's Party, a coalition that includes Germany's governing Christian Democrats and the Republicans, the leading opposition party in France.\n\nThe European Parliament approves or rejects legislation, establishes budgets and supervises a variety of institutions within the bloc. It also plays a crucial role in selecting the president of the European Commission; the current president, Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, whose term ends later this year, has said he will not be a candidate.\n\nBut the Parliament shares decision-making power with several other bodies, including the European Commission, whose members are appointed by national governments, and the European Council, representing governments of member states.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this makes for decision-making that is complicated at best, and made more so by being seen through different regional or ideological lenses.\n\n\"There is no single understanding of how the E.U. works,\" said Katjana Gattermann, an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam who studies perceptions of the European Union. \"In the 28 countries, politics are always interpreted a bit differently.\"\n\nHow is rising nationalism affecting the elections?\n\nWhile pro-Europe parties have long dominated the Parliament, a nationalist and populist movement gaining ground across the Continent has begun to make its mark on the European Union.\n\nMatteo Salvini, the powerful leader of the anti-immigrant League party in Italy, announced last month the formation of a new European alliance of populist and far-right parties, providing a formidable threat to the establishment.\n\nNationalist parties, which at first glance seem incompatible with a transnational body, hope to change the European Union from within, said Daphne Halikiopoulou, an associate professor at the University of Reading in Britain and an expert on nationalism.\n\nMr. Salvini, who serves as Italy's deputy prime minister and interior minister, and his allies advocate stronger borders, greater national autonomy and a weaker European Union. The governing parties in Poland and Hungary, though not part of his alliance, have similar views.\n\nDr. Halikiopoulou said these groups have widened their appeal because their style of nationalism focuses on an \"outsider\" defined in ideological terms.\n\n\"This makes them much more attractive to a broad range of social groups, giving them more political appeal,\" she said. \"These parties get support now from a broader range of voters. It's not just the white angry men of the past.\"\n\nGaining power at the European level can help these parties bolster their status at home, Dr. Halikiopoulou said. But their nationalist ideals could leave them unable to form a functioning group within the European Parliament, a necessary step for decision-making power.\n\n\"It might in the end be their Achilles heel,\" she said, \"because it prevents them, by definition, from forging successful alliances at the E.U. level.\"\n\nHow does Brexit factor in?\n\nBritain was scheduled to leave the European Union on March 29, so it did not plan on taking part in this election. But the government's failure to agree on a withdrawal deal forced it to postpone the departure -- requiring participation in the vote.\n\nOn Thursday, British voters will have the bizarre experience of electing 73 representatives to an institution that their nation is seeking to divorce.\n\nIn local elections this month, voters severely punished the governing Conservative Party for the Brexit gridlock, and they are expected to do it again in the European Parliament contests. Public opinion polls show the Conservatives in fourth place.\n\nThe biggest beneficiary is expected to be the new Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage, the divisive politician who became one of the loudest voices for the nation's withdrawal. It could win more than 30 percent of the vote, according to recent polls.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party is suffering, too, being punished by many supporters for its failure to fight to remain in the bloc. Firmly pro-Europe parties like the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the newly formed group Change UK are expected to make gains on Thursday.\n\nOnce Britain leaves the European Union, its representatives will vacate the European Parliament; 27 seats will be redistributed to the remaining member nations, with the other 46 seats being retired.\n\nAcross Europe, surveys show that support for the European Union is higher than ever, and parties that once toyed publicly with following Britain's lead rarely raise the notion of leaving the bloc.\n\n\"The idea of belonging to the E.U. is at its highest support at the moment, and at the same time you see these rising nationalists,\" Dr. Halikiopoulou said. \"But Brexit has been a deterrent and has shown other countries that the implementation is simply not worth it.\"\n\nWhy is voter turnout typically so low?\n\nVoter turnout has steadily declined since the first election in 1979, which saw 62 percent of eligible citizens take part. In 2014, 42.6 percent cast ballots, far below the average turnout for national elections across Europe.\n\nThis is due, in part, to European elections being widely viewed by voters -- and even by the politicians taking part -- as less important than national elections.\n\n\"From a European perspective, it's mainly the domestic policies that are seen as mattering,\" said Dr. Gattermann, who studies perceptions of the European Union. A lack of understanding about the institution also dampens turnout, she said, even though many policy decisions made at the European Parliament directly affect local policies.\n\nThis mentality also helps explain why smaller parties -- including some of the rising nationalist groups -- can gain ground at the European level while struggling to do so at home. Many citizens also use the European Parliament vote as a protest, believing that the stakes are lower.\n\n\"Its also a place for smaller and newer parties, or single-issue parties, to test out the waters in an election,\" Dr. Gattermann said.\n\nMatteo Salvini Announces New European Alliance of Far-Right PopulistsApril 8, 2019European Elections Will Gauge the Power of PopulismMay 19, 2019Nigel Farage, Brexit's Loudest Voice, Seizes Comeback ChanceMay 14, 2019", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "megan_specia@nytimes.com", "name": "Megan Specia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/20/world/xxeu-explainer1/merlin_153176205_2c568c53-06d8-41b7-bde2-36112db3170a-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4797814", "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 296122620}, {"uri": "1140934266", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-20", "time": "23:08:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-20T23:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5098039507865906, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/opinion/australia-election-climate-change.html", "title": "Opinion | An Electoral Brush Fire in Australia", "body": "It was another election that couldn't be lost until it was. Rived by years of infighting, Australia's conservative governing coalition was trailing in the polls. The opposition Labor Party's polls showed it all but certain of ousting Prime Minister Scott Morrison, and its action platform on climate change seemed bound to resonate in a country devastated by drought, heat waves, brush fires and the loss of its magnificent Great Barrier Reef to warming seas.\n\nOn Saturday, in another surprise of the sort that had stunned Americans and Britons, Australian voters handed Mr. Morrison what he called a \"miracle\" victory. His conservative Liberal-National coalition, sharply opposed to cutting down on carbon emissions and coal, is expected to take 77 seats, one more than enough for a majority.\n\nIn hindsight, there are many reasons Mr. Morrison defied predictions. One was his success in projecting himself as the average Joe, a rugby-loving, beer-drinking evangelical Christian in a baseball cap who peppered his speeches with folksy Australianisms and slogans like \"a fair go for those who have a go.\" Urban Australians rolled their eyes, but polls show that whatever they thought of his party, the larger pool of those Mr. Morrison called the \"quiet Australians\" -- a category similar to those who voted for Brexit or President Trump -- consistently favored him over the Labor Party's Bill Shorten.\n\nThe troubling message was that even on an island-continent where the ravages of climate change are there for all to see, especially after the hottest summer on record, invocations of economic stability, secure jobs, cuts to immigration and conservative family values trump the unknowns and costs of dealing with climate change.\n\nThe surprise result also appeared to reflect a recent tendency of pollsters to underestimate the strength of conservative candidates and causes. Benjamin Netanyahu's victory in Israel in 2015, and Britain's Brexit vote and Mr. Trump's election, both in 2016, confounded pollsters' and pundits' predictions and have caused considerable analysis and soul-searching in the world of survey research.\n\nThere are many possible explanations for these polling misses, from voters' lying to survey-takers or avoiding pollsters altogether, to faulty turnout models, to a tendency by polling companies to reinforce one another's findings, a phenomenon called \"herding.\" The industry is hard at work trying to correct these problems, and the generally accurate polling in the United States' 2018 congressional election was a good sign.\n\nLike other victorious conservative populists, including in the United States, Mr. Morrison had the advantage of an easier message: change is risky and expensive; leftist plans to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases will wreck the economy, which has grown without interruption for 28 years. In the final debate between the candidates, each was told to ask the other two questions. Mr. Shorten used both of his to promote Labor policies, which included tackling climate change and wide-ranging reforms; Mr. Morrison used his to attack Labor policies.\n\nThe conservative coalition made the cost of addressing climate change the dominant issue. One economic model cited by Labor estimated that the 45 percent reduction in carbon emissions would cost the economy 167,000 jobs and 264 billion Australian dollars ($181 billion). Mr. Morrison used the study to claim Australia could not afford its current programs to reduce emissions and invest in clean energy.\n\nIt is certainly discouraging that so many voters in a democratic society could choose to shut their eyes to the obvious and immediate danger of climate change. The election gave added evidence that climate wars have become an adjunct of the politics of grievance that have brought populists to power in America, Europe and elsewhere, and have rent electorates into bitterly opposed camps of urban and provincial, young and old, activist and cautious.\n\nBut Mr. Morrison's victory does not necessarily mean he will do nothing about greenhouse gases. The pressure to take action is certain to grow, especially from the young, who demonstrate a strong concern for the climate, and several candidates who pushed a climate-change agenda did win. (Alas, the government is likely to support a hugely contentious coal mine proposed in the northeastern state of Queensland, which would be among the world's largest if approved, but Labor gave mixed signals on what it would have done.)\n\nWhat the Australian election outcome revealed was the urgent need to broaden the message for reducing carbon emissions, and to separate it from the divisive culture wars afflicting Western democracies.\n\nMr. Morrison confounded the pundits with his victory. He could now confound them even more by showing that he is ready to lead Australia, a country where the ravages of man-made climate change are most evident, in fighting back. As the first director of Tourism Australia, Mr. Morrison approved the cheeky \"So where the bloody hell are you?\" advertising campaign.

It's Cautious.", "body": "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Ahead of Australia's general election on Saturday, one party had campaigned on the idea that politics and the economy were rigged in favor of the elites. It attacked its opponent relentlessly for siding with the \"top end of town.\" It insisted that things needed to be shaken up to stop serving multinational corporations and vested interests. That party lost.\n\nThe results were surprising. The center-right coalition, led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, remained in power against the opposition Labor party, which had led in every poll for years. But aside from being an upset, the election here shared little in common with Donald Trump's 2016 victory, the Brexit referendum or other populist insurgencies around the world.\n\nThis was a campaign in which the politics of race, xenophobia and immigration played almost no part. (That's probably because of the atmosphere after terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March.) There was nothing in Mr. Morrison's election pitch, perhaps other than continued support for coal mining, that seemed particularly aimed at rousing right-wing voters. Even on climate change, a major election issue on which there was some distance between the parties, Mr. Morrison argued his party was acting sufficiently -- not dismissing it as some elite conspiracy. No, the lesson from Australia's election isn't that this country is right-wing but that it's conservative -- as in cautious.\n\nYou could, if you were being unkind, call Labor's platform populist. And in fairness, the moment seemed right for its agenda: A royal commission into Australia's banks recently revealed all manner of unethical practices and underwrote a public sense of disgust at corporate lawlessness. Stagnating wages following the decline of a mining boom have meant that many Australians are facing financial stress. House prices in the biggest cities have galloped wildly out of reach of many would-be first-time buyers.\n\nTo address these very real economic concerns, Labor put forward serious, bold policies on complex issues that it argued overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy, in particular tax breaks on investment properties and retirees' stock market dividends. It was probably the most ambitious set of reforms any party has taken to an election in a generation.\n\nThe coalition contrived to run without a significant policy agenda beyond offering tax cuts. Overwhelmingly, its campaign was a negative one, attacking Labor's platform as reckless and anti-aspirational. But this wasn't a populist message, either. In fact it's a message of contentedness and caution. Its fundamental assumption is that broadly speaking, the system works fine: Trickle-down economics brings prosperity, and to the extent things could be better, such as wages, the answer is patience and more of the same. Labor couldn't be trusted precisely because it wanted to shake things up.\n\nThat this argument delivered the coalition a stunning victory in what appeared to be an unwinnable election does not represent some new Australian political logic. Rather, it follows a well-established tradition and conventional wisdom: The Australian electorate is averse to big change.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the last time an opposition attempted a policy platform this bold was in 1993 and the result was the same, only with the parties reversed. At that time, Labor was in government, and the coalition managed to lose what is frequently described as \"the unlosable election.\" It is also no coincidence that Labor, which is Australia's party of reform, has been in power for only 29 of Australia's 74 postwar years. It also tends to come to power when a moment of crisis is brewing: world wars, the Great Depression, the global financial crisis.\n\nIn ordinary times, Australia votes for mild, slow change. Usually that gives power to the coalition, but even the coalition tests Australia's conservative temperament at its peril. The last time it lost power was in 2007 when it undertook sweeping labor reforms, which amounted to a significant attack on workers' rights and tilted the power balance hugely in favor of employers. Labor's problem this time proved to be that it tried too many big ideas at once.\n\nThus did Labor lose significantly in outer suburbs, including among several lower-income electorates. Perhaps the most underappreciated predictor here seems to be debt: Those seats that are experiencing heavy mortgage stress almost entirely swung sharply against Labor. That suggests that even though those voters might be financially stretched, they were spooked by Labor's proposed changes to tax policy, which were subject to a scare campaign warning that they would cause house prices to collapse.\n\nPerhaps that might have been countered had Labor run a better, more focused campaign. That post-mortem is now underway. Even so, the fact that Labor's narrative of \"fairness\" failed before the coalition's story of \"aspiration\" suggests Australia has not called time on neoliberalism in the way that voters elsewhere seem ready to. Certainly there is disillusionment, evidenced by a record vote for minor parties and independents. But ultimately, 27 years of economic growth and only six years of wage stagnation (rather than the decades of it in the United States) mean that while skepticism of the corporate world and trepidation about the economy exists, Australia isn't prepared to experiment with its economic formula just yet. Australians may not be entirely happy with the status quo, but they are clearly still prepared to vote for it.\n\nWaleed Aly, a contributing opinion writer, is a columnist, a broadcaster and a politics lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

British political discourse resembles, at times, a national dream journal. People use their public platforms to suggest futures beyond the political impasse that are -- politically, legally, sometimes even physically -- unattainable, and yet like all fantasy, reveal much about what they really desire.\n\nThe Leavers' backward-facing dreams of imperial renewal are one example. Remainers' legal and procedural challenges to Brexit (and perhaps the very idea the whole thing could be bottled by a second referendum) count as well. But the latest fantasy, emerging in the press and on social media as the politics around Brexit remain as deadlocked as ever and Prime Minister Theresa May founders before a Parliament that will neither pass her deal nor remove her from power, is to call for a competent foreign leader to take over the country. Less \"take back control\" and more \"why can't someone else do it.\"\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand is a popular candidate for the job. \"If the United Kingdom had been led by Ardern we might still have had Brexit, but we would not have ended up with this national humiliation, a divided society and an imperiled economy,\" Tony Blair's former chief of staff wrote in The Guardian in March. This was echoed by a columnist in The Mirror: \"If only Theresa were more like Jacinda maybe we wouldn't be in this mess,\" before declaring, \"If only we could get her.\" Even a columnist in the Scottish Sun, a conservative paper, asked: \"Can we adopt her? Please? Can we have her as Prime Minister, this living, smiling antidote to our own drippy, croaky, indecisive, soulless Theresa?\"\n\nThe desire spills out on social media, too. I hesitate to recommend Twitter as useful for any sort of public sentiment analysis, but right now there are people -- real people with children, best-selling books and magazine columns -- imploring not just Ms. Ardern, or the similarly affable prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, but Donald Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland and current president of the European Commission, to take over Britain.\n\nThe exact method of this potential coup is never discussed, because, of course, the people calling for it don't actually mean it. But they do mean something. This particular fantasy -- a familiar foreign leader in competent managerial mode saving the country -- is something entirely new, and not specific to Brexit. In the immediate aftermath of President Trump's election, I lost count of the number of Americans who, upon learning I was Canadian, would wait a single, sad beat, before asking if they could borrow Mr. Trudeau. The American news media was particularly committed to this dream: recall the cover of Rolling Stone magazine in July 2017 asking \"Why can't he be our president?\"\n\nBrexit and Trump are often said to be signs that politics is broken; they signal deep, unseen faults preceding them, which have only fractured further since. This suggests a breakdown not just of specific administrations in the short term, but a large-scale loss of faith in entire national systems of politics. The real heart of the competent-outsider fantasy is that politics is still O.K. somewhere else, that there is a place it hasn't become splintered, tribal and seemingly beyond control.\n\nBut these leaders don't actually offer solutions to problems like Brexit or Mr. Trump's election. How could they? Neither New Zealand nor Canada has faced these kinds of challenges. Nor does their appeal lie in their fresh-faced, telegenic youth. The fantasy here is about something else, not a path forward out of political crisis, but a return to an idealized past of consensus. Mr. Trudeau and Ms. Ardern are attractive because they still practice a brand of genial, inclusive liberalism, the so-called \"third way\" that ruled Western democratic politics for the better part of the past 25 years, and in doing so, they nod to the familiarity and safety of our own political past.\n\nSo when we laud them, we acclaim the very intangible qualities that seem to have vanished from our own politics and politicians: optimism, openness, pragmatism, a sense of general ease in the world. These objects of fantasy seem as if they were dreamed up by the great theorist of 1990s third way politics, Anthony Giddens. Their immediate antecedents are Mr. Blair and Bill Clinton, politicians who first realized the value of speaking in moral imperatives while presenting the rational cool of a business executive.\n\nIn those years, politicians appeared to have transcended ideology and the need to mediate conflict, and focused instead on delivering incremental gains in prosperity and social justice. They became less like leaders and more like pragmatic managers. \"What matters is what works,\" Mr. Blair frequently claimed.\n\nAcross the Western world, governments became more similar and more stable than at perhaps any other point in our history. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Blair brought in like-minded leaders to promote what Sidney Blumenthal, a confident of Mr. Clinton, called \"an international Third Way.\" Al From, an adviser to the Democratic Party, wrote in 1997 that the third way was \"the worldwide brand name for progressive politics for the Information Age,\" evoking the binding, world-shrinking pulse of the early public internet.\n\nAnd so, like the transnational business class they drew their vocabulary and values from, politicians came to appear strangely interchangeable. When George W. Bush was elected in the United States -- an anomaly, it seemed at the time -- Mr. Blair was jokingly called \"the Prime Minister of the United States,\" and American liberals like the writer Paul Berman lauded him as \"the leader of the free world.\" Mr. Blair, in absentia, was the carrier of this new, irresistible internationalism.\n\nMs. Ardern and Mr. Trudeau fit within that lineage. Ms. Ardern worked as a policy adviser to Mr. Blair and heads a New Zealand Labour Party that is politically similar to its British counterpart in the Blair era. In 2016, Mr. Blair himself singled out Mr. Trudeau as one of a handful of leaders to \"renew the Third Way.\"\n\nBut in the countries where it began, the United States and Britain, this kind of politics is in decline with the electorate. The problems were clear from the beginning: \"They imply that we now live in a society which is no longer structured by social division,\" the political theorist Chantal Mouffe wrote in 1998. And sure enough, politicians promised it was possible to surf the waves of globalization at the exact moment when all the middle and lower classes could do was tread water, and parties of the right formed or reconstituted around cultural fault lines.\n\nRelatedOpinion | Sushil AaronWhy Jacinda Ardern MattersMarch 19, 2019\n\nThese are the divisions that shape our politics now. And there is no substantive reason to think that leaders elsewhere would be better suited to deal with them than the ones we currently have. After all, they come from the same stock. Changing government, Mr. Blair said in 1999, \"is like sweeping away the entire management of a company\" -- but there are few people today who believe that management is what we truly need, and fewer still think that switching out the chief executive for a smarter, better looking one counts as change. The notion rings obviously hollow now, but the main proponents of these fantasies spent most of their lives in a world where it seemed self-evident.\n\nThe great irony is that the political shift that happened in the 1990s was fundamentally opposed to nostalgia. Mr. Giddens wrote at the time of a \"post-traditional society\" and a new politics that freed market economics from sentimental conservative dreams of traditional family and religion, and social justice from romantic leftist notions of solidarity and revolutionary change. Like all things claiming to represent the future in their time, it now evokes nostalgia itself.\n\nStephen Buranyi (@stephenburanyi) is a writer based in London.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

(Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post) By Andrew L. Yarrow May 20 at 7:00 AM\n\nOne evening in late March, about 20 activists gathered at a cafe in Dupont Circle to discuss their campaign strategy for an upcoming election, in which thousands of Washington-area residents are eligible to cast ballots. How can we best get out the vote? What happens if a new party enters the race? How do we counter the far right?\n\nIt was shaping up to be one of the more important elections of recent years. What election might that be, you ask? Not the one that will decide who controls the Virginia legislature. That's in November. And despite the growing horde of presidential candidates, the Iowa caucuses are not until February. No, the people gathered at the cafe weren't Bernie Bros and they weren't wearing MAGA hats. The voters they were seeking to influence weren't even American, but French.\n\nEver since a 2008 reform came into effect, French expats have had an intriguing political relationship to their home country. In elections for the French National Assembly, overseas citizens now vote for candidates to represent them where they live. French residents of the United States and Canada, for instance, have a representative in the 577-member assembly -- as do French voters in 10 other overseas constituencies.\n\nThe day of the meeting in Dupont Circle, a different type of campaign was on the agenda: the election for the European Parliament, set for May 26. French expats do not have specific representatives in the European Parliament; like all French voters, they cast ballots for a party's list, with seats allotted based on how many overall votes the party wins. Still, France's system of representation in the National Assembly gives expats a more relevant stake in their country's politics -- and arguably shapes their involvement in all elections.\n\nEveryone in attendance at the meeting was a partisan of La R\u00e9publique En Marche (LREM), France's governing party. They sat around a long oval table filled with croissants, cafe au lait and policy documents. There were college students and economists, policy wonks and retirees, some wearing jeans or spring dresses, others still spiffy in their work clothes. They spoke in French about politics and strategy, occasionally lapsing into English.\n\nB\u00e9atrice Leydier, a young employee of an international-development NGO, urged the committee to do outreach with families whose children go or went to Rochambeau, the French international school in Bethesda, Md. Laughing, she recalled leafleting before the 2017 presidential and parliamentary elections outside a local French bakery on weekends, where she had gone in hopes of finding French people.\n\nThis year's European elections are important for many reasons, some of the LREM supporters told me. In the wake of Brexit and often virulent anti-European Union sentiment across the continent, the key issue, at least symbolically, is the survival of the 28-nation union. \"Many far-right nationalist parties in Europe tap into long-standing fears about globalization and a dilution of national identity, and are hostile to immigration, Islam and the E.U. itself,\" said Kaltoum Maroufi-Colle, an art teacher at Montgomery College.\n\n\"We want to improve the E.U., but the nationalists have no vision for Europe and don't believe in the E.U.,\" Guillaume Deybach, the chief executive of a local insurance company, said as he sipped a glass of red wine.\n\n\"We're in a bubble here,\" cautioned Jeremy Lagelee, a young lawyer who recently moved back to Paris. \"President Macron is very popular here.\" Lagelee recalled finding almost no supporters of the far-right and far-left candidates when he campaigned for LREM in Washington in 2017.\n\nIndeed. Although Emmanuel Macron has been beset with \"yellow vest\" protesters in recent months, he was a big favorite of the 160,000 French nationals in America, and in Washington especially. He won more than 92 percent of the D.C.-area vote in the second, decisive round of the 2017 election, when his opponent was Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front. By contrast, in France, Macron won 66.1 percent.\n\nAlexandre Kleitman, who co-directs LREM's Washington \"committee\" with Leydier, said they would try to reach the more than 15,000 French voters in the D.C. region mostly through social media and existing networks. (The party has 17 committees working for it in the United States. Other French political parties also have committees, although they are fewer and far less active.) But turning out the vote for European Parliament seats can be tough because that election draws less attention than French parliamentary ones. In 2014, during the last campaign for the European Parliament -- where France currently has 74 of 751 seats -- turnout among French voters in the United States was only about 10 percent. Compare that to the 2017 presidential election, when voter turnout among U.S.-based French nationals was 44 percent, according to France-Am\u00e9rique, a magazine published by the French Embassy.\n\nLaurence Sage, a retired World Bank employee living near Friendship Heights, likes France's post-2008 practice of electing overseas representatives to the National Assembly. \"We need a representative who is conscious of matters that concern those of us with a foot in both continents,\" Sage explained. Nabil Bessaha, a 45-year-old in North Bethesda who has spent most of his working life in D.C., added, \"We want to make sure that France doesn't treat us like second-class citizens.\"\n\n\"French living abroad have different issues from those living in France,\" Roland Lescure, the representative for the United States and Canada in the French National Assembly, told me from Paris. \"They're concerned about things like what benefits can they qualify for, funding for overseas French schools, and moving in and out of the country.\"\n\nLescure, 52, was just another French expat when he was elected in 2017. He now represents one of the world's geographically largest political constituencies, stretching from Puerto Rico to Yukon. A financier in Montreal whose parents had been Communists, he had never been a politician, but like many LREM candidates, he was seduced by Macron's potential to alter the French political landscape. \"French politics needed a change,\" he said. \"The usual suspects had been around too long, and many of us wanted to break the old left-right divide.\"\n\nLescure not only represents his U.S. and Canadian constituents but also chairs a parliamentary economic-affairs committee, focusing on making France more competitive and business-friendly. \"It's a pretty fast pace,\" he said of his job. \"I make about 15 trips a year\" to Washington and elsewhere in North America.\n\nBack in Dupont Circle, Deybach slyly reflected on the benefits of being a Frenchman voting in Washington. Because overseas French are exempt from most French taxes if they spend more than six months of the year outside of France, he said: \"Unlike D.C. residents, who have taxation without representation, we have representation without taxation.\"\n\nAndrew L.

Pelosi's slow burn approach to the biggest issue of her speakership has so far kept her caucus united, but the question is how long that can last.\n\nReset, please: Despite the allure of initiating impeachment proceedings in some Democratic circles, Pelosi still favors an agenda laser-focused on health care, raising wages, and anti-corruption efforts, which she believes voters want headed into the 2020 elections.\n\nThe email tracks with a meeting my colleagues Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis reported on: In a closed-door House Democratic session last Wednesday, Pelsoi told Democrats to \"stick to their policy agenda ahead of the 2020 election rather than initiate impeachment proceedings.

While Pelosi has successfully reined in public disagreement over her strategy, the push and pull of initiating impeachment proceedings is increasingly playing out in public.\n\nOne of Pelosi's chief lieutenants, House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), admitted on the Sunday shows that Trump may be backing the party into a corner.\n\nICMYI: While Trump is seeking to block Deutsche Bank from complying with congressional subpoenas from the House Intelligence and Financial Services committees seeking Trump's personal and business financial records, the New York Times's David Enrich revealed that \"Anti-money laundering specialists at Deutsche Bank recommended in 2016 and 2017 that multiple transactions involving legal entities controlled by Donald J.

But this time is different, coming after five years of crises have swept the continent and during a moment where European identity is as much a domestic issue as it is an international one.\n\nBrexit: Britain was never supposed to participate in these elections. But Prime Minister Theresa May's failure to get her withdrawal plan passed at home has now almost guaranteed the country might be sending members to the same body it voted to leave. If that's not weird enough, the new European Parliament won't be seated until November, meaning that Britain's Members of European Parliament (MEP) may never be seated or serve extremely short terms.\n\nNationalism: The post-Brexit fear was that the E.U. would see a rush to the exits by other nations. Instead, even nationalist parties that despise Brussels have found that its unwise to mount leave campaigns. Figures like Italy's Matteo Salvini and France's Marine Le Pen are instead looking to change the system from the inside.\n\nKey: The elections could determine the fate of several leaders of America's chief allies such as France and Germany.

(Fabian Bimmer/Reuters) By Griff Witte and Griff Witte Europe-focused correspondent with extensive experience in the Middle East and South Asia Luisa Beck Luisa Beck Reporter covering Europe from The Washington Post's Berlin bureau May 19 at 6:00 AM\n\nBREMEN, Germany -- If there was ever a safe haven for Europe's center-left, it was the brawny industrial hub of Bremen.\n\nThick with workers at the region's bountiful factories and pulsating harbor, the city-state voted for the Social Democrats -- Germany's oldest party, famed for its Nazi-era resistance -- for more than 70 years. But perhaps not this one.\n\nIn elections May 26, the party that effortlessly dominated is in danger of losing its grip. It's a once-unthinkable indignity that reflects a broader identity crisis for parties across the West -- including America's Democrats -- that present themselves as champions of workers, unions and social democracy, but have seen support wither in their former heartlands.\n\nFor Germany's Social Democrats, the outlook is especially dire.\n\n\"What we're witnessing is a really big moment,\" said Andreas Klee, director of the politics program at Bremen University. \"It's the burial of a party.\"\n\nThe party itself is not ready to declare its demise. Even as the Social Democrats careen toward a new nadir -- with dismal results expected not only in Bremen but across the country in European parliamentary elections -- party leaders and activists are plotting a revival.\n\nAnd as with Democrats in the United States -- as well as like-minded parties across Europe -- much of the momentum is coming from the left.\n\nJust as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has ignited passions among liberal American voters, the leader of the Social Democrats' youth wing, the Adidas-wearing Kevin K\u00fchnert, is leading an insurgency within his party aimed at a bolder, more radical course.\n\nHe vigorously defends socialism, and recently dominated German political conversations for days with his suggestion that automaker BMW be collectivized. \"Without collectivization,\" he told the German newspaper Die Zeit, \"overcoming capitalism is inconceivable.\"\n\nKevin K\u00fchnert, head of the youth wing of the German Social Democrats (SPD), visits a Berlin apartment building where residents are concerned about affordable housing. (Carsten Koall/Getty Images)\n\nThe comments provoked a furor -- including stinging condemnations, many from within the Social Democrats' own ranks -- but also emboldened supporters who feel the party's coziness with the ruling conservatives has led it to an electoral dead end.\n\nEven without going as far as K\u00fchnert would like, leaders of the Social Democrats (SPD) have signaled they are prepared to turn left. The party recently disavowed welfare cuts implemented during the SPD's last run atop the federal government, an era when the party saw capturing the center as the surest path to power.\n\nMeanwhile, some SPD leaders are mulling whether to break off their long-running role as junior partner in a coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union. That decision would probably come with the choice to draw a more vivid distinction between Germany's two traditionally dominant parties.\n\nThe left has been invigorated elsewhere in Europe as the center-left declines. In Greece, a radical leftist party won two elections and has driven the old center-left party to the brink of extinction. In Britain, the Labour Party is led by Jeremy Corbyn, a figure once relegated to the far-left fringe. And in Spanish elections last month, the center-left Socialists came out on top with an unapologetic defense of progressive policies, including a 22-percent minimum wage hike.\n\n\"Among social democrats across Europe right now, it's mainstream to look left,\" said Joachim Schuster, a member of the European Parliament and longtime Bremen politician. \"We've had years of cooperation with the conservatives, and most of us are not too happy about it. We need to establish our differences.\"\n\nThe overall picture for both the center-left and center-right in Europe is one of decline. In this month's elections for the European Parliament, both factions are on pace for big losses, with each camp likely to shed about 20 percent of its seats as the continent's politics continue to fragment.\n\nBut the struggles of social democratic parties have been more existential. The situation in Bremen shows why.\n\nBritain's opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn attends the launch of his party's European election campaign in Chatham, England, on May 9. (Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nFor decades, elections here were a foregone conclusion, with powerful unions helping to ensure their members made their way from the factory floor to the voting booth to cast ballots for the SPD. But the workers of old are gone -- and so are the party's voters.\n\n\"Twenty years ago, you took a tour of the Airbus factory here and you saw people with tools actually making the planes. Now you walk in and it looks like a dentist's office. People are working on laptops. It's very sterile,\" said Klee, the politics professor. \"The core problem with the SPD is they don't have a voter base anymore.\"\n\nThat reality has brought the party to the brink of an astonishing result: In state elections here May 26, which coincide with the European vote, polls show the SPD may lose to the CDU for the first time in Germany's post-World War II history.\n\nDefeat could have national implications, making it more likely that the SPD would pull out of the coalition with Merkel's party and force new federal elections.\n\nAlthough that is considered unlikely until the end of the year, it's the outcome that K\u00fchnert and his allies are pushing for -- a necessary prerequisite, he argues, for the party's revival after years in which it has governed with Merkel while sinking in the polls.\n\n\"We were always against the grand coalition with the conservatives,\" said Sebastian Schmugler, who leads the SPD's youth wing in Bremen. \"Now we can say, 'We told you so.'\u2009\"\n\nSchmugler, a 24-year-old law student, said the party needs to compromise less and fight for its ideals more or it risks trending toward irrelevance.\n\n\"The young generation can't understand it. We have our positions, but then we make a deal and we lose too much,\" he said. \"So we're just going down, down, down.\"\n\nBut ditching the coalition might not be enough to reverse the party's fortunes.\n\nThe depth of the problem was on display at a recent debate at a Bremen vocational school. At one time, the SPD would have been the clear crowd favorite. But this time, the room appeared divided among a number of mainstream parties.\n\nKevin K\u00fchnert, speaking in Wittenberg, Germany, says his party should abandon its centrist partnership and move left. (Jens Schlueter/Getty Images)\n\nAnd the questions from the students -- hundreds of whom listened intently for 90 minutes as the candidates spelled out positions -- were hardly in the SPD's wheelhouse. None focused on wages, pensions or social welfare. Instead, the students asked about artificial intelligence, immigration and, most of all, climate change.\n\nEspecially on the latter two issues, the SPD has struggled to form clear positions as it has sought to balance competing interests among supporters whose positions don't fit neatly with any ideology. Other parties have not had the same problem -- and have benefited as the SPD has bled.\n\n\"We have leaks in both directions,\" said Bj\u00f6rn Tsch\u00f6pe, leader of the SPD in the state parliament. \"To the Greens because of climate change and on identity issues to the far right.\"\n\nTsch\u00f6pe, a gray-haired party veteran, cautioned that any lurch to the left will come with costs. And he asserted that K\u00fchnert, while asking the right questions, is \"wrong\" to think that collectivization of private companies is the answer.\n\nThe party's rebuilding, he acknowledged, would need to be a long-term process, with even strongholds like Bremen potentially lost along the way.\n\n\"If you govern a place for over 70 years, you are responsible for its good points and its bad,\" he said. \"You can't blame anyone else.\"\n\nRead more\n\nIn what may be Britain's last European election, Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party is expected to dominate\n\nItaly's Salvini leads Europe's ethnonationalist surge\n\nMacron wants to revive Europe, but European elections could kill his plans.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/w4VazJO7wRebWmmQHNmb1KS22XI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KFN4GCTXJMI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4791515", "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 295957440}, {"uri": "1139680237", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2019-05-19", "time": "07:56:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-19T07:56:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/frances-macron-forced-to-curb-his-ambitions-for-europe/2019/05/19/af8676cc-7a08-11e9-a7bf-c8a43b84ee31_story.html", "title": "France's Macron forced to curb his ambitions for Europe", "body": "By Sylvie Corbet and Angela Charlton\u2009|\u2009AP May 19 at 3:41 AM\n\nPARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron sees himself as Europe's savior and next week's European Parliament elections as a make-or-break moment for the beleaguered European Union.\n\nBut Macron is no longer the fresh-faced force who marched into a surprising presidential victory to the rousing EU anthem two years ago. His pro-Europe vision has collided with populists and national interests across the continent. And at home, his political vision has given rise to France's raucous yellow vest uprising over his government's pro-business policies.\n\nMacron wanted the May 23-26 European Parliament elections to be the key moment that he could push his ambitions for a stronger Europe -- but instead, nationalists and populists who criticized the 28-nation bloc could achieve unprecedented success.\n\nThey argue that EU leaders have failed to manage migration into the continent and remain out of touch with ordinary workers' concerns.\n\n\"We have a crisis of the European Union. This is a matter of fact. Everywhere in Europe, when you look at the past five to six years, in our country but in a lot of countries, all the extremes, extreme-rights, are increasing,\" Macron said Thursday, making an unexpected appeal for European unity on the sidelines of a technology trade show.\n\n\"On currency, on digital, on climate action, we need more Europe,\" he said. \"I want the EU to be more protective of our borders regarding migration, terrorism and so on, but I think if you fragment Europe, there is no chance you have a stronger Europe.\"\n\nIn person, the 41-year-old Macron comes across as strikingly, sincerely European. A political centrist, he's at ease quoting Greek playwrights, German thinkers or British economists. France's youngest president grew up with the EU and has been using the shared European euro currency his whole adult life, and sees it as Europe's only chance to stay in the global economic game.\n\nMacron has already visited 20 of the EU's 28 countries in his two years in office, and while he acknowledges the EU's problems, he wants to fix the bloc -- not disassemble it.\n\nMacron won the 2017 presidential election over France's far-right, anti-immigration party leader Marine Le Pen on a pledge to make Europe stronger to face global competition against the Unites States and China. Since then, he's had to make compromises with other EU leaders -- and clashed with some nations where populist parties govern, from Poland to neighboring Italy.\n\nFour months after his election, Macron outlined his vision for Europe in a sweeping speech at Paris' Sorbonne university, calling for a joint EU budget, shared military forces and harmonized taxes.\n\nBut with Brexit looming and nationalism rising, Macron has had to reconsider his ambitions. He called his political tactics with other EU leaders a \"productive confrontation.\"\n\n\"In Europe, what is expected from France is to clearly say what it wants, its goals, its ambitions, and then be able to build a compromise with Germany to move forward\" with other European countries, Macron said last week.\n\nMacron stressed that despite her initial reluctance, German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed last year to create a eurozone budget they hope will boost investment and provide a safety mechanism for the 19 nations using the euro currency.\n\nIn March, Macron sought to draw support for a Europe of \"freedom, protection and progress\" with a written call to voters in 28 countries to reject nationalist parties that \"offer nothing.\"\n\nAnd he proposed to define a roadmap for the EU by the end of this year in a discussion with all member nations and a panel of European citizens.\n\n\"There will be disagreement, but is it better to have a static Europe or a Europe that advances, sometimes at different paces, and that is open to all?\" he asked.\n\nFrance and Germany are the two heavyweights in Europe, and Macron can also count on cooperation from pro-European governments of Belgium, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and others.\n\nHe has made a point, however, of not yet visiting Hungary or Poland, two nations led by populist leaders whom Macron accused last year of \"lying\" to their people about the EU.\n\nFrance has also been entangled in a serious diplomatic crisis with Italy over migration into Europe. Italy's anti-migrant Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has repeatedly criticized Macron and is backing his rival Le Pen's National Rally party in the election this week that aims to fill the European parliament's 751 seats.\n\nMacron has little chance to repeat Europe-wide what he did in France: rip up the political map by building a powerful centrist movement that weakened the traditional left and right.\n\nThe campaign for Macron's Republic on the Move party is being led by former European Affairs Minister Nathalie Loiseau under a banner called \"Renaissance.\" The party wants to associate with the pro-market ALDE alliance to create new centrist group at the European Parliament.\n\nBut across the continent, the centrists are not expected to come out remotely on top but rank third or even lower behind the parliament's traditional two biggest groups, the right-wing European People's Party and the left-wing Socialists and Democrats group.\n\nEven at home, Macron is far from certain of being able to claim victory in the European vote. Polls suggest his party will be among France's top two vote-getters in the election, which takes place in France on May 26.\n\nBut its main rival, the far-right National Rally party, is determined to take revenge on Macron beating Le Pen so decisively in 2017.\n\nMacron's political opponents across the spectrum are calling on French voters to seize the European vote to reject his government's policies.\n\nWhile he won 64% of the presidential vote in 2017, French polls show that Macron's popularity has been around half that for the past year.\n\nIt reached record lows when France's yellow vest movement broke out last fall, demanding relief from high taxes and stagnant wages for French workers, then slightly rose as extensive violence during yellow vest protests, especially in Paris, dampened support for the movement's cause.\n\nStill, the yellow vests are not going away. New protests against Macron and his government are planned for the EU election day.\n\n___\n\nCatherine Gaschka in Paris contributed to the story\n\n___\n\nFor more news from The Associated Press on the European Parliament elections, go to https://www.apnews.com/EuropeanParliament\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Days earlier, Ms. Le Pen was accused of making a white supremacist hand gesture in a selfie with an ultranationalist politician from Estonia. Before that, Mr. Salvini yucked it up with Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, Europe's proud \"illiberal democrat,'' beside a barbed wire border fence erected to block migrants.\n\nThe messaging is anything but subtle: The far-right populists of the European Union are banding together for a frontal assault on the political establishment in this week's elections for the European Parliament. The races are seen as the best barometer of just how angry and alienated Europe really is -- and just how broadly populists of various stripes can break through after years of gaining political strength.\n\n\"For the first time, we'll see meaningful populist representation at the European level,\" said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe for the Eurasia Group, \"so there is at least a risk of a populist insurgency trying to take over or paralyze institutions from within, with implications for Europe's capacity to act.\"\n\nPopulists are not expected to win the biggest number of the Parliament's 751 seats, let alone a majority. The flurry of campaign photo ops may also prove to be misleading: Egos and differing agendas could interfere once it comes time for the various populist parties to create legislative coalitions and act with discipline. Still, analysts predict a major electoral breakthrough that is certain to disrupt European politics.\n\nAnd for now, the vote has set up a stark contrast: Even as the populists are playing to anger and nationalism, mainstream leaders are trying to sell their apathetic voters on maintaining the course. President Emmanuel Macron of France, who embodies the pro-Europe establishment, argues that \"more Europe\" is needed, not less.\n\n\"This election is between the builders and the breakers,\" said Marietje Schaake, a liberal Dutch legislator. \"Will people come out to vote because they know what's at stake?\"\n\nA Stark Political Divide\n\nThe European Union is a colossus, a federation of 28 nations (including Brexit-paralyzed Britain) that constitutes the world's biggest single market and has more than 500 million citizens. But it is still a political work in progress, led by national leaders working as a collective, with a large, rivalrous and unelected executive branch in Brussels. The elections every five years for the European Parliament are considered the truest test of public attitudes toward the bloc.\n\nEuropean politics have been fragmenting since the financial crisis of 2008, and populist anger deepened after an influx of migrants from Africa and the Middle East, reviving some of the Continent's oldest and ugliest impulses. Anti-Semitism is rising. Anti-elite and anti-immigrant sentiments remain acute. Nationalist and identitarian movements are gaining clout, while once marginalized neo-fascist parties have become more vocal.\n\nYet if the populists once vowed to shatter the European Union, they have softened their agenda to match public attitudes. Polls in member states, minus Britain, show that voters, if unhappy with their current circumstances, want to change the bloc rather than destroy it, which is why leaders like Mr. Salvini and Ms. Le Pen talk about altering the European Union from within.\n\nInvoking hot-button issues like migration, terrorism and Islamophobia, far-right and far-left populists place blame on remote bureaucrats in Brussels and call for devolving more power to national governments. They hope the election will both gum up Brussels and give them extra leverage in domestic politics, which is what many of them care most about.\n\nOn the campaign trail, the populists have dominated news media attention. Mr. Salvini, Italy's powerful deputy prime minister, is campaigning so often that critics say he is almost never at work. A bevy of photographers documented his meeting with Mr. Orban along the Serbia-Hungary border, as the two men hoisted themselves up into a watchtower to stare across the empty frontier with binoculars -- the way American officials like to stare at North Korea from Panmunjom.\n\n\"To defend the borders and the safety of our children,\" Mr. Salvini tweeted, as he urged a vote for his party, the populist League.\n\nPopulists Ascendant, but Can They Get Along?\n\nThe question is whether voters are still animated by migration and the clash-of-civilizations rhetoric often used by Mr. Salvini and Mr. Orban. As important is whether the varied populists, assuming they win a sizable number of seats, can coalesce into a powerful coalition. That part is very doubtful.\n\nMr. Salvini recently announced an alliance of populist, far-right, anti-immigration, euroskeptic parties called \"Toward a Europe of Common Sense.\" But if he hopes such a coalition can become the largest bloc in the Parliament, the prospects are dim, partly because of a clash of egos and agendas among different populist parties. At the founding event for his alliance, Mr. Salvini produced only three other parties as partners -- the Danish People's Party, the Alternative for Germany and the Finns party, which just came in second in Finland's national elections, with some 17.5 percent of the vote.\n\nOpinion polls suggest that populist parties could win up to 180 seats in European Parliament, enough to create serious delays and difficulties in the next Parliament, in which the center-right and center-left are expected to lose their traditional majority. Ms. Schaake, the Dutch legislator, said that \"the real story is fragmentation and what will happen in the center.\" The populists will not agree on everything, she said.\n\n\"But they can make a mess.\"\n\nIn addition to passing or rejecting laws, European lawmakers have new powers that could allow populists to block trade deals, approve the bloc's budget and play an important role in determining who will replace the European Union's most powerful leaders: Jean-Claude Juncker, the current president of the European Commission; Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council; and Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank.\n\nEven if they are replaced by others from the pro-European mainstream, countries led by euroskeptics, like Italy, Hungary and Poland, will get to nominate powerful commissioners, which could mean more squabbling at the top and a shift away from federalism.\n\nThe potential for polarization will reach into the Commission, too, said Daniela Schwarzer, director of the German Council on Foreign Relations. \"Who will Orban and Salvini send as commissioners?\" she asked. \"And the scrutiny of candidates by Parliament will be tougher.\" Parliament has the right to scrutinize commissioners and to endorse or reject the whole slate.\n\nVoters, meanwhile, are unpredictable. Turnout is usually low in European races, which gives advantages to motivated, more narrowly focused populist parties. A study of the electorate by the European Council on Foreign Relations found Europe's voters more volatile than polarized. Immigration, the main topic for many populists, ranked only third among European voter concerns, behind Islamic radicalism, much of it homegrown, and the national economy.\n\n\"Swathes of voters,\" said Mark Leonard, the council's director, \"are moving fluidly between parties of the right and left.\"\n\nIndeed, if many voters are attracted to the populists, the study showed that many others are terrified of them, and the growing nationalist sentiment.\n\nA Brexit Mess\n\nOne main reason is the ongoing mess over Brexit. Britain was supposed to be out of the European Union at the end of March, long before these elections. But the shambolic impasse in Westminster has continued, forcing Britons to participate in elections for a European Parliament that three years ago they voted to leave.\n\nBrexit, however, has cut both ways. While it has shown euroskeptics how difficult and costly it is to leave the bloc, British participation in these elections is benefiting the euroskeptics and the populists. The main winner so far is the beer-swilling English nationalist, Nigel Farage, whose new Brexit Party is making huge gains at the expense of both mainstream parties, the Conservatives and Labour.\n\nFor as long as Britain remains inside the European Union -- at least until the latest extension of Halloween it seems -- Mr. Farage's party will swell the ranks and influence of populists in the European Parliament, where Britain has roughly 10 percent of the seats, while Labour members will aid the Socialist bloc.\n\nWith Prime Minister Theresa May on her way out, Britain could then be led by a fervent Brexiter like Boris Johnson, who would only make mainstream Europeans more anxious about the future -- including the next seven-year budget. It may even make a \"no-deal Brexit\" more attractive to Brussels -- even if a majority in the British Parliament does not want one.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_erlanger@nytimes.com", "name": "Steven Erlanger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/world/xxeu-vote1/xxeu-vote1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4797304", "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 295946340}, {"uri": "1139429404", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-18", "time": "19:46:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-18T19:46:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4313725531101227, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/opinion/steve-bannon-matteo-salvini.html", "title": "Opinion | Steve Bannon Is a Fan of Italy's Donald Trump", "body": "MILAN -- Italy is a political laboratory. During the Cold War, the question was whether the United States could keep the Communists from power. Then Italy produced Silvio Berlusconi and scandal-ridden showman politics long before the United States elected Donald Trump. Now, on the eve of European Parliament elections likely to result in a rightist lurch, it has an anti-immigrant, populist government whose strongman, Matteo Salvini, known to his followers as \"the Captain,\" is the Continent's most seductive exponent of the new illiberalism.\n\nSteve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, has been close to Salvini for a while. That's no surprise. Bannon is the foremost theorist and propagator of the global nationalist, anti-establishment backlash. He's Trotsky to the Populist International. He sensed the disease eating at Western democracies -- a globalized elite's abandonment of the working class and the hinterland -- before anyone. He spurred a revolt to make the invisible citizen visible and to save Western manufacturing jobs from what he calls the Chinese \"totalitarian economic hegemon.\"\n\nNow Bannon is crisscrossing Europe ahead of the elections, held Thursday through next Sunday. He's in Berlin one day, Paris the next. As he explained during several recent conversations and a meeting in New York, he believes that \"Europe is six months to a year ahead of the United States on everything.\" As with Brexit's foreshadowing of Trump's election, a victory for the right in Europe \"will energize our base for 2020.\" The notion of Wisconsin galvanized by Brussels may seem far-fetched, but then so did a President Trump.\n\nPolls indicate that Salvini's League party, transformed from a northern secessionist movement into the national face of the xenophobic right, will get over 30 percent of the Italian vote, up from 6.2 percent in 2014. Anti-immigrant and Euroskeptic parties look set to make the greatest gains, taking as many as 35 percent of the seats in Parliament, which influences European Union policy for more than a half-billion people. In France, Marine Le Pen's nationalists are running neck-and-neck with President Emmanuel Macron's pro-Europe party. In Britain, Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party has leapt ahead of the center-right and center-left.\n\nSalvini, whose party formed a government a year ago with the out-with-the-old-order Five Star Movement, is a central figure in this shift. The coalition buried mainstream parties. He is, Bannon told me, \"the most important guy on the stage right now -- he's charismatic, plain-spoken, and he understands the machinery of government. His rallies are as intense as Trump's. Italy is the center of politics -- a country that has embraced nationalism against globalism, shattered the stereotypes, blown past the old paradigm of left and right.\"\n\nFor all the upheaval, I found Italy intact, still tempering transactional modernity with humanity, still finding in beauty consolation for dysfunction. The new right has learned from the past. It does not disappear people. It does not do mass militarization. It's subtler. It scapegoats migrants, instills fear, glorifies an illusory past (what the Polish sociologist Zygmunt Bauman called \"retrotopia\"), exalts machismo, mocks do-gooder liberalism and turns the angry drumbeat of social media into its hypnotic minute-by-minute mass rally.\n\nSalvini, the suave savior, is everywhere other than in his interior minister's office at Rome's Viminale Palace. He's out at rallies or at the local cafe in his trademark blue \"Italia\" sweatshirt. He's at village fairs and conventions. He's posting on Facebook up to 30 times a day to his 3.7 million followers, more than any other European politician. (Macron has 2.6 million followers.) He's burnishing the profile of the tough young pol (he's 46) who keeps migrants out, loosens gun laws, brandishes a sniper rifle and winks at Fascism -- all leavened with Mr.-Nice-Guy images of him sipping espresso or a Barolo.\n\nHis domination of the headlines is relentless. When, during my visit, a woman was gang raped near Viterbo, his call for \"chemical castration\" of the perpetrators led the news cycle for 24 hours. Like Trump, he's a master of saying the unsayable to drown out the rest.\n\n\"I find Salvini repugnant, but he seems to have an incredible grip on society,\" Nathalie Tocci, the director of Italy's Institute of International Relations, told me. No wonder then that the European far-right has chosen Milan for its big pre-election rally, bringing together Salvini, Le Pen, J\u00f6rg Meuthen of the Alternative for Germany party and many other rightist figures.\n\n\"The European elections will be decisive for the future of our continent,\" Macron warned in a manifesto called \"For European Renewal.\" That's probably an exaggeration, but none has ever felt this important, precisely because European integration, the foundation of postwar peace, and liberal democracy itself seem vulnerable. \"Nationalist retrenchment offers nothing,\" Macron declared. The Brexit fiasco is Exhibit A in that argument. Still, Macron's proposal for the creation of a \"European Agency for the Protection of Democracies\" speaks volumes about where we are.\n\nA nationalist tide is still rising. \"We need to mobilize,\" Bannon told me. \"This is not an era of persuasion, it's an era of mobilization. People now move in tribes. Persuasion is highly overrated.\"\n\nBannon gives the impression of a man trying vainly to keep up with the intergalactic speed of his thoughts. Ideas cascade. He offered me a snap dissection of American politics: blue-collar families were suckers: their sons and daughters went off to die in unwon wars; their equity evaporated with the 2008 meltdown, destroyed by \"financial weapons of mass destruction\"; their jobs migrated to China. All that was needed was somebody to adopt a new vernacular, say to heck with all that, and promise to stop \"unlimited illegal immigration\" and restore American greatness. His name was Trump. The rest is history.\n\nIn Europe, Bannon said, the backlash brew included several of these same factors. The \"centralized government of Europe\" and its austerity measures, uncontrolled immigration and the sense of people in the provinces that they were \"disposable\" produced the Salvini phenomenon and its look-alikes across the Continent.\n\n\"In Macron's vision of a United States of Europe, Italy is South Carolina to France's North Carolina,\" Bannon told me. \"But Italy wants to be Italy. It does not want to be South Carolina. The European Union has to be a union of nations.\"\n\nThe fact is Italy is Italy, unmistakably so, with its high unemployment, stagnation, archaic public administration and chasm between the prosperous north (which Salvini's League once wanted to turn into a secessionist state called Padania) and the southern Mezzogiorno. Salvini's coalition has done nothing to solve these problems even as it has demonized immigrants, attacked an independent judiciary and extolled an \"Italians first\" nation.\n\nA federal Europe remains a chimera, even if the euro crisis revealed the need for budgetary integration. Bannon's vision of Brussels bureaucrats devouring national identity for breakfast is largely a straw-man argument, useful for making the European Union the focus of all 21st-century angst.\n\nThe union has delivered peace and stability. It's the great miracle of the second half of the 20th century; no miracle ever marketed itself so badly. It has also suffered from ideological exhaustion, remoteness, division and the failure to agree on an effective shared immigration policy -- opening the way for Salvini's salvos to hit home in a country that is the first stop for many African migrants.\n\nSalvini grew up in Milan in a middle-class family, dropped out of university, joined the League in its early days in the 1990s and was shaped by years working at Radio Padania where he would listen to Italians' gripes. \"What he heard was complaints about immigrants, Europe, the rich,\" Emanuele Fiano, a center-left parliamentarian, told me. \"He's run with that and is now borderline dangerous.\"\n\nThe danger is not exit from the European Union -- the government has come to its senses over that -- or some Fascist reincarnation. It's what Fabrizio Barca, a former minister for territorial cohesion, called the \"Orbanization of the country,\" in a reference to Viktor Orban, the right-wing Hungarian leader. In other words, insidious domination through the evisceration of independent checks and balances, leading Salvini to the kind of stranglehold on power enjoyed by Orban (with a pat on the back from Trump) or by Vladimir Putin. \"The European Union has been ineffective against Orban,\" Barca noted. Worse, it has been feckless.\n\nAnother threat, as in Trump's United States, is of moral collapse. \"I am not a Fascist but. ...\" is a phrase increasingly heard in Italy, with some positive judgment on Mussolini to round off the sentence. Salvini, in the judgment of Claudio Gatti, whose book \"The Demons of Salvini\" was just published in Italian, is \"post-Fascist\" -- he refines many of its methods for a 21st-century audience.\n\nBarca told me the abandonment of rural areas -- the closing of small hospitals, marginal train lines, high schools -- lay behind Salvini's rise. Almost 65 percent of Italian land and perhaps 25 percent of its population have been affected by these cuts. \"Rural areas and the peripheries, the places where people feel like nobody, are home to the League and Five Star,\" he said. To the people there, Salvini declares: I will defend you. He does not offer a dream. He offers protection -- mainly against the concocted threat of migrants, whose numbers were in fact plummeting before he took office because of an agreement reached with Libya.\n\nThe great task before the parties of the center-left and center-right that will most likely be battered in this election is to reconnect. They must restore a sense of recognition to the forgotten of globalization. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the socialist Spanish prime minister, just won an important electoral victory after pushing through a 22 percent rise in the minimum wage, the largest in Spain in 40 years. There's a lesson there. The nationalist backlash is powerful, but pro-European liberal sentiment is still stronger. If European elections feel more important, it's also because European identity is growing.\n\nAs for the curiously prescient Italian political laboratory, Bannon is investing in it. He's established an \"Academy for the Judeo-Christian West\" in a 13th-century monastery outside Rome. Its courses, he told me, will include \"history, aesthetics and just plain instruction in how to get stuff done, including facing up to pressure, mock TV interviews with someone from CNN or The Guardian ripping your face off.\"\n\nBannon described himself as an admirer of George Soros -- \"his methods, not his ideology\" -- and the way Soros had built up \"cadres\" throughout Europe. The monastery is the nationalist response to Soros's liberalism. There's a war of ideas going on in Italy and the United States. To shun the fight is to lose it. I am firmly in the liberal camp, but to win it helps to know and strive to understand one's adversary.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Many were sentenced to prison or restricted to halfway houses for 10 years and sometimes more.\n\nBut on Monday, a co-founder of Al Muhajiroun, Anjem Choudary, was photographed near his East London home wearing a long white robe and a black electronic ankle tag. Government officials confirmed that Mr. Choudary, one of the country's most notorious radical Islamist preachers, had been released from a probation hotel after serving more than half of a lengthy prison term for inciting support of the Islamic State.\n\nHe remains under close monitoring, but he has begun the gradual process of becoming a free man. And he is not the only one.\n\nHaving served their time, many members of Mr. Choudary's old network are being released from detention. Far from chastened, they have begun to remobilize, vowing to take on far-right extremists and renew their decades-long campaign to eliminate democracy in Britain and establish a caliphate ruled by Shariah law, according to interviews with a handful of former members.\n\nFounded in 1996, Al Muhajiroun, which has used various names over the years, has spent years effectively taunting the British security forces through its ability to continue operating despite being banned in 2006 for its links to terrorism. After a period of dormancy, the group is now remobilizing by continuing to change its name, adopting lower-profile tactics, using encrypted apps and meeting in secret locations.\n\nAccording to former members, areas where the network is regrouping include East London; Luton, a town north of the British capital; and the surrounding county of Bedfordshire.\n\n\"Muslims are being attacked all over the world,\" said Laith, a former member of Al Muhajiroun who would only give his middle name for fear of prosecution. \"Our mission is much more urgent now, and with Anjem and the other brothers out of jail, it's time to regroup and come out harder than before.\"\n\nFor the British authorities, the possibility of the group's re-emergence is a deep concern. Last week, Andrew Parker, the director general of MI5, Britain's domestic counterintelligence and security agency, issued a rare public warning about the continued risks of extremist networks and emphasized the threat posed by groups sympathetic to the Islamic State.\n\n\"In the U.K., there remain individuals who are inspired\" by Islamic State propaganda, he wrote in the newspaper The Evening Standard, \"despite having shown no interest in traveling to Syria.\"\n\nThe security services have expressed particular alarm at the prospect of a newly energized Al Muhajiroun network trying to recruit members as some ISIS fighters and sympathizers attempt to return to Britain after the fall of the Islamic State's so-called caliphate in Iraq and Syria. Britain has taken a tough line against potential returnees, canceling the passports of more than 150 people.\n\nDavid Videcette, a British former counterterrorism detective, said British citizens who had joined the Islamic State would pose a clear risk if they got back home.\n\n\"Suddenly, we are going to have trained fighters who perhaps have the motivation to carry out martyrdom attacks, exposed to a historical network of radicals,\" he said.\n\nFor now, Mr. Choudary is prohibited from speaking in public or from connecting with his old network. But several former members said that his release from prison, along with that of other figures, had emboldened the group, which was linked to 25 percent of all Islamist terrorism-related convictions in Britain between 1998 and 2015.\n\n\"Some activists have started to meet again and are testing the waters as they re-engage with their activism,\" said Michael Kenney, an associate professor of international affairs at the University of Pittsburgh, who spent years embedded with the group as part of the research for his book, \"The Islamic State in Britain.\"\n\nIt is hard to overstate the role Mr. Choudary has played in motivating Islamic extremists. Just last week, for instance, the BBC reported that one of the attackers behind the Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka, Abdul Lathief Jameel Mohamed, was radicalized by Mr. Choudary after attending his sermons during a one-year study abroad program in 2006.\n\n\"No other British citizen has had so much influence over so many terrorists as Choudary,\" said Nick Lowles, the chief executive of a British anti-racist watchdog group, Hope Not Hate, which he says has identified 120 Islamist militants with links to the imam.\n\nA representative of the British Home Office, which has responsibility for monitoring extremist groups, said that the government was aware of the potential threat posed by Mr. Choudary and Al Muhajiroun, and had rigorous procedures in place to handle it.\n\n\"When any terrorist offender is released from prison, we know about it and have robust covert and overt powers to investigate and manage any threat they may pose,\" the government representative said. \"Those released on license remain subject to close monitoring and strict conditions, which if breached can see them go back to prison.\"\n\nMost of those who were senior members of Al Muhajiroun said that they remained under strict surveillance, with their electronic communications monitored, which was confirmed by the Home Office. As a result, they say they carry out their activities discreetly, and avoid any mention of or association with the group's former name.\n\nThe activists say they have shifted their recruitment tactics from provocative public preaching and demonstrations to secret internet forums and smaller group meetings in inconspicuous locations. If the group uses a name that has not been identified as that of a terrorist outfit, then the gatherings are legal.\n\nMost members of the group abide by what they call a \"covenant of security\" that prohibits attacks on non-Muslims in their country of residence. But it is a matter of individual choice.\n\nIn recent years, group members have become increasingly influenced by foreign radical groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, inspiring them to carry out the attacks on and near London Bridge in 2017 and the murder of a British soldier, Lee Rigby, in the capital in 2013.\n\nFor many years, Mr. Choudary, a former lawyer whose preaching emphasized a jihadist ideology in which the West was accused of victimizing Muslims, managed to stay out of prison even as the authorities shut down many members of his broader network.\n\n\"Decrease and destruct, that was their tactic, and I have to admit it worked,\" said Mohammed Shamsuddin, who was recruited to Al Muhajiroun by Mr. Choudary more than 20 years ago.\n\nSipping on a latte at a juice bar in a town in northwestern England, Mr. Shamsuddin said that the authorities could no longer crack down in the same way.\n\n\"Now, all the guys you arrested 10 years ago are being released into the open,\" he said, \"and they are healthier and stronger than before, and it's come at a time when the police are stretched and Brexit is destroying the country.\"\n\nMany of the senior activists of the network who are now regrouping were monitored under the government's Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act of 2011. That legislation provides the framework for a program that restricts the movements of individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activities, through the use of electronic tags and overnight house arrest.\n\nSome, however, said that being placed under the program's restrictions had been more like a long vacation.\n\n\"It was amazing,\" said a man who was subjected to the restrictions, flashing a picture of a brick property with a garden. \"I was placed in a four-bedroom house by myself in the nicest part of Ipswich,\" a town in eastern England.\n\n\"If anything, I got a good rest after years of hard work, got my energy back,\" he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not legally allowed to talk about the program. \"They spent all that money to achieve what in the end? I'm back on Twitter, back on Facebook, back with my brothers. I'm back in society, doing my thing.\"\n\nSome activists in the network denied that Mr. Choudary had encouraged acts of terrorism, claiming that he had directed their energy into an ideological struggle, not a violent one.\n\n\"The British government made a big mistake by putting Anjem in jail,\" said Abdulla Muhid, a 42-year-old former member of Al Muhajiroun. \"He believes in the covenant of security and was able to control the youth as they were getting their education from a learned person. Now, everyone is freelancing, getting radicalized through the internet.\"\n\nIt is not clear how many activists belong to the network formerly known as Al Muhajiroun. Even during the group's peak years in the late 1990s to early 2000s, it never had more than 200 dedicated members, according to Mr. Kenney of the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nIt is also unclear whether Mr. Choudary will reassert his leadership when his license conditions end in 2021. There have been group members who have challenged his leadership in the past, and some of those who are still active in the network suggested that he had been replaced. Still, many said that they were eagerly awaiting his return.\n\n\"People are waiting for Anjem to come out; they are waiting for that spark,\" the activist who recently emerged from the restriction program said.\n\n\"These monitoring programs will do one of two things to you,\" he added. \"Either they will break you or make you hard-core. For me, I'm now rested and feeling more hard-core. I'm ready.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ceylan_yeginsu@nytimes.com", "name": "Ceylan Yeginsu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/world/19choudary/xxchoudary1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 295861800}, {"uri": "1138692594", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-17", "time": "16:55:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-17T16:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/books/review/upheaval-jared-diamond.html", "title": "What to Do When You're a Country in Crisis", "body": "UPHEAVAL Turning Points for Nations in Crisis\n\nBy Jared Diamond\n\nIf you've ever been at a wedding or conference or on board a United connection from O'Hare, and been cornered by a man with Theories About It All, and you came away thinking, \"That was a great experience,\" have I got the book for you.\n\nJared Diamond's \"Upheaval\" belongs to the genre of 30,000-foot books, which sell an explanation of everything. I travel often and see them a lot: at airport bookstores, where Steven Pinker and Yuval Noah Harari (both of whom blurbed \"Upheaval\") and Diamond, of course, deserve permanent shelves; and in the air, where I've noticed that a pretty disproportionate fraction of readers who read in the quiet of 30,000 feet have a preference for writers who write from the viewpoint of 30,000 feet.\n\nSo I dug into Diamond's latest, intrigued by his thesis that the way individual humans cope with crisis might teach something to countries. Then, before long, the first mistake caught my eye; soon, the 10th. Then graver ones. Errors, along with generalizations, blind spots and oversights, that called into question the choice to publish. I began to wonder why we give some people, and only some, the platform, and burden, to theorize about everything.\n\nThe theory proposed by Diamond -- a professor of geography at the University of California at Los Angeles and the author of several books, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Guns, Germs and Steel\" -- is interesting. Human beings go through personal crises all the time. We know a lot about how people change in order to cope -- or fail to. What if we applied those lessons to countries in quagmires?\n\n[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of May. See the full list. ]\n\nDrawing on the work of therapists, Diamond reports that the key for individuals coping with a crisis is \"selective change.\" People who successfully overcome a problem tend to identify and isolate it, figuring out \"which parts of their identities are already functioning well and don't need changing, and which parts are no longer working and do need changing.\" Diamond asks, Could the same be true for countries? He believes so, and he seeks to test his theory by adapting a dozen factors known to affect the resolution of personal crises to national crises. Some factors translate easily -- just as people must first accept being in crisis, nations must first come to a consensus about their woes. Other analogies feel more strained -- help from your close friends translates into material and financial aid from allies. Armed with this framework, Diamond sets out to see how well it fits countries' actual histories.\n\nDiamond's method is the case study. Looking at Finland, Japan, Chile, Indonesia, Germany, Australia and the United States at pivotal moments in their histories, he evaluates their courses of action with reference to his 12 bullet points. Meiji-era Japan, needing to open up to the world while preserving its cultural core, found a way \"to adopt many Western features, but to modify them to suit Japanese circumstances.\" After World War II, Germany worked its way to taking full responsibility for its actions and thereby successfully transformed itself. America, in part because it shrugs off the lessons of other places, struggles to resolve its issues.\n\nAt the end of each chapter, each mini-history, Diamond pauses to ask some variant of: \"How does Indonesia's crisis fit into our framework?\" And this is a tell. The Framework is driving the inquiry here, and everything stands at its service. The people we encounter are seldom richly portrayed, because only The Framework matters. The stories we learn about each country are often partial and slanted, because only The Framework matters. Countries where racism and tolerance, sexism and equality have long been in tension are portrayed as being entirely one thing before magically becoming the opposite thing, because The Framework can only process monoliths.\n\nWith a focus on The Framework, facts recede in importance. The book is riddled with errors. Diamond gets wrong the year of the Brexit vote. He claims that, under President Ronald Reagan, \"government shutdowns were nonexistent.\" But they occurred a number of times. He describes Australian-rules football as a sport \"invented in Australia and played nowhere else.\" But it is played elsewhere -- in Nauru, where it is the national sport, as well as in China, Canada, France, Japan, Ireland and the United States, according to the Australian Football League.\n\nDiamond says a 1976 terrorist attack in Washington, D.C., targeting a former Chilean official, was \"the only known case of a foreign terrorist killing an American citizen on American soil -- until the World Trade Towers attack of 2001.\" This claim wholly overlooks the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, in which six people died. He refers to Lee Kuan Yew as \"Singapore's prime minister,\" even though he no longer occupies that role, not least because he's dead.\n\nThen the generalizations: hoo boy. At one point during World War II, Diamond says, the people of Finland, facing Soviet bellicosity, \"were unanimous in refusing to compromise further.\" A whole nation, unanimous! We learn of another instance of 100 percent society-wide agreement down under, where \"Australians debating the federal constitution argued about many matters but were unanimous about excluding all nonwhite races from Australia.\" But in fact they argued about this issue, too, and one framer, Andrew Inglis Clark, the Tasmanian attorney general, sought, unsuccessfully, to introduce an adapted version of the American 14th Amendment, which would have prohibited discrimination by race.\n\nIn claiming that Germany has become more socially liberal, Diamond claims, \"There is no spanking of children; in fact, it's now forbidden by law!\" But how can a serious thinker confuse the passage of a law with fidelity to it? An organization that tracks the efficacy of the law has found its enactment to have reduced, but hardly ended hitting. To read Diamond is also to learn, apparently, how all Chileans identify (with Europe and the United States, not Latin America); and how all \"Indonesians take their national identity for granted.\" (Except, perhaps, the separatist groups?)\n\nSometimes the book feels written from a drying well of lifelong research rather than from the latest facts. For example, Diamond tells us Americans have always been a highly mobile people and are \"unlikely\" to \"move less often.\" He must be unfamiliar with the rather well-publicized new data declaring the opposite: \"Fewer Americans Are Moving to Pursue Better Jobs Across the Nation,\" NPR says, citing the Census Bureau's research that the number of Americans who move in a given year has dropped by half since the 1940s.\n\nThere are far more of these errors than I have space to list, too many to dismiss this calling-out as nit-picking. And they matter because of the book's nature. If we can't trust you on the little and medium things, how can we trust you where authors of 30,000-foot books really need our trust -- on the big, hard-to-check claims? On how the end of the White Australia policy \"resulted from five considerations.\" (Not four, not six, and the ones you happen to name.) On how Finns' love of their language is what made them willing to fight and die for Finland. On how Tokyo is clean \"because Japanese children learn to be clean and to clean up\" (and not, for example, because the city spends 3.9 percent of its budget on public health and sanitation, according to a quick search, compared with the 1.9 percent of New York City's 2018 budget that went to the Department of Sanitation).\n\nWhile \"Upheaval\" does list sources in the back, Diamond seldom quotes books. He is far fonder of quoting his many friends. \"Why does Japan pursue these stances? My Japanese friends suggest three explanations.\" That's what we're going with? Or he describes \"the 1973 coup that many of my Chilean friends characterize as inevitable.\" First of all, why are we paying you to hear your friends' random theories? Second of all, how can a coup ever be inevitable? You mean to say that a plot as delicate as that could under no scenario have gone wrong?\n\nSince we're talking about our friends, I know so many younger writers, especially women and people of color, who are smart, thoughtful, buttoned up and pretty damn accurate who would kill for an opening to publish a book with a serious publisher -- and who know in their bones that, if they were ever this sloppy, their career would be over before it had even begun.\n\nThere is also a systemic issue here. The time has come for those of us who work in book-length nonfiction to insist that professional fact-checking become as inalienable from publishing as publicity, marketing and jacket design -- and at the publisher's expense rather than as a cost passed on to the author, who, understandably, will often choose to spend her money on health care. In the age of tweets, it cannot be the fate of the book to become ever more tweetlike -- maybe factual, maybe whatever. The book must stand apart, must stand above.\n\nA remaining problem with \"Upheaval\" is one that cannot be fact-checked away, but, happily, is already being fixed across the world of letters. Until recently, in much of American life, and American writing, the default setting of human being was white and/or male. Today so much writing shatters this default, complicates the point of view. And \"Upheaval\" reminds us why that matters.\n\nWhen Diamond describes \"highly egalitarian social values\" as an ethos that has \"remained unchanged\" in Australia, despite having written a chapter about the country's history of legalized racism, he is using a definition of egalitarian that applies only to white people. When he says, \"Social status in Japan depends more on education than on heredity and family connection,\" he is ignoring what it means to be born a woman. \"Of course, my list of U.S. problems isn't exhaustive,\" he admits. \"Problems that I don't discuss include race relations and the role of women.\" You know, the problems affecting the vast majority of Americans.\n\nI almost felt bad for Diamond when, toward the end, he described \"an evening with two women friends, one of them a psychologically na\u00efve optimist in her 20s, the other a perceptive person in her 70s.\" What made the young woman \"psychologically na\u00efve\" to him was that she dated someone who it took her time to see was terrible. (If that's a crime, jail us all.) I felt a strange sympathy for Diamond, who is in his early 80s, because clearly he didn't realize how tone-deaf it is, in 2019, for an established male author to go around labeling a young woman making pretty normal life mistakes as \"psychologically na\u00efve.\" But Diamond is proud to be from another time. He tells us his manuscripts are typed by someone else, he relies on his wife and secretary to use a computer, and he clings to the belief that video games are \"solitary,\" even if massively multiplayer online games are where a growing number of Americans go to be social. He also thinks phones are ruining America because people check them every four minutes. But I have to say, I was doing just that while reading his book, and I was doing it because so many things I read didn't sound accurate, and I, for one, think it's an improvement when 30,000-foot authority can be challenged by Googling from bed.\n\nOn a beach some time ago, I read Jill Lepore's new history of the United States, \"These Truths.\" It is no less ambitious than \"Upheaval.\" But it is a new kind of big book for a new age. We know so much more now. We know the stories that haven't been told, the points of view that have been neglected. Lepore manages to tell many stories, ever shifting her own perspective. She has no pat Framework, no bullet-point theory to test. She tells earthy stories about people famous and obscure, and she is confident enough to let the ideas emerge.

(Toby Melville/Reuters)\n\nFor the last six weeks, May and Corbyn have engaged in cross-party talks in hopes of finding a compromise that could break the Brexit deadlock and win a vote in Parliament.\n\nMany saw it as doomed from the start -- and a cynical play for time by both sides.\n\nOn Friday, Corbyn pulled the plug.\n\nLabour said that they were uncomfortable striking a deal with a Conservative leader who could be gone within weeks.\n\n\"The increasing weakness and instability of your government means there cannot be confidence in securing whatever might be agreed between us,\" Corbyn wrote.\n\nMay's position as prime minister is as precarious as it's ever been. Her Conservative Party received a drubbing in local elections earlier this month and is expected to do poorly in next week's European Parliament elections, with the opinion polls suggesting the Tories will get trounced by Nigel Farage's upstart Brexit Party.\n\n[In what may be Britain's last European election, Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party is expected to dominate]\n\nMay has agreed to discuss a timetable for her departure after Parliament votes on Brexit legislation in the first week of June.\n\nIf she defies the odds and wins that vote, it would be the political comeback of the century. If she loses, then plans could be made for her orderly departure.\n\nBut just because the starting gun hasn't been fired on the leadership race to succeed May doesn't mean that it's not already happening, at least unofficially.\n\nOn Thursday, Boris Johnson, Britain's ambitious former foreign secretary and a leading Brexiteer, said what everybody in Westminster knew already: He was going for it.\n\nA Tory leadership contest for a new prime minister could last several months. From a possible field of a dozen candidates, Conservative lawmakers will narrow the race to two, and then the 125,000 Tory members will get their pick. The vote does not go to the general public.\n\nIn his letter to the prime minister, Corbyn said their Brexit talks had \"gone as far as they can\" and that the race to find her successor had undermined the process.\n\nHe added that \"while there are some areas where compromise has been possible, we have been unable to bridge important policy gaps between us.\"\n\nCorbyn's Labour sought the softest sort of Brexit, one that would have kept Britain so closely aligned with E.U. customs rules and tariffs that it probably would have forbade it from seeing its own independent trade deals with countries like the United States, China and India. That was a red line for May -- and a Brexit that hard-liners would never approve.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in Bristol, May blamed the failure of the talks on Labour's position on Brexit, which many find ambiguous.\n\nAlthough the two sides did find some common ground, May said, \"We haven't been able to overcome the fact that there isn't a common position in Labour about whether they want to deliver Brexit, or hold a second referendum, which could reverse it.\"\n\nIt was long expected that talks between May and Corbyn would be likely to end in tears.\n\nStriking a deal risked tearing apart both the Conservatives and Labour Party, both of which have factions that would be deeply uncomfortable with a compromise.\n\nOn Labour's side, there were critics who were uneasy about being seen to help deliver Brexit, and on the Conservative side, there were those who disliked Labour's key demand for a customs arrangement with the European bloc.\n\nAsked if he could do business with someone like Boris Johnson as prime minister, Corbyn told the BBC: \"Whoever the Tory Party decide is going to be the leader we will put our case and we will challenge them.\"\n\nBritish voters with Brexit on their minds punish main parties in local elections\n\nBrexit: Parliament rejects soft Brexit, second referendum", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OnUjmVWb-tq2QLJP-NHqbIDH8r8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OXVDEATYVUI6TPJFZGEVKXTXMY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4792797", "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 295801260}, {"uri": "1138600790", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-17", "time": "14:48:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-17T14:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/world/europe/jeremy-corbyn-theresa-may.html", "title": "Jeremy Corbyn Halts Brexit Talks With Theresa May", "body": "LONDON -- Bipartisan talks on extricating Britain from the European Union collapsed on Friday, when the opposition Labour Party pulled out, ending the latest attempt to salvage the beleaguered Brexit process and leaving it in a familiar state of deadlock.\n\nIn a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, wrote that the negotiations \"have now gone as far as they can.\"\n\nFor weeks, discussions between ministers in the Conservative government and senior Labour figures had failed to break the Brexit impasse, which has wrecked the leadership of Prime Minister Theresa May and provoked a sharp backlash against both major parties from disenchanted voters, who vented their anger in recent local elections.\n\nMrs. May has been unable to unite her party behind the Brexit agreement she negotiated with the European Union, leading her to turn to Labour for support. But that has produced nothing except increasingly urgent calls from fellow Conservatives for her to step down.\n\nOn Thursday, she announced that she would set out a timetable for her departure next month, and Conservatives whose Brexit views are even further from Labour's are vying to succeed her.\n\nWhile the talks have been conducted in good faith, \"we have been unable to bridge important policy gaps between us,\" Mr. Corbyn wrote in his letter. \"Even more crucially, the increasing weakness and instability of your government means there cannot be confidence in securing whatever might be agreed between us.\"\n\nThe breakdown came as little surprise, since both parties are badly split on Brexit, and neither leader has much room to maneuver. Many Conservative lawmakers were angry about the talks with Labour, and many Labour lawmakers had voiced discontent at taking part in negotiations designed to help salvage Mrs. May's tenure by getting Brexit over the line.\n\nMrs. May blamed the opposition's divisions for the failure of the talks. The problem, she said at a campaign stop in Bristol, was that Labour could not decide \"whether they want to deliver Brexit or hold a second referendum.\"\n\nThe collapse is yet another setback to a prime minister who had already suffered a remarkable string of defeats and has been hounded by members of her own party to leave. Parliament has voted three times to reject her Brexit plan, which would keep Britain closely tied to the European Union at least until the end of 2020 but then extract it from the bloc's main economic structures. She said earlier this week that she would attempt a fourth vote on her plan early next month.\n\nMrs. May had hoped to lure Labour with the prospect that Britain could stay -- at least temporarily -- in a type of customs union with the bloc, thereby eliminating the need for tariffs and many border checks on goods flowing between Britain and continental Europe.\n\nBut that did not prove enough to tempt Labour, which is in favor or retaining closer ties to the European Union to protect the economy. It had argued that Mrs. May had not offered enough concessions and that, in any case, her successor might be a hard-line Brexit supporter who would tear up any agreement.\n\nNext week Britons will vote in elections to the European Parliament on May 23, almost three years after they voted in a referendum to quit the bloc.\n\nMrs. May now has to gird herself for the European elections next week hat could prove disastrous for both the Conservatives and Labour. One recent poll has them trailing both the Brexit Party, led by the hard-line Brexiteer Nigel Farage, and the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe government is expected to try to seek a consensus in Parliament on the way ahead by holding votes on different options, but previous efforts to do so have failed.\n\nMrs. May wants the Labour Party to agree to abide by the outcome of such votes, but there is little incentive for the opposition to sign up to an outcome that it cannot control. And, without the support of Labour, that process looks doomed to leave Brexit at an impasse.\n\nHowever, pressure on Mrs. May and Mr. Corbyn to reach a deal increased earlier this month, following local elections that were bad for both parties. While the Conservatives lost 1,300 seats in local municipalities, Labour failed to take advantage, shedding around 80 itself.\n\nThough Mr. Corbyn, a lifelong Euroskeptic, argued that a deal needed to be reached, his party's divisions have made that outcome difficult. A very large faction in the Labour Party opposes Brexit and wants a second referendum on any deal, so any agreement with the Conservatives would have risked straining loyalty to a breaking point.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_castle@nytimes.com", "name": "Stephen Castle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/world/17brexit/17brexit-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4792797", "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 295800480}, {"uri": "1138281342", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2019-05-17", "time": "07:43:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-17T07:43:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/eu-citizens-in-uk-have-their-say-on-brexit-in-european-vote/2019/05/17/7936bc10-7870-11e9-a7bf-c8a43b84ee31_story.html", "title": "EU citizens in UK have their say on Brexit in European vote", "body": "By Jill Lawless\u2009|\u2009AP May 17 at 2:55 AM\n\nLONDON -- Hedwig Hegtermans has lived in Britain for two decades, but she didn't have a vote when the country decided in 2016 to leave the European Union. She's determined to have her say on Brexit now.\n\nAn election for the European Parliament being held this month in all 28 EU member states -- including the not-yet-departed U.K. -- is giving Hegtermans and other Europeans in Britain the chance to pass judgment on the Brexit decision that left their lives in limbo.\n\n\"It is a way for people to voice their frustration,\" said Hegtermans, a Dutch citizen and member of The 3 Million, a lobby group for EU citizens in Britain.\n\nLike other non-U.K. EU nationals, she was not eligible to vote in Britain's EU membership referendum three years ago -- and like them she saw her automatic right to live and work in Britain whipped away by the Brexit decision. (The British government says all 3 million EU citizens in Britain can stay, but they have to apply for \"settled status\" through a somewhat glitch-prone new registration process).\n\n\"We did not have a vote in the referendum, we could not voice anything while we were the people who will be affected the most,\" Hegtermans said.\n\nShe said the May 23 election to fill the U.K.'s 73 seats in the 751-seat EU legislature \"is one way for us to let our voices (be) heard.\"\n\nThe result of next week's election won't directly affect Brexit. But it will be interpreted as a test of public sentiment -- almost a mini-referendum -- and could sway politicians to take a harder or softer course as Britain heads for the exit door.\n\nThat makes this the most high-profile European election in Britain in years -- but it shouldn't be happening. The U.K. was due to have left the EU by now.\n\nInstead, British politicians are deadlocked over departure terms and Brexit has been postponed from March 29 until Oct. 31 while they try to sort out the mess. So Britain is taking part, and the contest here is dominated by candidates promising either to speed up Brexit or throw it into reverse gear.\n\nPro-European parties are eager to attract votes from EU citizens, who can vote in European polls though not in U.K. national elections.\n\nThat's why a former finance minister of Poland could be found recently standing outside a suburban London subway station, thrusting anti-Brexit leaflets at tired commuters. Jan Vincent-Rostowski, a London-born economist who served in a center-right Polish government between 2007 and 2013, is a candidate for the newly former pro-EU party Change UK.\n\n\"I thought that was something I could bring to the campaign, being both a British citizen -- a Londoner born and bred -- but also a Polish citizen who has done his bit in politics elsewhere,\" Vincent-Rostowski said.\n\n\"Brexit is collapsing under the weight of its own internal contradictions. And if something bad is collapsing I think it's a good idea to give it a push. That's what I'm trying to do.\"\n\nChipper and polite -- \"Can I give you a leaflet madam?\" -- he got a reasonably warm reception in suburban Ealing, a diverse London district that voted 60% for remaining in the European Union. Several Poles recognized him, stopping to chat or film him on their phones.\n\nBut this is a heated and bad-tempered election. Both of Britain's main parties -- the governing Conservative and opposition Labour -- are bracing for a hammering as voters frustrated by the Brexit impasse turn to parties promising either a definitive break with the EU or a chance to remain in the bloc.\n\nThousands of Brexiteers across the country are flocking to rallies for the new Brexit Party led by former U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, who accuses the government of betraying Brexit and wants Britain to walk away from the bloc even if there is no divorce deal to smooth the way.\n\nAmong pro-Europeans, Change UK is competing for votes with the centrist Liberal Democrats and environmentalist Greens. All support holding a new referendum that would include the option of remaining in the EU.\n\nPolitics professor Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London said EU citizens' votes could deliver a boost to pro-EU parties, if \"they can be bothered to come out and vote in what is such a depressing time for them. \"\n\nEU elections in Britain generally have a low turnout. At the last EU election in 2014, it was 35%, and Bale said a turnout of 40% this time would be \"stunning.\"\n\nEU citizens also must navigate a U.K. voter-registration process that requires them to fill out a form declaring that they do not plan to also vote in their home country.\n\nHegtermans said there has been \"quite a bit of confusion\" about the forms, and the deadline for registration passed on May 7. It's likely some Europeans will show up at polling stations only to be turned away.\n\nOthers may stay away out of a common U.K. malaise: Brexhaustion.\n\nEuropeans in London expressed a mix of enthusiasm and resignation at the prospect of an election that -- three years after the vote to leave the EU -- is dominated by Brexit.\n\n\"As a Polish citizen, I would love Britain to stay in the European Union,\" said 32-year-old Kate Staron. \"So definitely I will vote and try to make some difference. .. I encourage everyone else to go and vote as every vote is important.\"\n\nMarcel Wojtyniak, a 25-year-old data analyst also from Poland, wasn't so sure.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of exhaustion on the subject,\" he said.\n\n\"I suppose I just moved on. I accepted the fact. I don't really think the European elections are going to make that much difference.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Jill Lawless at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless\n\n___\n\nFor more news from The Associated Press on the European Parliament elections go to https://www.apnews.com/EuropeanParliament\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Northern Ireland's is even stricter.", "body": "By Karla Adam Karla Adam London correspondent covering the United Kingdom May 16 at 3:01 PM\n\nLONDON -- The passage of Alabama's strictest-in-the-nation abortion bill has renewed calls to overhaul Northern Ireland's abortion regulations, which are among the most restrictive in the developed world.\n\nUnder the Alabama abortion legislation, signed by Republican Gov. Kay Ivey on Wednesday, doctors who perform abortions could face up to 99 years or life in prison, but a pregnant woman would not face penalties.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, both women who have abortions and those who assist them can face up to life in prison.\n\n\"The law in Northern Ireland is considerably more restrictive than Alabama,\" said Fiona de Londras, a law professor at the University of Birmingham.\n\n\"This is not an instance where criminalization is just on the books. There have been charges,\" she added.\n\nIn one high-profile case currently in the courts, prosecutors in Northern Ireland brought charges against a mother who bought abortion pills online for her then 15-year-old daughter, who was in a physically and mentally abusive relationship. After the pregnancy was terminated, the mother shared the information with her doctor, who in turn referred her to the police. The mother has challenged the decision to prosecute her, and a judgement is expected imminently.\n\n[Alabama's new plan to ban abortion could jail doctors. In some countries, laws already do.]\n\nPro-choice campaigners here have pledged solidarity with their counterparts in the United States and are calling for the liberalization of British laws that date back to the 19th century.\n\nEmma Campbell, co-chair of Alliance for Choice, an abortion rights group in Northern Ireland, said that it's surprising to see people in Britain who are \"flabbergasted at what's happening in Alabama but have never mentioned Northern Ireland, which in effect has a worse law than what is being proposed in Alabama.\"\n\nHer organization wrote a letter of warning to activists in Alabama.\n\n\"You and the people you help might actually get arrested, you might have your homes searched and your workplaces raided. Maybe a GP will inform the police of your illegal behaviour, or a flatmate... either way you really have to know who you can trust with the information about your medical procedure, if you access pills at home because you cannot travel,\" the letter said.\n\nStella Creasy, a Labour lawmaker, said that those in Britain outraged at Alabama should also look to their own backyard.\n\nShe tweeted: \"Hey uk progressive gents -- women in Northern Ireland AS WELL as doctors facing life imprisonment in the UK for an abortion. [Alabama] terrible and our own country reprimanded by the UN for our own human rights abuses. Speak out at home as well as against trump & co.\"\n\nCreasy successfully campaigned for Northern Irish women who travel to other parts of the United Kingdom to have access to funded terminations. Before that change in 2017, a Northern Irish woman who had made her way to England was charged about $1,150 for the procedure.\n\n[How an Irish-American woman's legal case helped spur Ireland's abortion referendum]\n\nSince the Abortion Act of 1967, abortion in Britain has been legal in most circumstances up to 24 weeks, as long as it's signed off by two doctors. That law applies to England, Scotland and Wales, but it does not extend to Northern Ireland, where the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861 still prevails.\n\nPolling by YouGov, conducted shortly after the Republic of Ireland overturned its abortion ban last year, found that 65 percent of people in Northern Ireland say abortion should not be a crime. Support for a right to choose an abortion rises further when a woman's health, rape, incest or fatal fetal abnormality are at issue.\n\nBut those who want to change the law in Northern Ireland have run into multiple obstacles.\n\nThe devolved, power-sharing government that is supposed to lead Northern Ireland fell apart more than two years ago and has not been active since.\n\nIn its absence, the Conservative government in Westminster has rebuffed efforts by lawmakers to repeal sections of the 1861 act, which would decriminalize abortion across the U.K. The Conservatives, who argue that the issue is one for Northern Ireland to decide, are propped up in government by Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which opposes changing the abortion law.\n\nGrainne Teggart, Amnesty UK's Northern Ireland campaign manager, said her group was \"horrified by what we are seeing in the U.S., which is a terrifying roll-back on reproductive rights.\" But she said that the United Kingdom was \"no better\" and called on the British government to \"lead on this issue, not lag behind.\"\n\nRead more\n\n'Derry tonight.

Yet, in Parliament, the math does not appear to have changed for Mrs. May \u2014 at least not for the better.\n\nHer Conservatives are braced for a humiliating defeat in European elections this week, confronted by the challenge of the Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage, who wants Britain to leave the European Union fast, without any deal if necessary.\n\nSeveral of those vying to succeed Mrs. May are already arguing the same hard Brexit line. As a result, several hard-line pro-Brexit supporters within Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party, who reluctantly supported the last of her three efforts to get the plan through Parliament, are indicating they will revert to their earlier hostility.\n\nMark Francois, a prominent member of the hard-line Brexit faction told the BBC that the opposition to Mrs. May\u2019s deal was \u201cgoing up, not down.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless she is rescued by a Marxist,\u201d said Mr. Francois, referring to Mr. Corbyn, \u201cthe Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead on arrival.\u201d", "date": "2019-05-21", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/world/europe/theresa-may-referendum-brexit.html", "title": "Theresa May\u2019s New Brexit Bid: A Second Referendum", "authors": [], "dataType": "news", "dateTime": null, "eventUri": null, "image": null, "idDuplicate": false, "lang": "eng", "sentiment": null, "sim": null, "source": null, "time": null, "uri": null, "wgt": null}, {"body": "Mrs. May is leaving Downing Street, but not today.\n\nFacing a cabinet rebellion, Theresa May set out Friday morning a timetable for her departure from office.\n\nStanding in front of 10 Downing Street, Mrs. May said it was in the \u201cbest interests of the country for a new prime minister\u201d to lead Britain through the Brexit process. She announced plans to step down as the leader of the Conservative Party on June 7, with the process to replace her beginning the following week. She will remain as a lame-duck prime minister until a new leader is chosen, probably by the end of July.\n\n\u201cI feel as certain today as I did three years ago that in a democracy, if you give people a choice you have a duty to implement what they decide. I have done my best to do that,\u201d she added. \u201cI have done everything I can to convince M.P.s to back that deal. Sadly, I have not been able to do so.\u201d\n\nMrs. May\u2019s voice cracked as she said she was honored to serve the country as the \u201csecond female prime minister, but certainly not the last,\u201d and said the role had been the honor of her life.\n\nThe speech followed a meeting with Graham Brady, a powerful leader of backbench Conservative lawmakers.\n\nShe will continue as a member of Parliament after stepping down as prime minister, the Press Association news agency has reported.\n\nIn Brussels, the Brexit equation is unchanged.\n\nEuropean Union officials worry about what comes next, but they insisted that their position on Brexit would not budge. The bloc\u2019s leaders did not want Britain to leave, but they remain committed to the withdrawal agreement Mrs. May negotiated, even if the next prime minister is a hard-line Brexiteer who tries to drive a harder bargain.\n\n\u201cWe are ready, we have been ready, we continue to be ready whatever the scenario is,\u201d said Mina Andreeva, a European Commission spokeswoman. But, she added, the commission would prefer \u201can orderly withdrawal on the basis of the withdrawal agreement that has been negotiated with the U.K.\u201d\n\nThe view from Brussels is that the choices remain the negotiated deal, an economically damaging \u201ccliff edge\u201d Brexit without a deal, or no Brexit at all.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Spanish government called Mrs. May\u2019s resignation \u201cbad news\u201d because it makes a no-deal Brexit more likely.\n\nIn Paris, the German ambassador to France, Nikolaus Meyer-Landrut, speaking at an event hosted by the American University of Paris, noted the resignation of Mrs. May and said that Germany was always willing to give the British more time to sort out the Brexit impasse.\n\nBut even with Mrs. May\u2019s resignation, he said, Brexit and its dilemmas remained. \u201cBrexit yes or no,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBut more important is, Brexit how? Every how has a price. And the British begin to understand how high is the price.\u201d\nSign up for The Interpreter\nSubscribe for original insights, commentary and discussions on the major news stories of the week, from columnists Max Fisher and Amanda Taub.\n\nThe succession race is well underway.\n\nConservative lawmakers have been positioning themselves for a leadership contest for months. Several were already campaigning actively before Mrs. May announced her decision to resign.\n\nCandidates for party leadership have to be nominated by two other members of Parliament, though if there is only one candidate, he or she automatically becomes the new leader. If more than two candidates emerge, lawmakers vote among themselves to narrow the field and then put two candidates to a vote by all Conservative Party members, who number approximately 120,000.\n\nThe Conservative Party chairman, Brandon Lewis, said in a statement on Friday that lawmakers would begin their voting process on June 10, and that the new leader would be in place before Parliament\u2019s summer break, which usually begins in late July.\n\nHard-line Brexit supporters will be determined to replace Mrs. May with someone from their ranks. The former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson; the former Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab; and Andrea Leadsom, who left her cabinet post as leader of the House of Commons on Wednesday, are seen as likely contenders.\n\nBut less ideological figures are likely to put themselves forward, too, including Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, and Sajid Javid, the home secretary.\n\nThe departure process starts after Trump\u2019s June visit ends.\n\nConservative lawmakers have been deeply frustrated by Mrs. May\u2019s failure to deliver on Brexit, which became the government\u2019s central \u2014 some would say its sole \u2014 preoccupation after the country voted to leave the union in a 2016 referendum.\n\nBut the breaking point has come at an awkward moment, with President Trump scheduled to arrive in Britain on June 3 for a state visit and to take part in events to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings that preceded the end of World War II.\n\nMr. Trump and Mrs. May are to meet at 10 Downing Street on June 4, according to a schedule released by Buckingham Palace. Mr. Trump is also to attend a state banquet at Buckingham Palace, hosted by the queen.\n\nMrs. May\u2019s ability to soak up political punishment and plow on regardless won her admiration, even from some of her many critics. But the pressure on her increased after disastrous local election results this month, when the Conservatives lost more than 1,300 seats in municipalities around the country.\n\nThen, the government announced that Britain would, after all, take part in elections to the European Parliament this week \u2014 another symbol of Mrs. May\u2019s failure to achieve a withdrawal. Britons voted on Thursday, but the results will be announced on Sunday, after all the European Union countries have gone to the polls. They are expected to be catastrophic for the Conservatives.\n\nMrs. May\u2019s speech upset immigration advocates and firefighters.\n\nEven in her departure speech, Mrs. May drew ire from some in the country who saw her language as insulting.\n\nFirst, she quoted Sir Nicholas Winton, who orchestrated the rescue of hundreds of children from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in an effort known as Kindertransport, and was a constituent of hers in the final years of his life.\n\nShe recalled that he had pulled her aside at a local event and extolled the value of compromise, advice she said she worried lawmakers had forgotten. Some analysts hailed the line as a powerful, if belated, pitch for an elusive compromise.\n\nBut immigration advocates saw that as a shameless attempt to use Mr. Winton\u2019s legacy by a prime minister who had made anti-migrant policies a centerpiece of her political career.\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\n\u201cTheresa May did everything in her power to keep vulnerable refugees out of the U.K. and introduced the hostile environment. Makes me livid,\u201d Colin Yeo, an immigration lawyer, wrote on Twitter.\n\nMrs. May was previously Britain\u2019s home secretary, and implemented a \u201chostile environment\u201d policy that obliged businesses and private landlords, as well as public officials, to check the immigration papers of job applicants, renters, medical patients, banking customers and more. It gave rise to the Windrush scandal, in which people from Caribbean countries were wrongly denied rights or deported from Britain.\n\nThen, Mrs. May pointed to her government\u2019s response to the Grenfell fire disaster that left some 72 people dead as a proud part of her legacy. The Fire Brigades Union issued a statement that called Mrs. May\u2019s comment \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of the underlying issues at Grenfell were due to unsafe conditions that had been allowed to fester under Tory governments and a council for which Theresa May bears ultimate responsibility,\u201d the statement read.\n\nBritish business is preparing for more uncertainty.\n\nBritain has taken several economic hits recently, and business leaders are worried about the prospect of more gridlock in Parliament, potentially leading to a harmful \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cThere are only five months before Britain crashes out of the E.U. without a deal, causing prices to rise and reducing the availability of many goods on the shelves,\u201d Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said in a statement.\n\nDespite such concerns, British stocks rose slightly on Thursday.\n\nA number of businesses, wary of Brexit and the uncertainty surrounding it, have already moved some operations out of Britain.\n\nBritish Steel, the country\u2019s second-biggest steel company, collapsed into insolvency this week and said Brexit was partly to blame. The travel company Thomas Cook reported massive losses, saying Brexit had held travelers back from booking trips.\n\nFor months, retailers stockpiled goods ahead of previous Brexit deadlines for fear that traffic jams and issues at the border would prevent food from getting into the country. Britain imports about half its food from or via the European Union.\n\nMrs. May\u2019s fall echoed another leader\u2019s, complete with sexist overtones.\n\nThroughout Mrs. May\u2019s protracted fall, Conservative lawmakers were eager to avoid being seen as the proverbial \u201cmen in gray suits\u201d ushering out Britain\u2019s second female prime minister, even as they worked hard behind the scenes to do just that.\n\nThe party suffered after being seen to humiliate Margaret Thatcher, Britain\u2019s first female prime minister, when she was forced out in 1990. But in the days before Mrs. May announced her resignation plans, the echoes were hard to avoid.\n\nLawmakers raised the prospect of Mrs. May\u2019s husband, Philip, intervening, much as Ms. Thatcher\u2019s husband, Denis, was famously said to have urged her to stand down.\n\nIain Duncan Smith, a prominent Brexiteer and former Conservative party leader, said in a radio interview about Mrs. May: \u201cThe only person closest to her is clearly her husband, and I think somebody has to say, \u2018Look, nobody likes this.\u2019\u201d\n\nA British tabloid, Metro, played up those appeals with the headline, \u201cJust Tell Her Phil.\u201d\n\nTributes flowed from those who tried to oust her.  \n\nIt has been a long time since so many prominent political figures had nice things to say about Mrs. May.\n\nCompliments poured in from opposition lawmakers who have tried to oust her, and from fellow Conservatives who have undermined her and hope to take her place. Some were backhanded, some barbed, and still others gave no hint of the history of animosity behind them.\n\n\u201cThank you for your stoical service to our country and the Conservative Party,\u201d tweeted Mr. Johnson, who quit Mrs. May\u2019s cabinet over Brexit and who has never concealed his ambition to be prime minister.\n\nNicola Sturgeon, first minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party, retweeted Mr. Johnson with the comment, \u201cWhat a hypocrite.\u201d\n\nTwo other Conservatives who quit Mrs. May\u2019s cabinet over Brexit and would like to take her place, Mr. Raab and Ms. Leadsom, described her statement as \u201cdignified.\u201d\n\nThe statement from Tom Watson, deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party, was no bouquet, saying that Mrs. May \u201chad an unenviably difficult job, and she did it badly.\u201d But even he added, \u201cshe tried to do what was right for our country,\u201d and was \u201chonorable in her intentions.\u201d\n\nJeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, dispensed with any pretense of a tribute. \u201cShe\u2019s now accepted what the country\u2019s known for months: She can\u2019t govern, and nor can her divided and disintegrating party.\u201d\n\nBut few politicians could put themselves in her place as completely as her immediate predecessor, David Cameron, whose own six-year premiership was torpedoed three years ago \u2014 also by Brexit.\n\n\u201cI know what it feels like when you come to realize your leadership time has finished, that the country needs a new leader, and it\u2019s extremely difficult and painful to step outside Downing Street and say those things,\u201d he told reporters on Friday, standing on a picturesque country road, amid waving grasses.\n\nOne could also argue that Mr. Cameron left the problem in her lap: He is the one who promised to hold the Brexit referendum, a monumental gamble he made to placate the Euroskeptic wing of his party.\n", "date": "2019-05-24", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/world/europe/theresa-may-resignation.html", "title": "Theresa May to Resign as U.K. Prime Minister", "authors": [], "dataType": "news", "dateTime": null, "eventUri": null, "image": null, "idDuplicate": false, "lang": "eng", "sentiment": null, "sim": null, "source": null, "time": null, "uri": null, "wgt": null}, {"uri": "1144055368", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "23:36:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T23:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/yes-europes-far-right-is-gaining-strength-but-so-is-the-resistance/2019/05/23/d185105a-7d85-11e9-8bb7-0fc796cf2ec0_story.html", "title": "Opinion | Yes, Europe's far right is gaining strength. But so is the resistance.", "body": "By Anne Applebaum Anne Applebaum Columnist focusing on national politics and foreign policy Columnist May 23 at 6:49 PM\n\nI've written a lot, it's true, about the new far-right parties in Europe in recent months, including their use of the Internet to amplify anger, the conspiracy theories they rely upon and their Russian connections -- all of which helps to explain why they may score a big victory in this week's European parliamentary elections. But it's worth remembering that there is another side to this story. The politics of President Trump and Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, and the disaster of Brexit, have also produced a backlash: Pro-European politicians, highly conscious of past mistakes, are also gaining in strength. And they are thinking hard about what to do next.\n\nOn Tuesday, I met one of the leaders of this backlash: Emmanuel Macron, who himself founded an anti-establishment movement on his way to becoming president of France. The occasion was a lunch, organized by French philosopher Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy, for a group of European writers, historians and philosophers. This was a private lunch, not an interview, so I won't quote anyone directly. But the conversation followed a pattern now familiar from Macron's extensive public meetings.\n\nNotably, the French president lets everyone talk. He listens. He takes notes. He nods to his aides when he hears something he thinks especially important, so that they take notes, too. And what seemed to interest him most was the anxiety he heard -- about Europe, about the return of familiar kinds of xenophobia, about democracy itself. In response, he offered some context, pointing out that the fears of intellectuals are not necessarily shared by voters, and that the failures of economic liberalism have now helped to discredit political liberalism, too.\n\nHe also pointed out, as he has done elsewhere, that those who fear the return of nationalism and nativism across the continent still don't have a common political language. They are the majority -- in most countries, the vast majority. But they are also center-right conservatives, center-left social democrats and liberals from many countries, and they don't necessarily use the same political vocabulary. They lack a common set of heroes, a common set of themes -- in other words, to use the now unavoidable phrase, they lack a common narrative. Inexcusably, they have in some cases let people like Heinz-Christian Strache, the Austrian far-right leader who resigned after he was caught on video offering contracts and business favors to a woman he thought was a wealthy Russian, claim to speak for \"patriotism\" and \"European civilization,\" when in reality they stand for corruption and an end to political debate.\n\nThe only real solutions to this problem are long-term. In the past, Macron has talked of creating networks of European universities, schools and cultural institutions to ensure that \"every European recognizes their destiny in the figures adorning a Greek temple or in Mona Lisa's smile,\" as well as similar networks of European police forces and militaries to keep Europeans safe in an era of radical Islamist terrorism, Russian espionage and U.S. disinterest. He has also talked of ecology and prosperity as goals that, in a world increasingly dominated by superpowers, can only be pursued if European states work together.\n\nSome of these ideas are already resonating. Across the continent, a number of parties have won new voters by making ecological arguments. In Germany and Austria, the fortunes of Green parties are rising; in Britain's very weird European parliamentary elections -- thrown together in haste, since Britain was meant to be out of the European Union by now -- the Green party is also projected to reach high levels of support, as are the Liberal Democrats, a pro-European party that was nearly wiped out in the last general election. In Spain and the Netherlands, voters are moving back to center-left parties, precisely because they offer pro-European platforms.\n\nThis is not accidental: Pragmatic actions designed to increase European security -- for example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's deal to keep Syrian refugees in Turkey -- have left a mark. Despite the far-right's heavy investment in automated messaging and partisan social media -- thanks to which they dominate the Twitter debate in many countries -- polls show that most Europeans do not consider \"migration\" to be the main issue in these elections. The chaos of Brexit has also had an impact. Far from dropping, the popularity of the European Union is rising, and a number of far-right parties have hastily rolled back their anti-European rhetoric as a result. The far-right Sweden Democrats have dropped all talk of \"Swexit,\" and France's Marine Le Pen shuns any mention of \"Frexit.\" Across central Europe, it has been highly amusing to watch anti-European parties scramble to wrap themselves in blue European flags during this election campaign, once they realized that majorities of voters -- 91 percent in Poland, for example -- want to stay in Europe, not leave.\n\nThe question, of course, is how fast this reconstruction of European politics around common, positive themes can happen. There are a lot of obstacles in the way: the Kremlin, Islamist militants and a part of the Trump administration are all pushing for the re-division of Europe, in their different ways. Macron himself may not be reelected. A new \"hard Brexit\" prime minister in Britain may well precipitate a crisis. Still, the seeds of what could be a European revival, around new issues, with more pragmatism and less arrogance, are also visible this week. When you read over the next few days about the gains of the far right, remember that their new opponents are part of the story, too.\n\nRead more from Anne Applebaum's archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.\n\nChristian Caryl: Europe is sending us a warning for 2020.

Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday clung to power, going so far as to discuss whether reneging on a new Brexit deal she rolled out two days earlier could mollify cabinet ministers eager to replace her.\n\nHer hopes of trying once more to push her Brexit deal through Parliament were dashed after changes she unveiled to much fanfare on Tuesday -- including opening the door to a second referendum on Brexit -- were rejected by Brexiteers as a betrayal and by Remainers as insufficient. Plans to publish her new plan on Friday were shelved.\n\nBut Mrs. May's undoing seemed more a matter of timing and choreography than anything else. She will meet on Friday with Graham Brady, who leads the committee of Mrs. May's Conservative backbench lawmakers. He is holding onto secret ballots from some of those lawmakers that could allow the party to change its rules and try to unseat Mrs. May almost immediately.\n\nBut the principal focus on Thursday was the European elections, the results of which will not be known until Sunday. They are being seen as a referendum on the main parties' handling of Brexit, and most polls show a humiliating loss for both the Conservatives and Labour.\n\nThe Brexit issue has long paralyzed the main parties, whose ranks contain factions from both sides of the debate and which are constantly splitting the difference, pleasing nobody. As a result, increasingly polarized voters are searching for parties that promote their side unabashedly: the Brexit Party for Leavers and the Liberal Democrats for Remainers who want a second referendum.\n\nAnd the European elections, typically low-turnout affairs dominated by the most ideologically motivated voters, provided an excellent opportunity for voters to flock to those parties to cast a protest vote that reflects their frustrations with the major parties.\n\n\"I'm gutted about Brexit,\" said Stephen Page, 65, a retired London taxi driver and print worker as he leaned on a railing outside a polling station in Barking, a suburban town about 45 minutes east of central London. \"I've literally voted Lib Dem because Corbyn wouldn't, what we call, nail his flag to the mast. He's dithered.\"\n\nHe was talking about the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has for months walked a tightrope on Brexit, refusing to commit to backing either a second referendum in all cases or a compromise Brexit deal with Mrs. May.\n\nMr. Page said he had watched his town change considerably in the past few decades, with the white British population dropping to 50 percent in 2011 from 80 percent a decade earlier in the borough of Barking and Dagenham. During the same period, many immigrants arrived from Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe borough, traditionally a Labour stronghold, elected some far-right councilors from the British National Party in the mid-2000s, and 62 percent voted in 2016 to leave the European Union.\n\nOutside a church preschool serving as a polling station in Dagenham, Olivia Walugembe, 37, a nurse and a refugee from Uganda, said the events of the past three years had awakened immigrants in the town who had ignored Brexit before the 2016 referendum. She said they were especially scared of an end to free movement, the right of European Union citizens to live and work across the bloc.\n\n\"Most black foreigners didn't think it would affect them,\" she said. \"They thought it's only to do with immigration coming from Europe. Now, people have realized it's going to put a stop to so many things, even just free movement, so they've changed their minds.\"\n\nShe said she had voted for Labour because she had detected the party moving toward backing a second referendum.\n\nBut Ms. Walugembe was a rare voter sticking with a mainstream party. In several hours of interviews outside two polling stations, the only man who admitted voting for Mrs. May's Conservative Party hustled away without wanting to explain why.\n\nInstead, most anti-Europeans had cast their lot with the Brexit Party, which has not articulated any policies beyond Brexit and has become a vehicle for Nigel Farage, the populist who played a big role in the Leave campaign in 2016 and is back to rally them again. The party has come under criticism for its finances, but voters were unconcerned.\n\n\"He seems to be the voice of the people,\" said Paul Yetton, 62, after voting. \"I don't trust any of the rest of them. I think they're all the same.\"\n\nIn Dagenham, Gary McCarthy, 59, a school caretaker who supported Mrs. May in elections two years ago, said that he voted for the Brexit Party and might not return to the Tory fold even if the party kicked out Mrs. May and chose a Brexiteer like the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, as leader.\n\n\"He's still establishment,\" Mr. McCarthy said. \"Somewhere in politics we need a change.\"\n\n\"We need Trump, that's who we need,\" his wife, Carmel McCarthy, 60, interjected. \"At least he's not afraid to say what he thinks.\"\n\nReports piled up throughout the day of European Union citizens living in Britain being turned away from polling stations, despite being registered to vote. Advocates for those citizens said administrative errors by local councils and widespread confusion about the registration process had led to many people being denied the right to vote.\n\nSome people complained they had been sent the wrong forms needed by European Union citizens to vote outside their home country, or received them too late.\n\n\"I didn't receive my form in the mail, but when I called the council yesterday, they said I was eligible,\" Solange Martin, a French student living in London, said. \"But today when I went to vote, they abruptly said no.\"\n\nThe Electoral Commission in Britain said the government's late decision to participate in the election limited the time available for European Union citizens to complete their registration.\n\nDespite the seismic changes in British politics, voters were unsentimental about spurning their usual parties. Janice Melis, 75, a lifelong Labour supporter, was voting for the Liberal Democrats because she said she wanted a second referendum and Mr. Corbyn \"does nothing.\"\n\n\"I've been a socialist all my life,\" Ms. Melis said, a young girl tugging on her arm, \"but I'm not voting for them today. I'm fed up with it all.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_mueller@nytimes.com", "name": "Benjamin Mueller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/23/world/23brexit/23brexit-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 296344320}, {"uri": "1143908311", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "19:17:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T19:17:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/learning/over-140-picture-prompts-to-inspire-student-writing.html", "title": "Over 140 Picture Prompts to Inspire Student Writing", "body": "Think The New York Times is only for readers at a high-school reading level?

Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday clung to power, going so far as to discuss whether reneging on a new Brexit deal she rolled out two days earlier could mollify cabinet ministers eager to replace her.\n\nHer hopes of trying once more to push her Brexit deal through Parliament were dashed after changes she unveiled to much fanfare on Tuesday -- including opening the door to a second referendum on Brexit -- were rejected by Brexiteers as a betrayal and by Remainers as insufficient. Plans to publish her new plan on Friday were shelved.\n\nBut Mrs. May's undoing seemed more a matter of timing and choreography than anything else. She will meet on Friday with Graham Brady, who leads the committee of Mrs. May's Conservative backbench lawmakers. He is holding onto secret ballots from some of those lawmakers that could allow the party to change its rules and try to unseat Mrs. May almost immediately.\n\nBut the principal focus on Thursday was the European elections, the results of which will not be known until Sunday. They are being seen as a referendum on the main parties' handling of Brexit, and most polls show a humiliating loss for both the Conservatives and Labour.\n\nThe Brexit issue has long paralyzed the main parties, whose ranks contain factions from both sides of the debate and which are constantly splitting the difference, pleasing nobody. As a result, increasingly polarized voters are searching for parties that promote their side unabashedly: the Brexit Party for Leavers and the Liberal Democrats for Remainers who want a second referendum.\n\nAnd the European elections, typically low-turnout affairs dominated by the most ideologically motivated voters, provided an excellent opportunity for voters to flock to those parties to cast a protest vote that reflects their frustrations with the major parties.\n\n\"I'm gutted about Brexit,\" said Stephen Page, 65, a retired London taxi driver and print worker as he leaned on a railing outside a polling station in Barking, a suburban town about 45 minutes east of central London. \"I've literally voted Lib Dem because Corbyn wouldn't, what we call, nail his flag to the mast. He's dithered.\"\n\nHe was talking about the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has for months walked a tightrope on Brexit, refusing to commit to backing either a second referendum in all cases or a compromise Brexit deal with Mrs. May.\n\nMr. Page said he had watched his town change considerably in the past few decades, with the white British population dropping to 50 percent in 2011 from 80 percent a decade earlier in the borough of Barking and Dagenham. During the same period, many immigrants arrived from Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe borough, traditionally a Labour stronghold, elected some far-right councilors from the British National Party in the mid-2000s, and 62 percent voted in 2016 to leave the European Union.\n\nOutside a church preschool serving as a polling station in Dagenham, Olivia Walugembe, 37, a nurse and a refugee from Uganda, said the events of the past three years had awakened immigrants in the town who had ignored Brexit before the 2016 referendum. She said they were especially scared of an end to free movement, the right of European Union citizens to live and work across the bloc.\n\n\"Most black foreigners didn't think it would affect them,\" she said. \"They thought it's only to do with immigration coming from Europe. Now, people have realized it's going to put a stop to so many things, even just free movement, so they've changed their minds.\"\n\nShe said she had voted for Labour because she had detected the party moving toward backing a second referendum.\n\nBut Ms. Walugembe was a rare voter sticking with a mainstream party. In several hours of interviews outside two polling stations, the only man who admitted voting for Mrs. May's Conservative Party hustled away without wanting to explain why.\n\nInstead, most anti-Europeans had cast their lot with the Brexit Party, which has not articulated any policies beyond Brexit and has become a vehicle for Nigel Farage, the populist who played a big role in the Leave campaign in 2016 and is back to rally them again. The party has come under criticism for its finances, but voters were unconcerned.\n\n\"He seems to be the voice of the people,\" said Paul Yetton, 62, after voting. \"I don't trust any of the rest of them. I think they're all the same.\"\n\nIn Dagenham, Gary McCarthy, 59, a school caretaker who supported Mrs. May in elections two years ago, said that he voted for the Brexit Party and might not return to the Tory fold even if the party kicked out Mrs. May and chose a Brexiteer like the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, as leader.\n\n\"He's still establishment,\" Mr. McCarthy said. \"Somewhere in politics we need a change.\"\n\n\"We need Trump, that's who we need,\" his wife, Carmel McCarthy, 60, interjected. \"At least he's not afraid to say what he thinks.\"\n\nReports piled up throughout the day of European Union citizens living in Britain being turned away from polling stations, despite being registered to vote. Advocates for those citizens said administrative errors by local councils and widespread confusion about the registration process had led to many people being denied the right to vote.\n\nSome people complained they had been sent the wrong forms needed by European Union citizens to vote outside their home country, or received them too late.\n\n\"I didn't receive my form in the mail, but when I called the council yesterday, they said I was eligible,\" Solange Martin, a French student living in London, said. \"But today when I went to vote, they abruptly said no.\"\n\nThe Electoral Commission in Britain said the government's late decision to participate in the election limited the time available for European Union citizens to complete their registration.\n\nDespite the seismic changes in British politics, voters were unsentimental about spurning their usual parties. Janice Melis, 75, a lifelong Labour supporter, was voting for the Liberal Democrats because she said she wanted a second referendum and Mr. Corbyn \"does nothing.\"\n\n\"I've been a socialist all my life,\" Ms. Melis said, a young girl tugging on her arm, \"but I'm not voting for them today. I'm fed up with it all.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_mueller@nytimes.com", "name": "Benjamin Mueller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/23/world/23brexit/23brexit-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4803960", "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 296335020}, {"uri": "1143884499", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "18:53:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T18:53:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/books/review/8-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html", "title": "8 New Books We Recommend This Week", "body": "Those who forget history are ... in luck, actually. This week's recommended reading includes refreshers on everything from the settling of Polynesia to Brooklyn's past as a queer enclave to the impeachment of Andrew Johnson in 1868. There's art history, in Mar\u00eda Gainza's autofiction about an Argentine critic; and literary history, in Casey Cep's riveting account of the true-crime story that Harper Lee was never able to write; a fictional look back at Palestine in the early 1900s; and a nonfiction analysis of European history from 1950 until the age of Brexit. It's a list that might appeal to the heroine of Binnie Kirshenbaum's novel \"Rabbits for Food,\" were she not sidelined by a crippling depression: \"Bunny's range of interests,\" Kirshenbaum writes early in the book, is \"varied: history, politics, antiques, animal rights, psychology, fashion, and literature, serious literature, although now she is interested in nothing.\" This novel isn't about history per se, but that line -- with its hint that we live at the edge of nihilism, and that all of our distractions are just so much scaffolding against the void -- surely gets at one of history's recurring themes, and one of the reasons we turn to it in the first place for edification and consolation: because we have survived so much (history tells us), and here we are.\n\nGregory Cowles\n\nSenior Editor, Books\n\nTwitter: @GregoryCowles\n\nTHE IMPEACHERS: The Trial of Andrew Johnson and the Dream of a Just Nation, by Brenda Wineapple. (Random House, $32.) The latest from the award-winning Wineapple is about the first impeachment trial in the United States, in 1868, when Andrew Johnson, who ascended to the presidency after Abraham Lincoln's assassination, was nearly voted out of office. (The House overwhelmingly gave him the boot; the Senate saved him.) Wineapple started to research this book six years ago; she briefly mentions Presidents Nixon and Clinton but not the current occupant of the White House. \"She doesn't have to,\" our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. \"The relevance of this riveting and absorbing book is clear enough, even if Wineapple's approach is too literary and incisive to offer anything so obvious as a lesson.\"\n\nFURIOUS HOURS: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee, by Casey Cep. (Knopf, $26.95.) Cep's remarkable first book is really two: a gripping investigation of a rural Alabama preacher who murdered five family members for the insurance in the 1970s, and a sensitive portrait of the novelist Harper Lee, who tried and failed to write her own book about the case. \"It takes Cep about five pages to eliminate from the reader's mind the possibility that the source of Harper Lee's literary problems was lack of material,\" Michael Lewis writes in his review. \"This story is just too good.\" In Cep's probing of \"another writer's failure to write,\" he adds, \"her book makes a magical little leap, and it goes from being a superbly written true-crime story to the sort of story that even Lee would have been proud to write.\"\n\nSEA PEOPLE: The Puzzle of Polynesia, by Christina Thompson. (Harper/HarperCollins, $29.99.) Mystery has long attended the inhabitants of the Pacific's far-flung islands: Where did they come from, when did they get there, and how? Thompson explores these questions, with a particular focus on the early Polynesians' incredible navigational skills, and \"succeeds admirably,\" Simon Winchester writes in his review. The book, he says, makes a \"fascinating and satisfying addition to an already considerable body of Polynesian literature.\"\n\nWHEN BROOKLYN WAS QUEER, by Hugh Ryan. (St. Martin's, $29.99.) This boisterous history captures the variety and creativity of the sexual outsiders who congregated around the economic hub of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a flourishing center of gay life from the middle of the 19th century until well into the 20th. Caleb Crain's review calls it \"an entertaining and insightful chronicle ... enhanced by original research in newspaper archives, unpublished letters and collections of ephemera.\"\n\nTHE GLOBAL AGE: Europe 1950-2017, by Ian Kershaw. (Viking, $40.) At a time of uncertainty and harsh political division, Kershaw's book offers valuable evidence that Europe's recent history was a period of enormous accomplishment, both politically and economically, achieved against obstacles that make many of today's troubles seem minor by comparison. \"Kershaw reminds us that the Continent has faced other large challenges in the postwar era and survived,\" Michael A. McFaul writes in his review; \"that some long-term trends of peace, prosperity and democracy are both robust and remarkable; and that individuals have agency, and can alter the course of events -- they are not mere expressions of those events.\"\n\nTHE PARISIAN, by Isabella Hammad. (Grove, $27.) This strikingly accomplished first novel, set in the early 20th century and modeled in part on the life of the author's grandfather, captures the fate of a European-educated Arab, a man divided, like his native Palestine. Our reviewer, Christopher Benfey, calls it \"a deeply imagined historical novel with none of the usual cobwebs of the genre,\" and says that the book has \"an up-close immediacy and stylistic panache ... all the more impressive coming from a London-born writer still in her 20s.\"\n\nRABBITS FOR FOOD, by Binnie Kirshenbaum. (Soho, $26.) After a New Year's breakdown, the heroine of this furious comic novel checks into a Manhattan mental hospital and starts taking notes. \"Kirshenbaum doesn't trivialize mental breakdown. She makes Bunny's debilitation raw and worrying, and not without its insights,\" Lucy Ellmann writes in her review. \"Being incarcerated paradoxically forces Bunny to reconnect with other people and her own mind. She's alert to the sanity of the insane, and the ineptitude of most of the staff.\" A bracing humor balances the despair.\n\nOPTIC NERVE, by Mar\u00eda Gainza. Translated by Thomas Bunstead. (Catapult, $25.) In this delightful autofiction -- the first book by Gainza, an Argentine art critic, to appear in English -- a woman delivers pithy assessments of world-class painters along with glimpses of her life, braiding the two into an illuminating whole. \"Mar\u00eda's store of information about painters and their lives can make reading the book feel, delightfully, like auditing a course,\" John Williams writes in his review. The book, he adds, \"consistently charms with its tight swirl of art history, personal reminiscence and aesthetic theories.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/23/books/23edchoice-covers/23edchoice-covers-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 296333580}, {"uri": "1143814476", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "17:09:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T17:09:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/amid-calls-for-theresa-may-to-resign-her-party-is-expected-to-flounder-in-european-elections/2019/05/23/bb0d6040-7ca7-11e9-b1f3-b233fe5811ef_story.html", "title": "Amid calls for Theresa May to resign, her party is expected to flounder in European elections", "body": "Prime Minister Theresa May and her husband, Phillip, cast their votes for the European Parliament in her Maidenhead constituency. (Neil Hall/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock) By Karla Adam and Karla Adam London correspondent covering the United Kingdom William Booth William Booth London bureau chief May 23 at 11:59 AM\n\nLONDON -- Britain went to the polls on Thursday for a bizarre election in which the party likely to win the most seats is one that would prefer not to be running at all.\n\nThree years after Britain voted to leave the European Union, and two months after it was supposed to leave, it is participating in elections for the European Parliament, the E.U.'s legislative body. If the polls are correct, arch-euroskeptic Nigel Farage's newly formed Brexit Party is on course to blow the competition out of the water.\n\nVoting is staggered across the continent through Sunday, with results starting to trickle in Sunday night.\n\nIn Europe, all eyes are on whether the populist, nationalist parties do well -- or whether the center holds.\n\nIn Britain, the vote is taking place amid growing speculation about when -- not if -- Prime Minister Theresa May will resign, with some commentators wondering if she can cling to power until the first week of June, when President Trump is due for state visit, including a banquet with Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nEither way, May's fortunes will not be aided by the drubbing her Conservative Party is expected to receive at the ballot box.\n\n\"I'm ashamed to admit I voted for the Brexit Party,\" said Bruce Horton-Gabell, a 41-year-old lawyer, after exiting a polling station in southwest London on Thursday morning.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage leaves a polling station in Biggin Hill, England. (Hannah Mckay/Reuters)\n\nHe said voted to \"remain\" in the 2016 Brexit referendum and is normally a centrist voter -- he once backed Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair and admired former U.S. president Barack Obama. But Horton-Gabell said a \"lack of leadership\" from Britain's two main parties on Brexit deterred him from voting for them.\n\n\"I was devastated when we voted to leave the E.U., but, as somebody who does believe in democracy and believes in what this country can achieve, I felt it was important that we made the most of it and got on with it,\" he said.\n\nThis election also could see pro-Brexit and pro-European forces doing well in Britain. But the pro-European voices are scattered across several parties, including the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party and a new group called Change UK.\n\nA recent YouGov poll had the Brexit Party at 37 percent, Liberal Democrats at 19, Labour at 13, Green at 12 and Conservatives at 7 percent. One of the striking things about the polls is how Britain's two main parties -- Labour and the Conservatives -- are barely in contention.\n\nAnti-establishment parties tend do well in these low-turnout elections that take place every five years. Last time, in 2014, Labour and the Conservatives came in a few points behind the euroskeptic party Farage was then leading. But this time polls have Farage's party beating their combined total.\n\nAnti-Brexit signs rest against a car in London on Thursday. (Peter Nicholls/Reuters)\n\nFarage is a charismatic but divisive figure -- he's among the right-wing politicians who've been pelted with milkshakes on the campaign trail.\n\nOver the course of the campaign, he has come under scrutiny over the source of his donations. The European Parliament said it would investigate allegations, broadcast by Britain's Channel 4, that Farage failed to declare more than $500,000 from British businessman Arron Banks in the year after the 2016 E.U. referendum.\n\nThe money allegedly went to pay Farage's rent, a car lease and a security detail and driver. Farage has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nA Brexit Party triumph could be good news for Boris Johnson, a prominent Brexiteer and former foreign secretary who is leading in polls to replace May.\n\nLike Farage, Johnson has downplayed risks of a \"no deal\" Brexit -- leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement and transition period. Many economists, however, have predicted leaving with no deal could create havoc for Britain and Europe.\n\nMarcus Roberts, international projects director at YouGov, said a big win for the Brexit Party could translate into a boost for Johnson, even though he's from the governing Conservatives.\n\n\"The longer they fail to deliver Brexit, the greater their need for self-flagellation becomes,\" Roberts said, referring to the Conservatives.\n\nThe party's calculation going forward, he said, could be to say, \"'yes, we failed to deliver Brexit but, to make up for that, we're going to pick the most Brexity-Brexiteer we can find.\"\n\nEuropean elections are taking place amid political uncertainty in Britain. (Henry Nicholls/Reuters)\n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has been vague about his stance on whether his party should support a second referendum on Brexit, as many want.\n\nBrian Feltham, 82, a retired chemist, decided to abandon his beloved Labour and vote Liberal Democrats because \"they are the party most likely to keep us in the E.U.\"\n\n\"It would be ridiculous if we were on our own,\" Feltham said. \"Once we were a different country, with an empire. Not anymore. We're much too small now.\"\n\nElizabeth Jago, 39, who was pushing her toddler in a buggy, said she had just voted Liberal Democrat because \"the LibDems will give us the best chance of making the best out of a bad situation.\"\n\n\"Normally I would vote Labour, but I reluctantly voted Liberal Democrats this time because they are anti-Brexit,\" said Norma McArthur, 63, a retired dentist who cast her ballot at a polling station set up at a London nursery school.\n\nAsked what Labour's policy on Brexit was, McArthur shrugged and said, \"I don't know what it is.\"\n\n\"This is mainly a Brexit referendum,\" she added.\n\nRead more\n\nTheresa May holds on, but House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom resigns\n\nFar-right parties hope to undermine E.U. by winning European elections\n\nIn what may be Britain's last European election, Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party is expected to dominate", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5GaF8Z6JX_KhEhyMOYpdjieQa8o=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EHTDQOT5OII6TDW66SV7KIPPC4.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800134", "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 296327340}, {"uri": "1143757222", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "16:06:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T16:06:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/eu-elections-primer-how-they-work-what-could-happen/2019/05/23/bce7668e-7d71-11e9-b1f3-b233fe5811ef_story.html", "title": "EU elections primer: How they work, what could happen", "body": "By Lorne Cook\u2009|\u2009AP May 23 at 11:45 AM\n\nBRUSSELS -- European voters started heading to the polls Thursday to choose lawmakers to represent them at the European Parliament for the next five years. In all, 400 million voters in 28 nations will be voting over the next four days. Here's a look at that massive exercise in democracy, a multi-national ballot by the European Union's only democratically elected institution.\n\n___\n\nWHO, WHEN, WHAT ON THE EU VOTE?\n\nEurope's voting marathon kicked off Thursday in the Netherlands and in Britain . Voters in Ireland turn out on Friday, those in the Czech Republic, Latvia, Malta and Slovakia vote on Saturday and the remaining 21 EU nations cast their ballots on Sunday.\n\nVoters in each EU nation choose some of the 751 lawmakers in the European Parliament, which sits in both Brussels and Strasbourg, France.\n\nSeats in the European Parliament are doled out proportionally based on a nation's population. Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta have the fewest seats with six each, while the EU's most populous member, Germany, has 96 seats.\n\nThe results from every nation will be released on Sunday after the last polling station in the continent is closed.\n\n___\n\nHOW IMPORTANT IS THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT?\n\nThe assembly's powers are slowly growing. It's helped to improve air flight safety in Europe, cut down plastics use, end mobile telephone roaming charges within the bloc, boost data privacy, set climate change ambitions and reduce carbon dioxide emissions from cars.\n\nThe assembly also has a say in treaties ranging from trade talks to Brexit.\n\nThe EU's powerful executive arm, the European Commission, proposes laws while EU lawmakers amend and negotiate their content with national governments, which are the real font of European power and are represented by the EU Council.\n\nOften, the big impact of these EU elections is on the domestic politics of individual EU nations, like support in Britain for the anti-Europe U.K. Independence Party in 2014 or the massive gains in France by Marine Le Pen's far-right National Front party, which has now rebranded as the National Rally. The polls are often used by disgruntled citizens to cast protest votes against their own national governments.\n\n___\n\nWHAT ARE THE ISSUES IN THE EU ELECTION?\n\nThere are no \"European citizens\" as such, so voters tend to respond to national interests.\n\nHow Europe handles migration is a very significant concern for voters in Italy, Hungary, Poland and elsewhere. Economic concerns often influence voters, and Britain's future in the EU looks like being a factor again.\n\nAn EU survey of public sentiment in April found that voters were most concerned about the economy, unemployment, immigration, the environment and climate change, terrorism and promoting human rights, democracy and social welfare.\n\n___\n\nWHO'S LIKELY TO WIN WHAT?\n\nThe projections from April suggest that the center-right European People's Party will remain the biggest bloc in the European Parliament with an estimated 180 seats, dropping from 217 seats in 2014.\n\nThe center-left Socialists and Democrats group is also expected to lose ground, sliding from 186 seats to 149.\n\nAmong other mainstream parties, the liberal ALDE alliance is expected to capture 76 seats, eight more than in 2014, while the Greens could rank fourth with some 57 seats, up from 52. However, the liberals now appear set to create a new group with French President Emmanuel Macron's centrist party.\n\nAs for the far-right and nationalists, the Europe of Nations and Freedom group, which combines parties like Italy's League, Britain's UKIP and France's far-right National Rally, is predicted to win 62 seats, compared to 37 currently.\n\nNew parties such the Brexit Party in Britain are listed as \"other\" in a mixed bunch that is forecast to expand from 21 seats to 62.\n\n___\n\nHOW WILL THE VOTE CHANGE EUROPE?\n\nEurope's mainstream political groups appear set to hold control over the assembly but, depending on the results, they could be pressured into uncomfortable compromises or awkward alliances in order to pass EU legislation.\n\nPopulist and nationalist parties have found rising support in national elections in many EU countries, but their pan-European impact would depend on whether they can form a strong political group in Brussels. That certainly is their goal. Italy's hard-line interior minister, Matteo Salvini, head of the League party, has been putting together a populist group of national parties that he says aims to fundamentally shake up EU politics.\n\nForming such a group is not easy -- 25 lawmakers are required, with at least one-quarter of the EU's 28 nations represented -- but it's important because it opens up valuable access to EU funds and political influence.\n\n___\n\nWHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE ELECTIONS?\n\nOnce the results are in, the newly elected EU lawmakers will begin haggling to form parliamentary groups.\n\nThe present European Parliament's term ends July 1 and the new parliament will take their seats in Strasbourg the following day. At the first plenary on July 2, they will elect the president, 14 vice presidents and five other senior officials in the House, as well as decide on the number and composition of parliamentary committees.\n\nEU leaders will meet on Tuesday to choose candidates for the bloc's top jobs. Between July and October, the assembly is called on to endorse those candidates, notably the new president of the European Commission. Parliamentary hearings will then begin to confirm EU commissioners in charge of specific policies.\n\n___\n\nFor more news from The Associated Press on the European Parliament elections go to https://www.apnews.com/EuropeanParliament\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

(J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post) By Kathy Orton Kathy Orton Reporter and editor covering the Washington metropolitan area housing market May 23 at 10:03 AM\n\nFixed mortgage rates didn't go down much, but they did go down for the fourth week in a row.\n\nAccording to the latest data released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate average slipped to 4.06 percent with an average 0.5 point. (Points are fees paid to a lender equal to 1 percent of the loan amount and are in addition to the interest rate.) It was 4.07 percent a week ago and 4.66 percent a year ago. The 30-year fixed rate matched its lowest level of the year, set back at the end of March.\n\nThe 15-year fixed-rate average dipped to 3.51 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 3.53 percent a week ago and 4.15 percent a year ago. The five-year adjustable rate average ticked up to 3.68 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 3.66 percent a week ago and 3.87 percent a year ago.\n\nZillow economic analyst Matthew Speakman said the lack of economic data released this week meant the financial markets focused more on the U.S.-China trade negotiations.\n\n\"The one event with the potential to drastically influence rates -- the reading of the minutes from last month's Federal Open Market Committee meeting -- offered little in the way of new forward guidance, keeping bond yields, which dictate mortgage rates, at bay,\" Speakman said. \"The U.S.-China trade tensions -- along with other geopolitical issues such as Brexit and intensifying political tensions in the Middle East -- have pushed rates downward in recent weeks. While substantial uncertainty remains, the pace of provocative headlines has subsided in recent days, which could result in some upward pressure on rates, if the trend holds. A sharp rebound appears unlikely, but so long as the trade tensions don't escalate and upcoming economic releases offer few surprises, modest rate increases could be on the horizon in the immediate term.\"\n\nBankrate.com, which puts out a weekly mortgage rate trend index, found that two-thirds of the experts it surveyed expect rates to remain relatively stable in the coming week.\n\n\"Pending clear direction on the trade dispute between the United States and China, interest rates will likely be directionless,\" said Robert Johnson, professor of finance at Creighton University.\n\nMeanwhile, fueled by borrowers looking to refinance their loans, mortgage applications picked up. According to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the market composite index -- a measure of total loan application volume -- increased 2.4 percent from a week earlier. The refinance index grew 8 percent from the previous week, while the purchase index dropped 2 percent.\n\nThe refinance share of mortgage activity accounted for 40.5 percent of all applications.\n\n\"Mortgage applications increased 2.4 percent last week and were 15.4 percent higher than a year ago, with declining mortgage rates leading to a jump in refinance activity,\" said Bob Broeksmit, MBA president and CEO. \"Despite lower borrowing costs, purchase applications were slightly down but maintained their 14-week run of outpacing year ago levels. Supply and affordability challenges are still slowing some prospective buyers, but most of the country continues to see strong demand.\"\n\nMore Real Estate:\n\nHome lenders are becoming more friendly to riskier applicants\n\nNeed a boost to your credit rating?

Putin of Russia stirs strong emotions in Britain.\n\nNow, the BBC is hoping to mine the Russian leader's fame -- or infamy -- with a comedy series presented by a digital effigy of Mr. Putin, who cackles in a trailer for the program that his next great geopolitical victory will be to host the \"No. 1 chat show in the U.K.\"\n\nThe satirical show, called \"Tonight With Vladimir Putin,\" uses a three-dimensional cartoon of Mr. Putin interviewing real guests in front of an audience, the BBC announced on Wednesday.\n\nWhether the Kremlin will see the funny side is debatable.\n\n\"He doesn't often get mocked and I don't think that he'll like it,\" said Joanna Szostek, a lecturer in political communication at the University of Glasgow.\n\n\"It's not going to help bilateral relations, obviously,\" Dr. Szostek added, noting that Moscow was likely to see the show as politically motivated because it considered the BBC a propaganda arm of the British government. The tone of the show could feed the Kremlin narrative that Western criticism of Mr. Putin was driven by an anti-Russian agenda, she said.\n\nThe Putin caricature begins the trailer provocatively. \"Greetings, people of the 'United Kingdom'!\" the digital puppet yells outside Buckingham Palace, miming air quotes in a less-than-subtle reference to the bruising political battles around Britain's departure from the European Union and the fractious elections for the European Parliament which are being held this week.\n\nIn the first episode, planned to air on June 14, \"Mr. Putin\" -- or \"everybody's favorite bear-wrestling global strongman,\" as the BBC described him -- will meet Alastair Campbell, the onetime spokesman for former Prime Minister Tony Blair. In the next episode, the digital host will try \"to get his head around feminism\" in a discussion with the comedian and podcaster Deborah Frances-White, according to the statement.\n\nThe sharp intake of breath from observers of Russian politics was almost audible after the BBC's announcement. Comments on Twitter from Moscow-based journalists and researchers included a face-palm emoji in reaction to the puppet's accent and a warning that the broadcaster was \"playing with fire.\"\n\nIn Russia, such a caricature would be unthinkable nowadays. A show in the 1990s on the Russian network NTV, called \"Puppets,\" featured a cartoon figure of Mr. Putin and other prominent politicians, including former President Boris Yeltsin. But the show was discontinued soon after Mr. Putin assumed the presidency in 2000 and nothing like it has been shown on television since.\n\nDmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesman, dismissed the BBC show in a conference call with journalists on Friday. \"Lots of books have been written about Putin, lots of caricatures have been drawn, lots of puppets and cartoons have been created,\" he said.\n\n\"Putin hasn't read books about himself or looked at caricatures,\" Mr. Peskov added. \"He doesn't want to take after them. Let these caricatures take after him.\"\n\nRussia Today, the English-language network that is widely seen as part of the Kremlin's propaganda machine, also raised an arched eyebrow.\n\n\"The show appears to be a regurgitated dystopian nightmare,\" the Russian broadcaster said on its website.\n\n\"Surprisingly, many people were able to overcome bouts of nausea and cringe-induced spasms long enough to air their disgust,\" the article continued, citing negative reaction on Twitter.\n\nA spokeswoman for the BBC said on Wednesday that the show's creators would not be available to comment.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "palko_karasz@nytimes.com", "name": "Palko Karasz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/22/world/22bbc-putin/22bbc-putin-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4804631", "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 296309940}, {"uri": "1143536516", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "11:39:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T11:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/23/is-this-end-theresa-may-ban-reporting-during-eu-elections-means-viewers-wont-know-yet/", "title": "Is this the end for Theresa May?

REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/File Photo (Henry Nicholls/Reuters) By Rick Noack Rick Noack Foreign affairs reporter focusing on Europe and international security May 23 at 7:07 AM\n\nIf you looked at a British newspaper front page on Thursday, you would get the impression of a political apocalypse -- at least if you're a fan of Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\n\"TEARESA,\" The Sun newspaper writes, illustrated with a photo of an emotional May in the back seat of her car.\n\n\"TEARS IN THE BACK SEAT 2,\" is the Daily Mirror's version of events, a clear reference to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's tearful departure after being ousted in 1990.\n\nIn the late evening hours on Wednesday, House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom quit the government cabinet in another blow to the troubled prime minister.\n\nThere is no evidence to substantiate rumors that May's downfall would happen today, but the next hours may still be fateful for her future.\n\n[Theresa May holds on, but House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom resigns]\n\nNormally, it should become one of those days: A nation glued to TV screens or smartphone livestreams, waiting for what's been described as the inevitable for several months now -- maneuvering about May's potential departure.\n\nBut those living in Britain might have to wait until 10 p.m. to find out all the details from their televisions.\n\nOddly, one of the perhaps most fateful weeks in recent British political history coincides with yet another politically fateful week for the future of the European Union. About 400 million Europeans across the E.U. are eligible to vote in European Parliament elections. Not everyone is voting at the same time. On Sunday, for instance, it will be the Germans' turn. Today, it's the turn of a nation that didn't even want to be in the club of E.U. member states anymore: Britain.\n\nAfter a chaotic exit from the exit in March, British lawmakers struggled to agree on how exactly they would like to leave. Many blame May for failing to consult them over the last two years and for pushing them to agree to her deal, which a majority of MPs say is deeply flawed.\n\nThat's why they want May to go.\n\nBut that's also why British broadcasters might struggle to fully report on it today, of all days.\n\nGiven that Brits are heading to E.U. polls today, strict reporting laws are taking effect that may prevent certain developments from becoming widely known until tonight, after polls across the E.U. have closed by 10 p.m. British time. \"There will be no coverage of the election campaign on polling day, from 00.30 until polls close at 22.00 on TV, radio or bbc.co.uk,\" the BBC states on its website.\n\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg already said goodbye (\"in theory\") to her Twitter followers on Wednesday night, adding \"that's more or less it from me\" until the restrictions end.\n\nThe BBC did not completely ignore rumors over May's looming departure this morning, but if those rumors proved to be true the broadcaster could face a host of problems across its airwaves.\n\nSome restrictions will remain in place until Sunday, when polls have closed across the continent, even though newspapers and most websites are not impacted by those rules.\n\n\"Whilst the polls are open throughout Europe, it is a criminal offence to broadcast anything about the way in which people have voted in that election or to forecast the election result, which includes how a particular party or candidate may have fared, based on how people have voted,\" the BBC's guidelines state.\n\nThat means, if May's opponents changed existing rules to topple her or if she resigned herself -- citing potentially devastating results for her Conservative Party in the European elections -- the BBC wouldn't be able to report on those reasons. If politicians said anything along those lines live on air, they may have to be cut off until Sunday, The Guardian newspaper reported.\n\nThat sounds more similar to the experience of watching Western TV in countries like China and stands in a stark contrast to the United States, where election days draw huge audience numbers so that people can know what's going on with the voting.\n\nIn comparison, British TV on election days is relatively boring. News anchors will pretty much say: The vote is happening -- and now, the weather.\n\nThe idea is that last-minute scandals or developments could swing a vote, without giving journalists proper time to investigate the stories or politicians time to react. Then-FBI Director James Comey's announcement of a reopened Clinton email probe days ahead of the election proved that the British may have a point here.\n\nBritain also isn't the only country with such restrictions. France, for instance, has a similar rule that takes effect 44 hours before legislative or presidential elections. During those two days, French media outlets are banned from covering \"electoral propaganda,\" but that could include anything from statements from candidates to electoral polls.\n\nIt's a rule that's designed to preserve the integrity of elections in which voters can topple the current political leader.\n\nBut today isn't one of those days: European elections (theoretically) only determine the composition of the future European Parliament, but have no direct impact on May's ability to govern at home.\n\nThat's why, if there are dramatic developments on May's future, British broadcasters may push the limits of those rules until 10 p.m.\n\nIn a polarized Britain, many might have made up their minds before then, anyway.\n\nMilkshake-wielding protesters trap Nigel Farage on his Brexit bus\n\nTheresa May holds on, but House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom resigns", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ut8N8wqkAzyPEAVy8YcO_b6F2zo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/47YTQED4XQI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 296307540}, {"uri": "1143484020", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "10:36:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T10:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/23/things-know-about-european-parliament-elections/", "title": "Five things to know about Europe's surprisingly dramatic parliamentary elections", "body": "(Washington Post illustration/iStock) By Ruby Mellen Ruby Mellen Research assistant for the Today's WorldView newsletter May 23 at 6:00 AM\n\nAcross Europe, voting begins Thursday in European Parliament elections, which will continue through Sunday. The elections are hotly anticipated across the continent, with many people wondering how the results will affect the future of the European Union and the bloc's dealings with the rest of the world. With the help of our correspondents in Europe, we answer five key questions about the elections and the legislative body.\n\nWhat is the European Parliament?\n\nThe 751-member legislature is most notable for being, as Deutsche Welle puts it, \"the only democratically legitimized supranational institution in the world.\" In other words: It is the only assembly made of various countries where the people of those countries can directly vote for their representatives. It is also notable for the large numbers of voters in its elections. More than 370 million people are eligible to vote, making these the second largest elections in the world, behind India's.\n\nMembers of European Parliament are sent as representatives of the 28 countries in the E.U. Each country decides how the elections are held. Anything goes as long as the ballots are secret and women and men can both vote. (The voting age is 18 everywhere but Austria, where it is 16.) Seats are apportioned to each country according to the size of its population. Germany, the E.U.'s most populous state, has 96 representatives, while small countries like Cyprus, Malta and Luxembourg have six each. That said, members of the European Parliament -- or MEPs -- do not always vote along nationality lines. Once elected to the European Parliament, they join larger parties and coalitions.\n\nMEPs are elected to five-year terms and have a say in the bloc's finances, international presence and general direction. Since the Lisbon Treaty of 2009, which expanded the body's powers, the European Parliament has appointed the head of the European Commission, the E.U.'s executive body, approved or rejected international agreements such as a recent trade pact with Singapore, and decided on the E.U.'s full budget. The body is involved in decisions on a vast array of topics, including agriculture and fisheries, environmental issues and migration policies.\n\nWho are the key players to watch for in these elections?\n\nThere are eight political groups in the European Parliament. Forming a group requires at least 25 members from at least seven countries. The largest groups are the center-right European People's Party (EPP) and the center-left Socialists and Democrats. Both are expected to lose seats as voters show an appetite for more-extreme views on the left and the right.\n\nThe EPP is likely to lose seats to more-nationalist and Euroskeptic parties. This will be especially crucial in the case of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party. The EPP suspended Fidesz in March over its rejection of E.U. migration policies. Now Orban is calling for the group to join forces with far-right parties such as Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini's League party, and French politician Marine Le Pen's National Rally. The head of the EPP has already ruled out such an alliance, but, as Politico noted, Orban has said \"he would find it hard to stick with the EPP if it forms an alliance with 'pro-migration' parties on the left.\"\n\nIt's also worth keeping an eye on the fortunes of Britain's Euroskeptic Brexit Party, which is led by Nigel Farage. A recent poll showed the Brexit Party has more support than Britain's mainstream liberal and conservative parties combined -- a little bit ironic considering that if the party had its way, Britain would already be out of the E.U. and not be represented in European Parliament at all.\n\nMeanwhile, on the left, other parties are expected to gain ground. According to the Associated Press, polling in April showed that the progressive Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, backed by French President Emmanuel Macron, is projected to gain eight seats, bringing its number to 76, and that the Green party could win 57 seats, five more than it now holds.\n\nUltimately, the new Parliament could reflect what is occurring in governments all around Europe: a weakening of the center that is forcing political realignment on the major issues shaping the world.\n\nWait, there's a Brexit Party? What does that mean for Brexit? (From the London bureau's William Booth and Karla Adam)\n\nYep. This is an election few thought would occur in Britain, given that the country voted three years ago to leave the E.U. and was to have quit the bloc two months ago. The questions are understandable. Will Britain's 73 new representatives to the E.U.'s legislative body serve for days, weeks or years? Who knows? The chaos is made more sensational by the forecast that this nascent, single-issue party is going to blow everyone else out of the water, with the potential to influence how Brexit turns out and how long Prime Minister Theresa May stays in office. The demands of the Brexit Party seem simple: Get us out of the E.U. Now. Honor the 2016 referendum result.\n\nA big win for the Brexit Party could push May and her Conservatives to hurriedly pass a deal before parliamentarians take up their seats in July, or, as Farage prefers, leave the E.U. with no deal. Writing in the Guardian, former Labour prime minister Tony Blair described the stakes: \"This is not a vote to choose a prime minister or a government. It is a vote for the Farage Brexit -- or against it.\"\n\nAlternatively, a good showing from the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats or Change UK might embolden those in the British Parliament who want a second referendum on Brexit.\n\nWhat about the far right? What does it hope to gain? (From Brussels bureau chief Michael Birnbaum and Berlin bureau chief Griff Witte)\n\nSince the last election in 2014, the E.U. has been hammered by a refugee crisis, multiple mass-casualty terrorist attacks, a vote by the British people to exit the bloc, a security scare fueled by the Kremlin and a fitful economic recovery after the global financial crisis. Such issues are pulling voters to the fringes, and far-right and other parties that are hostile to the E.U. appear poised to control more seats than ever before.\n\nFrom grand palazzi in Rome to Art Nouveau villas in Budapest, Europe's anti-migration right-wingers have been prepping their battering rams to knock down the doors of the European Parliament. No one expects them to win a majority, but their aim is less to legislate than to obstruct. A greater far-right presence could have a disproportionate effect on how the E.U. functions, putting the far right in a position to play spoiler. And a legislature with less ability to get things done would feed the narrative of the E.U.'s nationalist critics, who argue that the bloc is fundamentally broken.\n\nBut for Europe's critics to wield maximum influence, they will need to work together -- something they have failed to do so far.\n\nWith all these Euroskeptic players involved, is there a threat of Russian interference in these elections? (From Brussels bureau chief Michael Birnbaum)\n\nIt doesn't seem likely. At least yet. Parliament, politicians, security services and social media companies that were bracing for an onslaught from Russia have been surprised that, so far, they seem to have avoided one.\n\nExperts are cautious about saying Russian interference has been neutralized, but the anxiety has shifted somewhat inward, as many of the disinformation tactics pioneered by Russia have been domesticated and are being replicated on both extremes of the political debate in Europe.\n\nThat said, Russia is still working openly to promote political division in Europe. The Sputnik news agency has offered wall-to-wall coverage of the \"yellow vest\" protests that have shaken France. The German-language homepage of RT, formerly Russia Today, recently featured a banner debunking \"myths\" that the former West Germany was superior to communist East Germany. But the scale of what has been identified is nothing compared with the past -- or with what the Europeans had anticipated.\n\nIn part, far-right parties in Europe have not needed Russia, because some of their domestic supporters have mimicked Russia's strategy of promoting disinformation and amplifying it through the use of automated social media accounts.\n\nRead more:\n\nIn what may be Britain's last European election, Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party is expected to dominate\n\nFar-right parties hope to undermine E.U. by winning European elections\n\nEurope's far right says it is united.

Even when they are tearfully coming apart, the characters share with Thompson an ironclad sense of self and of how things ought to be.\n\nTime did not soften this Thompsonian resolve, or so it seemed. This year, after learning that John Lasseter, who lost his top job at Pixar and Disney for unwanted touching, was named head of the studio producing a film she was working on, Thompson publicly quit and flamed the studio, and Lasseter, in a scathing open letter. A few months before that, she showed up in white sneakers to her knighthood ceremony, which was led by Prince William. When the English press affected shock, Thompson shot back that the shoes were designed by Stella McCartney, thank you very much, and actually quite posh.\n\nIt came as a great surprise to Thompson, then, to suddenly find herself on uncertain ground occasioned by her 60th birthday in April. It was not that she balked at her age. Suggestions of \"60 is the new 40!\" make her eyes roll. \"The denial of aging is unhealthy,\" she sniffed in a recent chat. \"It's always been bollocks.\" But she was flooded by discomfiting questions of her own about roles she had enthusiastically embraced throughout her life: as daughter, wife, mother, performer. She was still all of those things, but now she's on the verge of being an empty nester.\n\n\"There's lots of these roles that are in fact imposed on you by society, for years and years and years, then you suddenly go -- am I any of those things? And if I'm not, who am I?\" Thompson said.\n\n\"The eternal question, which I never thought I'd ask, is who am I?\" she continued. \"I was always so sure. As it turns out, I have no idea.\"\n\nThompson had scheduled our interview between her first ever trip to Las Vegas, which she found \"eye-watering,\" and an appearance at the Extinction Rebellion environmental protest in London, where she was filmed speechifying into a mic in a pink boat surrounded by police.\n\nShe had gone to Vegas to promote two new movies at a convention of theater owners: \"Late Night,\" which Mindy Kaling wrote for her, and \"Last Christmas,\" which Thompson wrote with the English artist Bryony Kimmings, and which is loosely based, somehow, on the song of the same name by the '80s group Wham!\n\nIn Vegas, Thompson had an 11-hour break between presentations, during which time she gambled, napped, ate and drank. By the end of the day, she felt like she had been there for 50 years, wondered if that was what everybody in Vegas felt, and was seized by the need to escape lest she suffocate and die.\n\nThe Extinction Rebellion protesters, by contrast, exhilarated her, so much so she made a short film in their support. Thompson is a lifelong environmentalist and tries to stay optimistic, having read that optimists live longer, yet, like so many earthlings these days, has trouble warding off eco-despair. \"Cara,\" she said, \"we are in a race, as you know, against consciousness and catastrophe.\"\n\nWe were sitting in a suite at a swanky Beverly Hills hotel that was all genteel charcoals and dove grays. Against it, Thompson was a kinetic pop. Her platinum plume of hair was in a state of floppy disarray suggestive of multiple rakings by harried fingers, and she had on her famous Stella McCartney sneakers along with an ensemble the color of lime sorbet, which I murmured appreciation for; it was a palate cleanser, just like her! \"It's pistachio, darling,\" she corrected.\n\nAmericans tend to view Thompson the way they do many of her fellow dames -- Dench, Mirren, Smith -- as a beloved no-nonsense Mary Poppins type highly adept at setting people straight. But back home in England, Thompson's outspokenness and environmentalism have at times put her in the cross hairs of the country's outrage-industrial complex. The press pilloried her for describing England, in the run-up to the Brexit vote, as a \"cake-filled, misery-laden gray old island,\" and gloated when an irate farmer came close to drenching her with manure during an anti-fracking protest in 2016.\n\nThompson professes to not care a bit. \"The Murdochian press are a law unto themselves,\" she said. She is far more concerned not just with the fate of the planet but also the minor matter of figuring out who exactly she is. \"I have some questions that I hope to answer in the next 10 years,\" she said.\n\nThompson grew up in an acting family. Her father, Eric Thompson, created and performed the English version of \"The Magic Roundabout\" children's show, and her mother is the Scottish actress Phyllida Law. Thompson went to Cambridge, joined the Cambridge Footlights comedy sketch revue, befriended Stephen Fry, dated Hugh Laurie and, in the late '80s, fell in love with and married Kenneth Branagh, whom she met while working on a World War II-era television drama.\n\nA few years later, the director James Ivory cast her in her breakthrough role in the British class drama \"Howards End\" as the well-heeled, earnest Margaret Schlegel, who gets involved with Anthony Hopkins's upper-crust widower. She won an Oscar for her performance, and landed two more Oscar nominations (lead and supporting actress) the following year, for \"The Remains of the Day\" and \"In the Name of the Father.\" Branagh, meanwhile, had taken a shine to Thompson's \"Howards End\" co-star, Helena Bonham Carter, whom he'd worked with on his 1994 film, \"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.\" Branagh and Carter ended up in a relationship and he and Thompson divorced in 1995, a year that would prove a major inflection point in Thompson's life.\n\nThe producer Lindsay Doran had caught a television broadcast of Thompson's comedy sketches, and asked her to adapt Jane Austen's \"Sense and Sensibility.\" Directed by Ang Lee and starring Thompson, Kate Winslet and Hugh Grant, the 1995 film was a global hit. Thompson went on to win an Oscar for best adapted screenplay, making her the only person to win Academy Awards for both acting and writing. The film also starred Greg Wise as the dashing, dastardly John Willoughby. She and Wise, seven years her junior, ended up hitting it off splendidly. They married in 2003 and have a daughter, Gaia, who is 19, and an adopted son, Tindyebwa Agaba, a former refugee and child soldier. Wise's recent gigs include appearing as Lord Mountbatten on \"The Crown\" and a winning turn on \"The Great Celebrity Bake Off.\" Thompson said that after she was knighted, Wise asked her if he could be known as Lady Greg. No, alas, per Order of the British Empire rules.\n\nThompson had shot to international stardom in her 30s, but she said that by the time she hit her 40s, she was being offered the dullest of roles -- she guesses because she could still be thought of, \"in a pinch,\" as sexual. But once she got into her 50s and past all that, the parts that came her way were far more interesting.\n\nThey included the finicky \"Mary Poppins\" author P.L. Travers in \"Saving Mr. Banks\" (\"Such a wonderful role. I even managed to live with the perm\"); the harridan chain-smoker of a mother in \"Barney Thomson,\" about a Scottish serial killer; and, in Noah Baumbach's \"The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),\" the drunken wife of Dustin Hoffman's narcissistic washed-up artist.\n\nThompson adored working with Hoffman, and said it was only afterward that she learned of accusations of impropriety made against him -- Hoffman responded to one allegation with an apology, and when others surfaced, denied wrongdoing -- and that she would have to talk to him before considering working with him again.\n\nOn the Lasseter matter, she was far more clear. Though he apologized for his behavior, Thompson admonished the studio, Skydance Animation, for potentially forcing employees into deciding between uncomfortably working with Lasseter or not working at all. After her letter went public, Thompson said, thanks came in from others who walked away from Skydance jobs for the same reason. \"They're the ones who are brave,\" she said. \"I can go onto another project and get paid. For other people, it's not so easy.\"\n\nI asked her about how men like Lasseter who have been #Me Too-ed might come back.\n\n\"I don't want to be thinking about men's problems at the moment, thanks so much,\" Thompson said. She said she had given the issue some thought and acknowledged it was thorny, but added, speaking of the men, \"I'm sure they'll grow up and sort it out. Because it's their problem, not mine.\" She would far rather talk about women. \"If you get born into this body, it's a different journey,\" she said. \"Whether you like it or not.\"\n\nThompson's big beef with most roles written for women is that they have gone from one extreme to the other, from the hopelessly domestic support-or-pine-for-a-man characters she felt swamped with early in her career, to, these days, women being straight-out badasses.\n\n\"Women now invent the weapons and shoot the weapons and are tough and not allowed to cry,\" Thompson said. \"We skipped from being in the kitchen to being in the tank, and there's nothing in between. So we still have failed to explore and bring to the screen what being a woman is.\"\n\nAn exception, she said, was \"Late Night,\" which Thompson described as one of the best scripts she'd read.\n\nIn it, Thompson plays a sharp-tongued late-night host, Katherine Newbury, who reluctantly hires a token woman (Kaling) for her all-male writing staff in an effort to keep her show relevant and on the air. Kaling wrote the part for Thompson (Vanity Fair called it her \"best role in years\") because she needed someone who could get away with saying almost anything. \"I knew Katherine would be cruel at times but always needed to be funny,\" Kaling said.\n\nThompson and Kaling crafted Newbury as a composite of hard-driving people they knew. Like Thompson, Newbury is tough and complex. Unlike her, she is an anti-feminist who does nothing to pull other women up, at least until she feels she has to. \"She's very single-minded, shall we say, which is generally thought of as a male trait,\" Thompson said. \"And men are allowed to be single-minded, aren't they?\"\n\nCircling back to Thompson's earlier years, I asked James Ivory what it was about Thompson that prompted him to cast her in \"Howards End.\" He replied that he was struck by her groundedness and brights. She was simply, he said, so very sane.\n\n\"A lot of actors and actresses are very fearful and timid and cover that up with all kinds of strange behavior you could call crazy, forever thinking they're not good, that they're failing,\" Ivory told me. \"There was none of that with her.\" She also smoothed out some on-set tensions he had with Hopkins, becoming the go-between both men trusted. By the time filming ended, Ivory said, he felt he had a great friend in Thompson. He was also a bit forlorn: \"There was really a sense of loss that this delightful person wasn't going to be around every day.\"\n\nThompson has this effect on people. That includes me -- even though I spent just 90 minutes with her -- and Nisha Ganatra, who directed \"Late Night.\"\n\nDuring production, Ganatra said she studied Thompson closely, trying to figure out how the actress seemed to live her life with such brilliance and grace. She concluded it had a lot to do with Thompson being present and humble. Ganatra watched as Thompson passed out Italian chocolates late one night to the crew, and reached up to absent-mindedly stroke the leaves of a tree she walked under one rainy day.\n\nGanatra said she found herself wanting Thompson to be her confidant and her life coach. \"I wanted to be her,\" Ganatra said.\n\nIndeed, Thompson may profess to not know who she is anymore, but to the rest of the world, it is, as always, crystal clear.\n\n\"I asked her, 'What's it like to have all the answers?'\" Ganatra said. \"She just laughed and said, 'I don't.' But she does.\"\n\nMore on Emma ThompsonEmma Thompson Letter Explains Why She Backed Out of Movie Over LasseterFeb. 26, 2019Sundance 2019 Movies That Could Become Oscar ContendersFeb. 1, 2019", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cara_buckley@nytimes.com", "name": "Cara Buckley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/26/arts/26emma-thompson-2/26emma-thompson-2-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4807442", "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 296295000}, {"uri": "1143307230", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "06:44:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T06:44:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/dutch-polls-open-kicking-off-4-days-of-european-elections/2019/05/23/66c72ae6-7d1c-11e9-b1f3-b233fe5811ef_story.html", "title": "Dutch, UK polls open, starting 4 days of European elections", "body": "By Mike Corder\u2009|\u2009AP May 23 at 1:59 AM\n\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Dutch polls opened Thursday in elections for the European Parliament, starting four days of voting across the 28-nation bloc that pits supporters of deeper integration against populist Euroskeptics who want more power for their national governments.\n\nA half hour after voting started in the Netherlands, polls open across the United Kingdom, the only other country voting Thursday, and a nation still wrestling with its plans to leave the European Union altogether and the leadership of embattled Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\nThe elections, which end Sunday night, come as support is surging for populists and nationalists who want to rein in the EU's powers, while traditional powerhouses like France and Germany insist that unity is the best buffer against the shifting economic and security interests of an emerging new world order.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron says the challenge is \"not cede to a coalition of destruction and disintegration\" that will seek to dismantle EU unity built up over the past six decades.\n\nIn a significant challenge to those centrist forces, populists appear largely united heading into the elections. On Saturday, Italy's anti-migrant Interior Minister Matteo Salvini was joined at a rally by 10 other nationalist leaders, including include far-right leaders Marine Le Pen of France's National Rally party and Joerg Meuthen of the Alternative for Germany party.\n\nVoters across Europe elect a total of 751 lawmakers, although that number is set to drop to 705 when the UK leaves the EU. The Dutch make up just 26 currently and 29 after Brexit. The UK has 73 European lawmakers, who would lose their jobs when their country completes its messy divorce from the EU.\n\nResults of the four days of voting will not be officially released until Sunday night, but Dutch national broadcaster NOS will publish an exit poll after ballot boxes close Thursday night.\n\nThe Netherlands could provide a snapshot of what is to come. Polls show the right-wing populist Forum for Democracy led by charismatic intellectual Thierry Baudet running neck-and-neck with the center-right VVD party of Prime Minister Mark Rutte.\n\nWhile the country, an affluent trading nation, profits from the EU's open borders and single market, it also is a major contributor to EU coffers. Skeptical Dutch voters in 2005 rejected a proposed EU constitution in a referendum.\n\nBaudet, whose party emerged as a surprise winner of provincial elections in March, identifies more with hard-line Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban than with the nationalist populist movement led by Salvini, although in a debate Wednesday night he called Salvini a \"hero of Europe\" for his crackdown on migration.\n\n\"The immigration we get here from Africa and the Mideast is completely contrary to our culture, our values, our way of life, tolerance, love of women and so on,\" Baudet said. \"That has to stop and it will not happen at the European level.\"\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Freedom, Slavery, Austerity or Nothing at All", "body": "As Europeans go to the polls in a Continental election, a New York Times reporter set out to find out what Europe means to Europeans in 2019.\n\nIn his front yard in Poland, Jaroslaw Kurski flies the European Union flag, blue with a circle of yellow stars, and he carries one during street protests against a nationalist government that has chipped away at his country's young democracy.\n\n\"The European flag has become the symbol of resistance,\" said Mr. Kurski, the deputy editor of Gazeta Wyborcza, a liberal newspaper based in Warsaw.\n\nIn northern France, Guy F\u00fcnfrock and fellow Yellow Vest protesters at a rainy traffic roundabout talk about resistance, too, but defiantly fly the French tricolor. To them, Europe embodies everything they have come to hate: shuttered factories, stagnating wages and a young banker-turned-president who champions deeper integration.\n\n\"This Europe serves big business, not the little people,\" said Mr. F\u00fcnfrock, a retired carpenter.\n\nI met Mr. Kurski and Mr. F\u00fcnfrock on a 10-day journey through the European Union before the Continent votes from Thursday through Sunday for the European Parliament. I wanted to know: What does Europe mean to Europeans today?\n\nThe election has shaped up as a battle for the soul of Europe -- between those who want more Europe and those who would water it down. The decades-old project of unity has rarely been more precarious.\n\nThe European Union has grown in successive waves for different reasons -- democratizing and developing new members, always with the idea that prosperity and shared values would enhance security for all.\n\nToday that expansion has left the bloc laboring under the weight of its own ideals and ambitions.\n\nI retraced its origin story, starting at the French-German border, where it all began after World War II. Then to Italy, the country where the founding treaty was signed by just six members. I ended in the post-Communist east, where Europe's newest members, and many of its poorest, joined after the Cold War, eventually bringing the group to 28.\n\nBy the end, I felt disoriented, and realized many Europeans did, too. \"Freedom,\" a German professor said, when asked what the European Union meant to him. \"Slavery,\" an Italian grandmother said. \"Nothing at all,\" a French electrician said.\n\nBut almost no one wanted their country to leave the European Union, even if almost no one was happy with how it was working.\n\nHope competed with disillusionment, I found. The balance almost invariably depended on opportunity -- whether the idea of Europe had opened doors to prosperity, or let in unwanted threats in the form of new states, new values or new people.\n\nIn the sleepy Tuscan town of Cascina, Italy, I met a Catholic priest who fretted that Europe had lost its way.\n\n\"We're living a big crisis,\" the Rev. Elvis Ragusa, 36, said, sitting in an office next to his small church.\n\nAs a child, he watched an Italian television series called \"Europe Is Us.\" There was also a game show that offered up to 1 million lira to the first person to call in and shout \"Europa, Europa!\" live on air.\n\nIt was the 1990s and Europe meant prosperity. \"I grew up with that idea that Europe was our future,\" Father Ragusa recalled.\n\nBut for a new generation, Europe has become synonymous with austerity and the perils of open borders.\n\nFather Ragusa's town had voted for the left for seven decades. But three years ago, it became the first Tuscan town to switch allegiance to the hard-right, anti-immigrant League party of Matteo Salvini, Europe's most flamboyant populist leader.\n\nThe priest took a small plastic globe off his bookshelf and spun it to show a flagrantly outsized Italian boot protruding from Europe. This is how Italians like to think of Italy today, he said.\n\nNationalism is winning. \"It could be very dangerous,\" he said.\n\nHis words came back to me in Arezzo, Italy, where an engineer recalled his shock when his 16-year-old daughter gave the thumbs up after she heard on the news that a hundred migrants had drowned.\n\n\"Good,\" she had said, \"that's a hundred less coming to Italy.\" Then, seeing her father's face, she added: \"Look, Dad, don't be so shocked, everyone thinks this.\"\n\nA French teacher from Normandy told me how his students started describing immigrants as \"rats\" during the 2015 migrant crisis.\n\nAfter that, he started signing them up for a European exchange program, Erasmus. I met him and his students on the plane to Gdansk, Poland.\n\n\"I thought: What can we do at our level to open these kids up to humanist ideas, to the idea of Europe?\" the teacher, Mathieu Le Parquois, told me. His grandmother had been deported during World War II, but that was ancient history for his students.\n\n\"Not even their grandparents experienced it,\" he said.\n\nThe place where I still found abundant idealism was in Strasbourg, France, on the border with Germany, where people did remember that history.\n\nThere, I met Rita Lemmel, the daughter of a German prisoner of war, who married a French factory worker. Their daughter has both passports, speaks both languages, lives in France and works in Germany. All three dream of a United States of Europe, American-style.\n\n\"We should have a president, and governors in each country,\" said her French husband, Bruno Lemmel.\n\nBut more often, I found that the European Union had become a proxy for big abstract things that people feel threaten their way of life: Migration in Italy. Capitalism in France. Liberal secular values in Poland.\n\nSome were contemplating liberal democracy itself.\n\n\"Is it the best system we have? And for whom?\" asked Wit Nirski, a 36-year-old advertisement strategist I met on the train from Warsaw back to Berlin. \"Is it the best system for growth, is it the best system for people?\"\n\n\"If people were happy,\" he added, \"why would the populists gain?\"\n\nNowhere did the conversations feel as raw as in Poland, where freedom is both recent and fragile.\n\nGdansk -- the city where World War II started; where the Solidarity union that brought down Communism was born; where Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, was born, too -- was still reeling from the fatal stabbing this year of its mayor, Pawel Adamowicz.\n\nHis widow, Magdalena Adamowicz, is running in the European elections after her husband's murder because, as she put it, Europe means \"tolerance.\"\n\nBoth of her grandmothers survived Auschwitz, she told me. \"If you set people against each other, then you can have the same story as before,\" she said. The week before I was with her, Polish state television showed images of Mr. Tusk next to images of Hitler and Stalin.\n\nMr. Kurski, the editor, told me that his paper faces some 30 lawsuits, several from the nationalist government.\n\nThe European Union and the European Court of Justice are important allies, Mr. Kurski said. \"Without the European Union,\" he said, \"Poland would be an authoritarian state.\"\n\nYet in the small Polish town of Swiebodzin, whose claim to fame is a giant statue of Jesus, several people told me that Europe stands for diktat and secularization.\n\n\"The E.U. is dictating conditions to Poland,\" said a local resident named Borzena, 59, as she stepped out from an evening Mass. Gay marriage and gay adoption were not welcome here, she said.\n\nOpposite the church, a nationalist election poster showed the campaign slogan of the governing Law and Justice party: \"Poland is the heart of Europe.\"\n\nPoland's nationalists do not want to take Poland out of the European Union. They want to take the European Union out of Poland.\n\n\"We are Polish and we want to stay Polish,\" Danuta Bialooka-Kostenecka, a local politician in the north, told me.\n\nEverywhere people wanted their own nation \"first.\" Especially in Italy.\n\nI spent a day on the campaign trail with Susanna Ceccardi, a 32-year-old rising star of the League, who says Europe is at risk of being Islamized.\n\nAs mayor of Cascina, she has instructed the police to remove immigrant hawkers, hired private security guards outside schools and handed out pepper spray to Italian women in her town. She was distributing fliers one recent Saturday, promising to fight \"bureaucrats in Brussels.\"\n\nLike on that Tuscan square, where the League was the only party campaigning, in Kehl, a contented western German town where the streets are clean, the cars are big and unemployment is low, the only campaign stall I saw belonged to a far-right party, Alternative for Germany.\n\nIts slogan -- \"Secure the Borders!\" -- made me think of all the times I had crossed borders on this journey, while barely noticing.\n\nI walked across the Rhine, once a front line between France and Germany.\n\nI took the train from Poland back to Germany, crossing the Oder, another river name associated with a front line.\n\nBut where physical borders have melted away, other borders have risen. Borders between cities and countryside, borders between young and old and, above all, between rich and poor.\n\nThose borders have grown taller, said Jeremy Klein, one of the Yellow Vest protesters on the roundabout of Thillois, outside of Reims, France.\n\nAn electrician, Mr. Klein works 60-hour weeks and still struggles. He blames Europe. It was after the former Soviet bloc countries joined the European Union that things got tough in France, he said.\n\n\"We have sold our know-how to Europe and now we are in competition with workers who are paid less than us,\" he said. \"We're just competing with Europe. It is not a fair Europe. I don't feel European at all. I am French, only French.\"\n\nThe Kleins have never voted and do not plan to vote in the European elections. \"What's the point?\" Mr. Klein said.\n\nAfter 10 days on the road, my main takeaway was this: Europe cannot be taken for granted. But neither can its demise.\n\nAs Father Ragusa put it in Tuscany, Europe is a choice Europeans need to make over and over again.\n\nHe spoke of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor who was killed by the Nazis and had written about the role a toxic combination of economic hardship and ethnic hatred played in the rise of fascism. What he had written about Germany during its ascent could have been written today, Father Ragusa said.\n\nThe question Europe ultimately faces is the same, today as always, he said: \"What values do you want to follow? You have a responsibility to decide.\"\n\nChristopher F.

Leadsom and May were the two finalists in the 2016 contest to become the leader of the Conservative Party and the next British prime minister. Leadsom withdrew from that race after a controversial interview in which she suggested being a mother made her a better pick than May, who doesn't have children.\n\nBut she may be eyeing another run for No. 10. On Tuesday, Leadsom told LBC radio that she was \"actively considering\" and \"preparing\" for a leadership bid.\n\nShe would join a crowd of contenders from the Conservative Party who have indicated in interest in replacing May. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson is currenting leading in opinion polls.\n\nIn her resignation letter, Leadsom said she no longer believed May's approach to Brexit could \"deliver on the referendum result\" or ensure \"a truly sovereign United Kingdom.\"\n\nLeadsom said a second Brexit referendum would be \"dangerously divisive.\" May, too, has opposed a second referendum, but on Tuesday offered Parliament a chance to vote on whether there should be a second public vote.\n\nLeadsom added that tolerance for those in May's top leadership team \"who advocate policies contrary to the government's position had led to a complete breakdown of collective responsibility.\"\n\nA spokesman for Downing Street said May was \"disappointed\" that Leadsom had resigned, but added -- defiantly -- that the prime minister \"remains focused on delivering the Brexit people voted for.\"\n\nThere was much commotion on Wednesday over the possibility that May could be pushed out by lawmakers in her own party.\n\nOn Tuesday, May delivered what was potentially her last big sales pitch for her Brexit plan, urging lawmakers to pass a deal they've already rejected three times. May offered a few new tweaks, including the enticement of a vote on a second referendum. It went down like a lead balloon.\n\nConservative lawmakers, previously loyal, were suddenly popping up on telly or in newspapers saying that she had to go.\n\nTom Tugendhat, a Conservative lawmaker and chair of the foreign affairs committee, wrote in the Financial Times on Wednesday that \"leadership matters; it has been absent for too long.\" He said that May \"deserves respect\" but that a new leader was needed to \"inject fresh energy into a moribund process and rebuild the trust necessary to deliver a deal.\"\n\nBut May appeared to win a stay of execution, for a few days at least.\n\nRead more\n\nTheresa May offers Parliament a vote on a second Brexit referendum\n\nIn what may be Britain's last European election, Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party is expected to dominate\n\nChelsea Flower Show wows with a royal treehouse and climate change garden", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6XXX_klX-mEGtK6WWpILsSU1GZI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CHFNTXT42EI6TJNTGTZ634JVDY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4803960", "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 296254200}, {"uri": "1142849139", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "16:51:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T16:51:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5215686559677124, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/europe/brexit-theresa-may.html", "title": "Theresa May Faces Growing Calls to Quit Amid Fresh Brexit Revolt", "body": "With Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain facing yet another defeat in Parliament over her Brexit plans, her governing Conservative Party is now confronting a dilemma: Should they allow their wounded pilot to go down in flames or should they press the ejector button first?\n\nEither way, Mrs. May's turbulent time in Downing Street is entering its final stages by her own admission, wrecked by her failure to persuade Parliament to support her deal to leave the European Union.\n\nAs the Wednesday wore on, rumors swirled with increasing intensity of a cabinet revolt against Mrs. May, the day after her latest plan to resolve Brexit provoked a ferocious backlash from her own lawmakers.\n\nWith her leadership already on life support, Mrs. May's latest Brexit proposal, announced on Tuesday, was seen as her last chance to salvage some sort of legacy from her time in power by persuading Parliament to accept a variant on a blueprint it has already rejected three times.\n\nBut so negative was the reaction to her proposal that some lawmakers believe that putting it up for a vote would make matters worse, not better, because another crushing defeat would complicate life for her successor. Nigel Evans, a member of an influential committee of Conservative lawmakers, said that Mrs. May should \"make way for fresh leadership without handcuffing her successor to a poisoned baton.\"\n\nThroughout Wednesday, pressure mounted on Mrs. May to scrap the vote that she is still promising for the week beginning June 3, and to name the date of her departure immediately.\n\nMrs. May's ability to dig deep and survive any amount of political pain has been perhaps the defining feature of her period in power. On Wednesday, she defended her Brexit blueprint doggedly in Parliament as she has done so often before, even as she conceded that \"in time another prime minister will be standing at this dispatch box.\"\n\nBut the support a prime minister would normally expect was conspicuously absent, with many of Mrs. May's fellow Conservatives staying away from the chamber and leaving her to fend for herself. All the while around Parliament, an expanding crowd of hopefuls are lobbying Conservative lawmakers for support in the looming contest for her job.\n\nIn one last desperate act, Mrs. May has revamped a proposal that would keep Britain tied to Europe's main economic structures at least until the end of 2020, then take it out of the bloc's customs and trading system.\n\nBut constructing a revised deal that might gain the support of a wider coalition of lawmakers, including some from the opposition Labour Party, has put Mrs. May on a political tightrope.\n\nWith her revamped plan, Mrs. May aimed to win over Labour lawmakers by offering the opportunity to vote on whether to put any plan for Brexit to a second referendum. Lawmakers would also be allowed to vote on whether to keep Britain, temporarily, in a type of customs union with the European Union that would eliminate tariffs and many checks on goods at borders.\n\nBut while the Labour leadership rejected the concessions as insufficient, many of Mrs. May's pro-Brexit lawmakers were horrified, and several of those who had reluctantly supported the government in its last Brexit vote have said they would not do so again.\n\nAnother defeat would be particularly problematic since Mrs. May is not offering lawmakers a general vote on her deal but one on specific legislation to take Britain out of the bloc. Losing that would limit the options for a new prime minister, who would not be able to bring back the bill in the same parliamentary session.\n\nOn Wednesday, one Conservative lawmaker, Nicky Morgan, appealed to Mrs. May to reflect on whether to proceed with her Brexit vote, noting that the \"consequences of it not being passed are very serious.\"\n\nEarlier, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, gave an agile and evasive interview to the BBC in which he hinted that the bill might not come forward as planned -- without saying whether it would.\n\nThat question is connected to the timing of Mrs. May's departure.\n\nEarlier this year she promised to step down if lawmakers voted for her deal. Then, last week, she told senior Conservative lawmakers that, if her proposal was rejected again, she would set out a timetable for her successor to be chosen.\n\nConvincing her to withdraw the proposal would be an effective admission that she cannot win, and would seem to fulfill that condition -- giving lawmakers a way to send her packing without shouldering direct responsibility.\n\nThough Mrs. May now has only threadbare support -- at best -- from her cabinet, senior colleagues are divided into factions depending on their willingness to contemplate the huge economic risks of withdrawing from the European Union unilaterally. With little trust among them, cabinet ministers have struggled to maneuver against Mrs. May, and levering her out of Downing Street quickly is also complicated by the upcoming political calendar.\n\nLate on Sunday results will start coming in from European elections, in which opinion polls suggest the Conservatives will be humiliated. That would put Mrs. May under pressure to resign immediately. But Monday is a public holiday, and Parliament will be on vacation until June 4, when President Trump is scheduled to be in Britain on his state visit.\n\nIf she can survive this week, Mrs. May is likely to be able to continue until after the visit. But sooner or later, the time will come for her to lay down a timetable for the election of the next leader of the Conservative Party.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_castle@nytimes.com", "name": "Stephen Castle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/22/world/22brexit2/22brexit2-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4803960", "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 296239860}, {"uri": "1142795833", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "15:42:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T15:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/business/cars-brexit-europe-technology.html", "title": "What's Driving Automakers Out of Europe?", "body": "Blame has been cast on events like Brexit, but there are other changes that are reshaping the industry globally.\n\nAutomakers, in quick succession, have moved in recent weeks to end parts of their operations in Europe. Nissan is the latest: On Tuesday, it confirmed that it would cease assembling Infiniti cars at its plant in northeast England.\n\nThe moves, during Britain's wrenching debate over its departure from the European Union, known as Brexit, have raised the question: Is Brexit forcing the carmaking industry out of Britain?\n\nIt's not quite so simple. Traditional car manufacturers, in Britain and in Europe over all, have been buffeted by forces around the world, and they assess where they want to make the next model of a car every few years or so.\n\nAs automakers allocate resources, they have been balancing the need to respond to these changes with the justifications for producing cars in places like Britain.\n\nHere are some of the forces reshaping the industry.\n\nWho is moving?\n\nHonda said it would close its plant in Swindon, England, by 2021 and stop making one of its sedans in Turkey. The Swindon plant employs 3,500 and the Turkish plant about 1,100.\n\nNissan reversed an earlier decision by deciding to produce the next generation of its X-Trail sport utility vehicle in Japan instead of Sunderland, England. Its luxury brand, Infiniti, is withdrawing from Western Europe altogether.\n\nFord said in January that it would cut thousands of jobs across Europe.\n\nJaguar Land Rover announced in January that it would be cutting 4,500 people from its global work force; most of the cuts are expected to be in Britain.\n\nDyson, which is developing an electric car, moved its headquarters from Britain to Singapore the same month.\n\nGeneral Motors pulled out of Europe in 2017, selling the Opel and Vauxhall brands.\n\nRegulation of fossil fuels has tightened\n\nIn the wake of Volkswagen's diesel-cheating scandal in 2015, when it used software to trick emissions tests, awareness of the harmful effects of fossil fuels has prompted stricter regulation throughout the Continent.\n\nSome German cities are banning older diesel engines in an effort to reduce pollution in urban areas. London has initiated a levy on drivers of older diesel vehicles. Britain and France plan to phase out sales of new diesel and gasoline-powered cars by 2040.\n\nHow Volkswagen's 'Defeat Devices' Worked\n\nVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.\n\nIn the meantime, more governments, drivers and carmakers are pivoting to electric vehicles. Cars running on alternative fuels made up 6 percent of new car registrations last year in Europe, up from 4.8 percent in 2017, according to JATO, an auto industry research firm.\n\nNorway is aiming to sell only electric cars by 2025, while India is aiming to be all electric by 2030.\n\nCarmakers are racing to respond. Volkswagen said Tuesday that it intended to sell 22 million electric cars over the next 10 years, compared with its previous goal of 15 million, and that the company would aim to be carbon neutral by 2050.\n\nThe investments necessary for building electric cars have added to cost pressures for automakers that, in some cases, have struggled to turn a profit in Europe.\n\nIn justifying the closing of its Swindon factory, Honda said it wanted to focus on electrification. \"The significant challenges of electrification will see Honda revise its global manufacturing operations, and focus activity in regions where it expects to have high production volumes,\" the company said.\n\nChina is speeding ahead on electric cars\n\nAs carmakers channel billions of dollars into grabbing a portion of the electric car market, many are looking to China, which is the world's largest maker and seller of electric cars.\n\nChina wants one in every five cars sold to run on an alternative fuel by 2025, and officials have said the country will get rid of internal combustion engines in new cars altogether. The country's rules also require carmakers to sell more alternative-energy cars if they want to continue selling regular models.\n\nThis has prompted car companies to realign where they make and develop cars.\n\nTesla has opened a factory there. Volkswagen signed an agreement with the Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group last year to develop an electric vehicle. General Motors has made China the hub of its electric car research and development, while both Renault-Nissan and Ford have joint electric-car ventures in China.\n\nThe industry is getting more crowded\n\nIn their efforts to grab a share of the growing market for electric cars, traditional car companies are competing not just with each other but also against technology companies.\n\nUber, Alphabet and Tesla are channeling money into electric cars and autonomous cars, while reshaping the way people travel with ride-hailing services.\n\nThis has prompted rivals to team up, or to work with the technology companies, so that they are not left behind.\n\nFord and Volkswagen formed an alliance in January to share technology for electric and self-driving vehicles, and save money.\n\nBMW and Daimler announced in February that they would collectively invest 1 billion euros in a joint venture focused on offering services like car-sharing and electric charging points.\n\nAudi, BMW and Daimler have joined forces to buy a digital mapping company. Daimler has teamed up with Uber on autonomous vehicles.\n\nBMW is working with the chip maker Intel and Mobileye, an Israeli tech company, to develop a self-driving car. It is also in a partnership with IBM to use artificial intelligence to adapt vehicles to owners' preferences.\n\nFiat Chrysler is working with Google on self-driving cars, General Motors invested $500 million into Lyft, and Volvo provided the chassis for Uber's driverless car tests.\n\nThis shift has accelerated change and added to costs, said Peter Wells, a professor at the Center for Automotive Industry Research at the Cardiff Business School in Wales. And that has prompted companies to scrutinize whether they should maintain operations in markets that are not expected to grow and could become more difficult to serve.\n\n\"Companies around the world are having to re-evaluate their positions,\" Mr. Wells said.\n\nEuropean markets are sluggish\n\nThe European car market is not growing. Annual car sales there peaked in 2007 at about 16 million. They're at about 15 million now, according to JATO.\n\nIt is also a saturated market, dominated by European marques, and favors smaller cars. Carmakers hungry for profits generated by pickup trucks and S.U.V.s are looking elsewhere for growth. Sales of S.U.V.s in Europe are still far behind those in China and the United States.\n\nThe Italian-American company Fiat Chrysler said in February that it planned to expand its capacity in the United States by updating several plants. They will produce large Jeep models.\n\nCertainly, even promising regions face challenges. In the United States, many believe that car sales have peaked, forcing the idling of some factories. And the economic slowdown in China has sent car sales plummeting.\n\nBut in announcing its withdrawal from Western Europe, Infiniti said it intended to focus on its S.U.V. in North America and its new models in China.\n\nBrexit makes planning harder\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the uncertainty surrounding Britain's departure from the European Union has made it difficult for companies to plan ahead. Several car companies have said they will close their factories temporarily after the country leaves the bloc in order to adjust to the disruptions that could arise.\n\nThe fear is that Brexit could cause havoc with the carefully choreographed just-in-time production processes at assembly plants. In Britain, more than half of the components in cars come from the European Union, entering seamlessly on trucks from the Continent and arriving within minutes of being fitted in the final product.\n\nAfter Brexit, those trucks could face substantial delays if they must go through customs checkpoints. Without a clear sense of the terms of Britain's scheduled departure in a couple of weeks, making plans for production a few years down the line is more difficult.

He defined the phenomenon as a pileup of small tweaks to the existing regime, all ignored by the public, that taken together will undermine a system intended to prevent another devastating recession. After the current regulators have \"moved on,\" he said, \"somewhere down the line, someone else will suffer that damage. In all likelihood, it will once again be the most vulnerable of households and businesses.\"\n\nThe speech, delivered at Americans for Financial Reform in Washington, amounted to a rare rebuke of Tarullo's successors from the man the Wall Street Journal once called \"the most powerful man in banking,\" and Wall Streeters themselves nicknamed \"the Wizard of Oz\" for his quiet power over their industry. (Read the speech here.)\n\nAnd it comes a week after two former Fed chairs and two former Treasury secretaries sounded a warning about how Trump's Wall Street watchdogs are minding their beat. In a letter last Monday, the former Fed chairs, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, and the former treasury chiefs, Tim Geithner and Jack Lew, criticized the decision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to stop subjecting to extra oversight non-banks including major insurers and asset managers. \"Though framed as procedural changes, these amendments amount to a substantial weakening of the post-crisis reforms,\" they wrote.\n\n\"What's most notable here is just that all of these regulators collectively think that now is the time to speak out,\" says Jeremy Kress, an assistant professor of business law at the University of Michigan and a crisis-era attorney at the Fed. \"Between what's going on at the Fed and FSOC, all the crisis-era regulators have had enough. And while they've generally maintained a low profile since leaving office, they've decided to put their personas behind substantive and serious critiques of these deregulatory proposals.\"\n\nTarullo focused in particular on stress testing, the exercise designed to determine whether banks have enough reserve capital to survive an economic collapse. He said the tests offer too many advance clues to banks, a change made in the name of transparency that will in fact allow banks to \"find clever ways to reshape their assets\" so they can maintain lower levels of capital without actually trimming risk. Tarullo also said a Fed proposal to create a new \"stress capital buffer\" to prevent banks from depleting their capital cushion with dividend payments could allow them to take on more risk, since it would exclude one of two standards used to calculate a bank's exposure.\n\nKevin Fromer, president of the Financial Services Forum, which represents CEOs of eight of the largest banks, suggested Tarullo's concerns are unfounded, because the biggest firms have more than an adequate capital cushion. \"I don't think there's any question the overall level of capital in these institutions is obviously higher, and the stress tests have demonstrated repeatedly that these institutions are extremely well capitalized and capable of lending in an extreme economic downturn,\" he said.\n\nBut Marcus Stanley, policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, which advocates tougher regulation of the industry, said Tarullo's critique highlighted how changes to the stress tests raise doubts about their reliability to ensure banks remain sound. \"For someone who is the architect of this system to come out publicly and say this isn't fine-tuning, and it's undermining the system, is quite significant,\" he said.\n\nIan Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, says the former regulators worked long and hard on the post-crisis rules, so it's \"understandable\" they now want to be on record opposing efforts to dial them back. Plus, Katz notes the industry appears to be gaining some traction on Capitol Hill: In the House, 26 Republicans recently wrote financial regulators pushing for more deregulation.\n\nYet he said his conversations with investors in the industry indicate they are more concerned with those firms outside the scope of strict federal oversight.\n\n\"I've had discussions with people who believe that the regulators, particularly the Fed, are still paying close attention to things like leveraged lending. But in the markets, to the extent people are concerned, they're more concerned about whats going on outside the regulated banking sector.\"\n\n-- Theresa May: Let Parliament vote on second Brexit referendum. The Post's Karla Adams: \"British Prime Minister Theresa May urged British lawmakers on Tuesday to back her 'new' Brexit deal, which would include a binding vote by Parliament on whether to hold a second Brexit referendum. In a speech in London, May said lawmakers will have \"one last chance\" to deliver Brexit in a vote early next month. But, more accurately, it probably will be May's last chance. She has signaled that she will step down if her thrice-rejected divorce deal fails again in the House of Commons, as it is widely expected to do.\"\n\nThe speech got panned. Per The Guardian: \"The Labour leadership insisted it did not represent a meaningful change and hard Brexit-supporting Tories and the DUP indicated they had little or no intention of voting for it. The People's Vote campaign also dismissed May's offer of a vote on a second referendum.\n\n-- Trump team eyes Fed critic Judy Shelton. WSJ's Nick Timiraos: \"Economist Judy Shelton, a potential nominee to the Federal Reserve, said in an interview that she would bring a different perspective to the central bank and press for a change in how it sets interest rates. Ms. Shelton has been interviewed by White House officials for a nomination to the Fed's board of governors and served as an informal adviser to [Trump's] 2016 campaign. She wrote critically in the weeks before that election about how the Fed's low- rate policies were boosting wealthy investors and corporations at the expense of working Americans and retirees with fixed incomes. On Tuesday, Ms. Shelton said she is no longer concerned about such perils because she believes the administration's fiscal policies have boosted growth and productivity.\"\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\n-- Xi speaks in subtext: Chinese President Xi Jinping didn't mention his country's trade war on Tuesday, but his actions show that he is ready for the long haul.\n\nPerspective: Rare earth materials may not be such a trump card. CNN's James Griffiths explains: \"Despite their name, rare earths are not that rare... Unlike oil and other raw materials, the need for a large and constant supply of many rare earth materials is also less important. Many products which use rare earths only require tiny amounts -- they have been described as 'the vitamins of modern technology' -- and therefore it will take time for them to be impacted by tariffs. The US also maintains stockpiles of many key rare earth materials, not least those used in the defense industry.\"\n\n-- The Trump administration targeted Huawei after China talks went south. \"The Trump administration held off on blacklisting Huawei Technologies Co. out of concern the move could disrupt trade negotiations with China and only took action after the last round of talks hit an impasse, according to people familiar with the matter,\" Bloomberg's Jenny Leonard, Nick Wadhams, and Margaret Talev report.\n\n\"Timing of the U.S. action raised questions about whether [Trump] is punishing the company in part to gain a negotiating edge with Beijing in a deepening clash over trade. Talks between Beijing and Washington deadlocked this month as Trump accused China of backing out of a deal that was taking shape with U.S. officials, saying China reneged on an agreement to enshrine a wide range of reforms in law.\"\n\nFive more companies to the blacklist? Bloomberg's Jenny Leonard and Nick Wadhams: \"The U.S. is considering cutting off the flow of vital American technology to as many as five Chinese companies including Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co., widening the dragnet beyond Huawei to include world leaders in video surveillance.

Penney Co Inc in the first quarter and its net loss nearly doubled after the retailer exited its appliance and in-store furniture businesses, sending shares down more than 9% on Tuesday,\" Reuters's Melissa Fares and Uday Sampath Kumar report.\n\n\"Chief Executive Jill Soltau, on an earnings conference call, warned investors that Penney would likely take a further hit if [Trump] imposed additional tariffs on another $300 billion worth of imports from China.\"\n\n-- McCarthy blocked bipartisan bid to limit China's role in U.S. transit: \"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blocked a bipartisan attempt to limit Chinese companies from contracting with U.S. transit systems, a move that benefited a Chinese government-backed manufacturer with a plant in his district, according to multiple people familiar with the matter,\" my colleagues Damian Paletta and Eric Werner report.\n\n\"Lawmakers frequently take a stance on legislation that could affect campaign contributors or hometown companies.

As the European Union gears up for a crucial election, it is mostly homegrown groups rather than foreign powers that are taking to social media to push false information and extremist messages, experts say.\n\nAnd private and encrypted chat apps like WhatsApp are increasingly the favored platforms to spread false information, making it harder to monitor and fight.\n\nThere were worries that the bloc's May 23-26 vote for the EU parliament would be a ripe target for foreign meddling, given Russian interference in the 2016 ballot that brought U.S. President Donald Trump to power and allegations of disinformation -- plus a lack of solid facts -- surrounding Britain's Brexit referendum that same year.\n\nSo far, no spike has appeared on the 28-nation bloc's disinformation radars and tech companies say they haven't found signs of a coordinated operation by foreign actors. There is, though, a constant buzz of false information that mainly seeks to erode the EU's image and that has ground on since the last Europe-wide elections in 2014.\n\n\"Previous, it was broadly about Russia, fakery and looking for bots. Now what we see is the transnational Far Right deploying that digital toolkit, less fake news, more hate-speech, and a more complex set of tactics to amplify populist narratives,\" said Sasha Havlicek, CEO of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based left leaning think tank. \"That isn't to say that is there is no Russian activity but that it's harder to identify definitively.\"\n\nThe trend now is for populist and far right groups in Europe to \"manipulate information\" through more nuanced messages, to promote anti-migration, anti-gay and climate denial themes. This \"narrative warfare\" is much harder for governments and tech companies to react to, she said. Adding to the confusion, some world leaders have themselves been guilty of spreading false or misleading information on social media.\n\nOnline campaign group Avaaz said Wednesday it found 500 suspect Facebook pages and groups in Germany, Britain, France, Spain, Italy and Poland spreading fake news seen 533 million times in the past three months. Facebook has taken down 77 of the pages, some of which Avaaz had previously announced.\n\nOne of the pages taken down, supporting Italy's right-wing League party, had shared a video purporting to show African migrants smashing a police car that had racked up 10 million views. But it was actually a scene from a film and had been already debunked several times over the years, Avaaz said.\n\nChristoph Schott, campaign director at Avaaz, says that fake news is often amplified with \"bait and switch\" tactics like building up an audience for a page on a generic topic such as football or cooking, then ramping up political agendas.\n\nThe aim is to sow \"little seeds of distrust ... to slowly erode trust in institutions and divide people over a longer period of time,\" said Schott.\n\nFacebook said that after Avaaz shared its research, it removed a number of fake and duplicate accounts for violating its \"authenticity policies\" and took action against some pages that repeatedly posted misinformation.\n\nTech companies have stepped up broader efforts to fight fake news.\n\nFacebook has set up an EU election \"war room\" in Dublin, staffed by data scientists, researchers and threat intelligence specialists working with teams in California to monitor for abuse around the clock.\n\nFacebook's vice president for public policy in Europe, Richard Allan, said this month the company hasn't detected any major attacks.\n\n\"Part of that, we hope, is because we put in a lot of preventive measures,\" he said. \"We've gotten better at fake account detection and removal.\"\n\nTwitter, which launched a tool for EU users to report deliberately misleading election-related content, also says it hasn't seen any coordinated malicious activity.\n\nThe two social media companies, along with Google, have tightened up requirements for taking out political ads, including confirming identities of ad buyers. They're putting all political ads into publicly searchable databases, although researchers say they don't give a comprehensive view and the ads aren't always properly classified.\n\nThe nature of European elections may be a factor in behind why they haven't been targeted. For one thing, turnout is usually low. Around 42 percent of voters cast their ballots in 2014. Beyond that, Europe's citizens often use the EU elections to cast protest votes about issues of domestic concern.\n\nAround 400 million people in 28 countries are eligible to vote in the world's biggest transnational elections, choosing 751 representatives to the European Parliament, the EU's only democratically elected institution.\n\n\"The European elections are still basically 28 different national campaigns, fought mostly on national issues,\" said policy analyst Paul Butcher at the European Policy Centre think-tank. \"Each country has got its own political priorities; the campaigns will be quite different in different places.\"\n\nBut it could also be a matter of not looking in the right place. Oxford University researchers studying tweets related to the EU elections found that only a small fraction came from Russian or \"junk news\" sources while mainstream news stories dominated.\n\nHowever, some junk news stories can be several times more popular than those from professional media organizations, with the most successful centered on populist themes such as anti-immigration and Islamophobia while few attacked European leaders and parties or voiced skepticism about the EU, according to the researchers, who compiled about 585,000 tweets in seven European languages.\n\n\"Almost none of the junk we found circulating online came from known Russian sources,\" said Nahema Marchal, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. \"Instead, it is homegrown, hyper-partisan and alternative media that dominate.\"\n\nIt's also become harder to keep track of disinformation as more online conversations go private, said Clara Jim\u00e9nez Cruz, co-founder of Spanish fact-checking group Maldita.es.\n\nTwitter posts or public Facebook feeds are only part of the story, with many messages and discussions now moving to private Facebook groups or encrypted WhatsApp and Telegram chats, which EU and national governments can't easily monitor, she said.\n\nAvaaz said in a report that millions of potential Spanish voters were flooded with false, misleading, racist or hateful posts on WhatsApp ahead of national elections last month.\n\nOn WhatsApp, where it's so hard for outsiders to peer into private conversations to debunk lies, \"that is where we find most of the hoaxes,\" said Jim\u00e9nez. \"And especially where we find them first.\"\n\n___\n\nCook reported from Brussels and Parra reported from Madrid.

That's a bad sign for free trade.\n\nThe birds are being used in a food fight by populists in Europe who are poised to make significant gains in parliamentary elections this week. Such a shift in the makeup of the European Parliament would complicate the simmering trade conflict between the United States and Europe.\n\nChicken meat from the United States is routinely sterilized using a chlorinated wash, a method forbidden in the European Union. The American birds are banned and often cited, with some dread, as an all-purpose justification for putting up barriers to American products.\n\nThe Trump administration has tried to put the chickens back on the negotiating table, notably with Britain as it prepares to leave the European Union. European candidates, both on the left and on the right, have seized the cluckers as a way to dramatize the stakes in the balloting that runs from Thursday to Sunday.\n\nAmong the first candidates to bring up chickens was Yanis Varoufakis, a left-wing former finance minister of Greece who is running for a seat in Brussels. During an appearance in March, Mr. Varoufakis vowed to block multinational corporations that \"will want to introduce chlorinated chickens in Europe.\"\n\nMatteo Salvini, the leader of Italy's right-wing League party, did not directly mention the birds but invoked food anxiety last week, on the eve of a rally of 11 populist leaders from across Europe. \"In some agricultural sectors, I think of meat; for example, we ask for absolute rigor in the checking of the quality of the production and of the product,\" said Mr. Salvini, who is deputy prime minister and interior minister.\n\nFood accounts for less than 3 percent of the $1.3 trillion in trade between the United States and Europe, far behind products like chemicals, pharmaceuticals, vehicles or machinery. But farmers are among the most powerful political lobbies on both sides of the Atlantic, and trade is one area where the European Parliament wields significant power.\n\nPopulist parties like Mr. Varoufakis's Pan-European DiEM25 or the right-wing coalition led by Mr. Salvini are expected to win enough support to deny the two main centrist parties a majority in the European Parliament, according to estimates by Teneo, a management consultant. The centrist parties -- the conservative European People's Party and the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats -- would have to cooperate with parties like the Greens, who are skeptical of trade deals with the United States.\n\n\"The rightist parties will play a bigger role. The Greens will play a bigger role,\" said Peter Balas, a former Hungarian diplomat who is a senior policy adviser at Covington, a law firm. \"It will be much more difficult in the Parliament to have a cohesive approach to trade.\"\n\nFood may be the least of their problems.\n\nEuropean manufacturers have been on edge for months only to see President Trump put off a decision on imposing tariffs on cars imported from Europe, Japan and South Korea. The delay, for six months, averted a sharp escalation of trade tensions. It brought some relief to European leaders who feared the effect of car tariffs on wobbly economies.\n\nBut six months is not a long time to negotiate a trade deal. Mr. Trump, who has often accused Europe of taking advantage of the United States, could easily revive the threat of car tariffs if he believes the Europeans are refusing to make concessions.\n\nEuropean and American negotiators have continued to meet behind the scenes even as China has attracted most of the attention. On Wednesday, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the European trade commissioner, and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, were scheduled to meet in Paris, where both were attending meetings of members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \"The E.U. is ready to start negotiations for a limited trade agreement,\" a European Commission spokeswoman said.\n\nThe European Commission has limited room to maneuver. In April, France and Belgium balked at joining the talks because the Trump administration refused, in 2017, to sign a global pact on climate change. All 28 European Union states agreed that agriculture products should not be reconsidered, and Congress may not approve a deal that does not help American farmers.\n\nAt campaign stops, candidates are trying to rally emotions and votes around food. Their speechifying takes some skill because that trade is lopsided in favor of Europe. The European Union sold $10.4 billion more goods like wine and cheese to the United States last year than it bought.\n\nFor example, Wisconsin cheese producers are not allowed to sell their Parmesan or feta in Europe. The names are restricted for use from regions in Italy and Greece that traditionally produce them.\n\n\"Europeans can sell their Asiago, Parmesan, feta, etc., in Wisconsin, but cheesemakers like me are blocked from selling Wisconsin cheeses by the same names in Europe,\" Errico Auricchio, president of BelGioioso Cheese, said this month. Mr. Auricchio heads the Consortium for Common Food Names, a lobbying alliance that has asked Mr. Trump to ban imports of food products that Americans cannot sell in Europe.\n\nMost parties in the race for Brussels say they favor free trade but outline conditions -- such as fighting climate change -- that run counter to White House policies.\n\nRight-wing politicians do not have a unified position on trade, but there is a strong protectionist faction. At the populist rally in Milan on Saturday, Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Rally party of France, drew applause with her call: \"We reject uncontrolled free trade that helps only the banks and financiers.\" Ms. Le Pen has routinely equated food with national identity and has promised to protect farmers.\n\nIn a campaign appearance this month, Mr. Salvini spoke about foreign food with the derisive tone he uses to denigrate immigrants.\n\n\"If you give us a hand choosing the League in the European elections on May 26,\" he said, \"we will go to Brussels and bring back Italian farming, which has been massacred in recent years by Canadian grain, Cambodian rice, Moroccan tomatoes, Tunisian oranges, olive oil from the other part of the world.\"\n\nChlorinated chickens have been a sore point since the 1960s. When Europe banned American chickens at the time, the United States retaliated by imposing 25 percent tariffs on European trucks and vans. The European Union food safety agency has concluded that a widely used method for treating chickens with a chloride solution poses \"no safety concerns for humans.\" But the ban on American poultry is still in place, as are truck tariffs, an indication of how intractable trade disputes can be.\n\nThe United States and Europe have fewer problems with each other than each has with China. The United States' trade deficit with Europe is less than one-third that of its deficit with China, even though total trade is much larger. Trade with China totaled $737 billion in 2018, compared with $1.3 trillion with Europe. But the United States had a $379 billion trade deficit with China, compared with a $109 billion deficit with Europe.\n\nThe United States has not accused Europe of wholesale theft of intellectual property, as it has China. Europe does not force American investors to work with local joint venture partners, as China does with any foreign entity. European companies are not accused of hollowing out the American industrial heartland, as is the case with Chinese competitors.\n\nStill, expectations are low. There is some hope that the United States and Europe can work out agreements in pharmaceuticals, a category worth almost $100 billion in two-way trade, far more than food. Most business groups are simply hoping relations do not deteriorate.\n\n\"What we want at the moment is to maintain the status quo,\" said Luisa Santos, director for international relations at BusinessEurope, a leading business group.\n\nOne thing seems certain.\n\n\"Les poulets au chlore ne passeront pas,\" the French weekly Lib\u00e9ration wrote this year in an editorial, albeit with a heavy dose of irony. \"The chlorinated chickens shall not pass.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_ewing@nytimes.com", "name": "Jack Ewing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/20/business/00euvotetrade-1/00euvotetrade-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 296217180}, {"uri": "1142300488", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "10:12:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T10:12:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/05/22/globalism-is-under-siege-heres-how-save-it-why/", "title": "Perspective | Globalism is under siege.

(Lisi Niesner/Reuters) By JoAnne Yates and Craig N. Murphy May 22 at 6:00 AM\n\nOver the past few years, world politics have been governed by a backlash against globalization. From the Brexit mess in Britain to restrictive immigration policies and tariffs in the United States and elsewhere, global economic integration is under assault.\n\nBut such integration offers many benefits: a greater variety of less expensive goods, greater opportunities for travel and cultural exchange, a more cosmopolitan world. In this climate, nongovernmental entities may be crucial to preserving them.\n\nThankfully, engineers have spent the past century building just such international bodies, because they believed that economic integration must remain above politics. These organizations have long set voluntary standards to ensure integration even when the political winds blow against them. This conception of global business standards will be crucial in the years to come as we struggle to preserve the benefits of cohesive systems for international trade, even as politicians battle over how interconnected they want to be.\n\nIt is ironic that the British should find themselves in the Brexit mess, because it was British engineers who created the first of the national standards bodies. Their project, a forerunner of today's British Standards Institution (BSI), was a product of the expansive British Empire. It was founded in 1901 to ensure that industrial products and transportation networks within the United Kingdom and across its empire would be compatible with one another. Although some government representatives were included in its processes, the engineers leading the effort believed such standards should be voluntary, not government-mandated.\n\nAs such, they needed to build buy-in from companies through persuasion, not coercion. They established technical committees of experts representing both producers and users of a particular product -- such as steel companies and railroads on committees to discuss steel rails for railroad tracks -- as well as engineers unaffiliated with either side to represent the common interest. This balance prevented any one set of stakeholders from dominating the process and, while time-consuming, assured that all positions were heard and considered so the resulting standards would be widely adopted.\n\nThe British model was copied by other national bodies in subsequent decades, thanks in part to the evangelism of Charles le Maistre, the long-serving secretary of BSI. Le Maistre successfully encouraged engineers in France, the United States, the Soviet Union, Sweden and a half-dozen other countries to follow the British example.\n\nBut national standard bodies weren't enough for British electrical engineers and industrialists, including le Maistre. They also promoted the first private, sector-based international standards organization, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), created in 1906 and still active today. IEC's standards expanded the market for electrical products and system components such as turbines and transformers by assuring compatibility and lowering prices (since standardized items can be made in larger, cost-saving batches). This made it possible to establish Europe's high-voltage electrical grid.\n\nLe Maistre would serve as secretary of this organization for close to a half-century. Late in his life, he also helped found the post-World War II global standard-setting body, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n\nIEC and ISO have been the center of a global network ever since. In the aftermath of World War II, the vision of the activists in the international community of standard setters, and their belief that such standards were too important to be distorted by politics, allowed these organizations to navigate the minefield of the war's victors and vanquished, as well as the divisive politics of the nascent Cold War.\n\nAlthough standard setters from the victorious countries and some of the neutrals originally formed ISO, le Maistre and other leaders used personal diplomacy to bring the defeated countries into the organization, several years before they were accepted into the United Nations. They also worked hard to keep the Soviet Union and other Eastern bloc countries in the international standards bodies throughout the Cold War.\n\nDuring the postwar decades, a regional standards organization also arose in Europe. Olle Sturen, a Swedish engineer and standard setter, worried that the new European Economic Community, from which the European Union (E.U.) grew, would exclude Swedish industrial products from the lucrative markets of Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium. As a result, Sturen worked with British and German engineers to create a private industrial standardization body for all of Europe: CEN.\n\nThe European Economic Community would maintain tariffs on some goods from Sweden, the United Kingdom and other countries outside the agreement, but CEN assured that across the continent, industrial products, along with the increasingly complex transportation systems that moved goods from one country to the next, would be technically compatible, eliminating many nontariff barriers to trade. These technical committees worked for years to reach consensus on everything from the size and shape of screws to the characteristics of shipping pallets and truck bodies. The standards they developed were voluntary, but they were usually widely adopted simply because all the key stakeholders had been at the table.\n\nWhen Sturen became secretary general of ISO in the late 1960s, a position he held through the mid-1980s, he pursued two major goals: speeding up the establishment of international standards and expanding the standards community worldwide. One of his priorities was setting global standards for intermodal shipping containers, which helped transform global trade. Those big metal boxes stacked up on the world's largest ships, then transferred to railroad cars or trucks to reach their final destinations, bring us most consumer goods and make possible today's global supply chains.\n\nSome economists believe that the cost savings generated by container standardization have had more impact on the massive increase in global trade than anything the World Trade Organization (WTO) has done. Sturen's other early priorities -- standards for connecting computers and for dealing with atmospheric pollution -- have also had a significant impact on global economic integration.\n\nTo expand the world standards community, Sturen encouraged formation of national standards bodies in developing countries so they could join in international standard setting. His efforts reflected a fervent belief that standard-setting must transcend politics -- whether around Brexit, the WTO or other national or international political issues -- and that it is just as important. This could prove pivotal as international trade and global connectedness comes under attack.\n\nCEN standards and the rules that govern them are sticky enough that Brexit, for example, probably will not undo them if it eventually takes place. In February 2018, before the British Parliament got down to serious discussion of what Brexit would really mean, BSI declared that it could and should remain a full member of European standards bodies. After all, those bodies are European (not just E.U.) organizations, and BSI can remain a member as long as it agrees that, when a European standard is developed, BSI will adopt it as a British national standard. While some hardcore Brexiteers might object, the standardizers believe that the U.K. should stay focused on European and global standards and the markets they support, whether or not they leave the E.U.\n\nBSI recognizes that consumers worldwide, including those in the U.K., have benefited from international standards because they have been key to expanding global markets. And standard-setting organizations will be crucial in maintaining the benefits of a global market, especially as politicians posture and threaten. These efforts will benefit citizens around the globe through lower prices and faster shipping.\n\nInternational standards bodies did so long before governments embraced globalization, and they'll keep doing so even if governments foolishly reject such interconnectedness today.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3HWUVU8t_pPN5VCvain-je0F4cs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5SLU3YD3EMI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 296215920}, {"uri": "1142236321", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "09:37:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T09:37:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8235294222831726, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/whats-at-stake-in-this-weeks-european-elections/2019/05/21/8da30b50-7b17-11e9-b1f3-b233fe5811ef_story.html", "title": "What's at stake in this week's European elections?", "body": "From left, politicians Geert Wilders of the Netherlands, Matteo Salvini of Italy, J\u00f6rg Meuthen of Germany, Marine Le Pen of France, Vaselin Marehki of Bulgaria, Jaak Madison of Estonia and Tomio Okamura of the Czech Republic attend a rally in Milan on May 18. (Luca Bruno/Associated Press) By Michael Birnbaum and Michael Birnbaum Brussels bureau chief covering Europe Griff Witte Griff Witte Europe-focused correspondent with extensive experience in the Middle East and South Asia May 22 at 5:00 AM\n\nBRUSSELS -- Europe's far-right nationalists will have a chance to expand their power in elections for European Parliament that begin Thursday, as they seek a breakthrough that could thwart the workings of the European Union and jolt capitals across the continent.\n\nThe once-every-five-years vote is the biggest exercise of democracy in the world outside India, giving the half-billion citizens of the 28 E.U. nations a chance to elect representatives to the European legislature.\n\nSince the last election in 2014, the European Union has been hammered by a refugee crisis, multiple mass-casualty terrorist attacks, a vote by the British people to exit the bloc, a security scare fueled by the Kremlin and a fitful economic recovery following the global financial crisis.\n\nMore so than in previous years, voters will be making fundamental choices about the trajectory of the E.U. The shades-of-gray options that have dominated past votes are giving way to stark decisions over the nature of Europe's union -- or whether there should be a union at all.\n\nAlthough far-right and other parties that are hostile toward the E.U. have been on the ballot for decades, they have never wielded so much influence or appeared poised to control such a substantial share of the 751 seats.\n\n\"We are ready to say today that the day of glory has arrived,\" French far-right leader Marine Le Pen declared Saturday at a raucous rally in Milan, where she appeared onstage alongside anti-immigration leaders from across the continent. \"We say no to this immigration that is submerging our countries and that endangers the security of our peoples, our resources and our civilizational values.\"\n\n[Europe's far right says it is united. But can ultranationalists find a way to work across borders?]\n\nFrom grand palazzi in Rome to art nouveau villas in Budapest, Europe's anti-migration right-wingers have been prepping their battering rams to knock down the doors of the European Parliament. No one expects them to win a majority, but their aim is less to legislate than to obstruct.\n\n\"This election is crucial for the future of Europe and the European Union,\" said David McAllister, a center-right German lawmaker who is the head of the foreign affairs committee in the European Parliament. \"The nationalists, the populists and the demagogues want to destroy European cooperation.\"\n\nThe traditional center-left and center-right parties -- already struggling last time around -- are expected to lose ground to parties further out on the political spectrum.\n\n\"The most important question in the European election is not right versus left -- the old, traditional ideological cleavage,\" said Peter Kreko, executive director of the Budapest-based Political Capital Institute. \"It's much more important what the mainstream-versus-extreme ratio looks like.\"\n\nAnd that ratio appears poised to change significantly, though not radically, as the vote rolls across Europe through the weekend. Most E.U. countries vote Sunday.\n\nThe biggest shift, according to poll-based forecasts, is that the center-right and center-left political families that have held sway in Brussels are likely to lose their combined majority. The latest projections show them falling from 53 percent of the vote to 42.\n\nTo continue to govern as a grand, across-the-aisle coalition -- as they do now -- they will need additional partners.\n\nNationalist and other far-right parties, meanwhile, are expected to rise from about one-fifth of the seats to a quarter. Others, including pro-business and environmentalist parties, are also expected to gain.\n\nThe European Parliament has long been a feeding ground, paradoxically, for Euroskeptic politicians. Until recently, few European citizens paid the legislature much attention. Election day turnout is often far lower than for national votes, favoring the passionate extremes who can mobilize their base. And once in office, lawmakers can use generous allowances to bolster their brand and their domestic legitimacy.\n\nThe body's powers are not sexy. It can't directly propose legislation, only approve reforms -- such as the data privacy overhaul that went into effect last year. National leaders keep major powers around security and foreign policy for themselves. Still, the European Parliament needs to sign off on senior E.U. leaders and the E.U. budget.\n\nThis year's shifts in representation may be relatively modest, but they could have a disproportionate impact on how the E.U. functions, putting the far right in good position to play spoiler.\n\n\"Even with a relatively small percentage of the vote, the potential to delegitimize the European Parliament is quite strong,\" said Almut M\u00f6ller, co-head of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"Brussels is used to operating according to the Brussels consensus. Now the picture will be different.\"\n\nA legislature with less ability to get things done would feed the narrative of the E.U.'s nationalist critics, who argue that the bloc is fundamentally broken. The chaos unleashed by Brexit has calmed demands in other countries to quit the E.U. altogether, but Euroskeptic leaders still want to chop away at its powers and rebuild barriers between countries.\n\n[Frexit? Italeave? After watching Brexit, other European countries say: No, thanks.]\n\n\"If your goal is destroying the E.U., then stagnation is a pretty good thing,\" said Marietje Schaake, a centrist Dutch member of the European Parliament.\n\nIn order for Europe's critics to wield maximum influence, they will need to work together -- something they have failed to do so far.\n\nThe far right is now distributed across three separate blocs in the European Parliament, with both personal and policy differences standing in the way of a confederacy of nationalists. One divide is on Russia, since Western Europe's far right tends to admire the Kremlin while its Eastern European compatriots can be suspicious of Moscow.\n\nAlso stalling the far right's march are signs that, at least in some places, its moment may be passing.\n\nWhile nationalists are unquestionably more popular now than they were during the last vote, in 2014, their support in many countries has leveled off as the memory of the 2015-2016 refugee crisis recedes.\n\nIn Germany, for instance, the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD) is forecast to nearly double its share of the vote from the last E.U. election, when the party was a newcomer protesting Greek bailouts.\n\nBut recent polls show it hasn't gained support since the 12.6 percent it won in Germany's 2017 federal election, and may have even lost a bit.\n\n\"These elections are part of the great shift in politics -- they're a move away from the old normal, but we aren't there yet,\" said Heather Grabbe, the director of the Open Society European Policy Institute. \"What you see across Europe is people moving out of mainstream parties to alternative parties.\"\n\nAnother X-factor for the far right will be fallout from Austria, where the government collapsed in spectacular fashion on Monday after a video revealed the leader of the country's premier far-right party apparently willing to engage in corrupt deals with Russians.\n\nThe scandal doomed a coalition between the center right and the far right that some in both camps had touted as an alternative future for Europe beyond the cozy left-right coalitions that have dominated in Brussels.\n\nBritain's participation in the election may provide a shot of sugar for Euroskeptics, with Nigel Farage's Brexit Party set for a good showing on Thursday. But those lawmakers will leave the European Parliament whenever Britain finally manages to quit the bloc.\n\n[In what may be Britain's last European election, Farage's new Brexit Party is expected to dominate]\n\nIn France, President Emmanuel Macron has framed the election as a chance to move toward a more integrated Europe, but one that better responds to the insecurities that have fueled nationalist movements.

Salvini then declared \"the extremists are in Brussels,\" the home of EU institutions, for wanting to retain the status quo.\n\n\"We need to do everything that is right to free this country, this continent, from the illegal occupation organized by Brussels,\" Salvini said.\n\nTAKING FROM THE TRUMP PLAYBOOK\n\nEurope's far-right and nationalist parties hope to emulate what President Donald Trump did in the 2016 U.S. election and what Brexiteers achieved in the U.K. referendum to leave the EU. That is to disrupt the powers that be, rail against what they see as an out-of-touch elite and warn against migrants massing at Europe's borders ready to rob the continent of its jobs and culture.\n\nStanding with Salvini, Le Pen promised the far-right \"will perform a historic feat,\" saying they could end up as high as the second-biggest political group in the EU parliament.\n\nPredictions show that is still extremely ambitious. Projections released by the European Parliament this month show the center-right European People's Party bloc losing 37 of its 217 seats and the center-left S&D group dropping from 186 seats to 149.\n\nAs for the far-right and nationalists, the Europe of Nations and Freedom group is predicted to win 62 seats, compared to 37 currently. Such statistics though could be irrelevant as soon as Monday if national parties start shifting to other EU-wide political groups in the 751-seat European legislature which meets both in Brussels and France's Strasbourg.\n\nOrban's nationalist Fidesz party is now in the EPP's ranks, but has been suspended for its anti-EU stance and virulent anti-migration rhetoric. The Hungarian prime minister might well bolt after the election to a new radical-right group, perhaps to be formed by Salvini, Le Pen and other nationalist leaders.\n\nWAR, TAXES, UNEMPLOYMENT\n\nFor many among the EU's half billion citizens, the memories of war have vanished and the EU's role in helping to keep the peace for 75 years, a feat for which it won the Nobel Prize, is overlooked.\n\nYet Europe was body-slammed by the financial crisis a decade ago and struggled through a yearslong debt crisis that saw nations like Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus get bailouts and produced recessions that slashed the incomes of millions.\n\nEurope's high taxes, stagnant wages and gap between rich and poor are still a sore point, highlighted now by weekly protests by France's yellow vest movement demanding more help for hard-pressed workers. EU nations have also not been able to forge a common approach to migration, fueling inter-bloc tensions, and its impotence in quickly containing a migrant influx in 2015 has propelled a surge of support for far-right and nationalist parties.\n\n\"We have a crisis of the European Union. This is a matter of fact,\" Macron acknowledged.\n\nExperts say he's right.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who fear that things potentially are moving in the wrong direction or already have moved in the wrong direction,\" said Janis Emmanouilidis at the European Policy Centre think-tank in Brussels. \"It is a mix of multiple insecurities which, at the end of the day, is pushing people toward those who are coming up with easy answers.\"\n\nTURNING INTO A POTENT FORCE\n\nSince the first European Parliament election in 1979, the legislature has slowly changed from a toothless organization where over-the-hill politicians got cushy pre-retirement jobs to a potent force with real decision-making powers.\n\nThe EU at first primarily regulated farming but now sets international trade policy for all members and even monetary rules for the 19 nations who use the shared euro currency.\n\nThe legislature itself affects Europeans' daily lives in thousands of ways: cutting smartphone roaming charges, imposing safety and health rules for industries ranging from chemicals and energy to autos and food, supporting farming, reforming copyright rules and protecting the environment.\n\nThere are no cross-border elections this week, just national polls in 28 nations. Each EU nation gets a number of seats in the EU parliament based on its population. Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta have the fewest seats with six each, while the EU's most populous member, Germany, has 96 seats.\n\nUp until now, EU elections were tepid affairs. Voter turnout slumped to just 42.6% in 2014 -- but that could well change this year.\n\nWHICH WAY FORWARD?\n\nThe pro-EU side says increasing integration is essential for the EU to survive in a globalized world. Euroskeptics say it robs national identity whenever more decisions are made at EU headquarters in Brussels.\n\nYet even some mainstream conservatives can have a euroskeptic streak. Czech politician Jan Zahradil, lead candidate for the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists, is among those seeking to return more control to Europe's national capitals.\n\n\"(We want) an EU that is scaled back, that is flexible, that is decentralized,\" Zahradil said. \"(An EU) that respects national governments and that cooperates with them, that doesn't fight them, that doesn't patronize them, that doesn't lecture them.\"\n\nFor the pro-EU side, in a world in which China, the U.S. and Russia are all flexing their political and financial muscles, Macron urges voters to think about the strength and unity that comes from 28 smaller nations working together.\n\n\"If you fragment Europe, there is no chance you have a stronger Europe. Unity makes strength,\" Macron said.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels, Angela Charlton in Paris, Elena Becatoros in Athens and Colleen Barry in Milan contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more news from The Associated Press on the European Parliament elections go to https://www.apnews.com/EuropeanParliament\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

No Problem. The Patchwork Brexit Party Is Crushing Its Opponents.", "body": "WILLENHALL, England -- The candidates walked down the ballroom aisle to loud ovations and corporate rock, taking turns at the lectern delivering pitches for the Brexit Party: a deep-pocketed Tory known for churning through managers at his soccer club; an ex-Labour voter and son of a coal miner whose hometown despised Margaret Thatcher; a dental surgeon who said she believed the European Union was indoctrinating children \"like Stalin's kids and Komsomol and Hitler Youth.\"\n\nOne by one they let loose with a bare-bones populism largely bereft of any demonstrable political ideology or, for that matter, any detectable policies save one -- taking Britain out of the European Union promptly, and if necessary with no deal.\n\nBut by cloaking its message in the language of democracy and disgust with the political elite, the party -- formed just four months ago -- is threatening to become not just a vessel for discontent with Brexit, but also a more permanent pain to Britain's two main parties, the Conservatives and the opposition Labour. Just how successful it will be is one of the towering political questions for the coming year.\n\nRight now it is on a roll, expected to cruise to a strong first-place finish in elections to the European Parliament this week, even as smaller pro-Remain parties also pick off voters from the main parties.\n\nAs Brexit chainsaws its way through British politics, dismantling decades-old political allegiances, tearing apart the traditional parties and leaving voters confused, frustrated and angry, the Brexit Party is thriving by offering a simple and hard-edge message.\n\n\"People feel completely betrayed, they feel abandoned, they feel even hated and despised by the political class and also by the media,\" said Martin Daubney, the lifelong Labour voter now standing for the Brexit Party, who used to edit a raunchy men's magazine before reinventing himself as an anti-pornography advocate. \"It feels like a grass-roots political revolution on the streets of Britain right now.\"\n\nThe party's frontman, Nigel Farage, is hoping a big win in the European elections will provide a reaffirmation of the public will to leave the European Union. But it is far more complicated than that. The European elections, typically low-turnout affairs dominated by the most ideologically motivated voters, are an imperfect barometer.\n\nIn March, moreover, hundreds of thousands of people flooded London's streets in a rally for a people's vote on Brexit, making a strong statement about grass-roots sentiment against leaving the European Union, and some polls have shown a tentative shift in public sentiment toward remaining in the bloc. The centrist Liberal Democrats have inched ahead of Labour in some European election polls on the back of an unapologetically anti-Brexit message. And there has never been a majority for a no-deal Brexit in Parliament.\n\nBut Mr. Farage is thinking big, vowing to run candidates, including himself, in any coming domestic general election. And the party's success this week will surely become leverage for ardent Brexiteers already eager to replace Prime Minister Theresa May with someone who supports a no-deal Brexit.\n\nYet if politics can sometimes make odd bedfellows, the Brexit Party is taking that principle to the extreme, running candidates from all over the political spectrum. The party has even recruited as candidates three former members of the Revolutionary Communist Party and its successor groups, which defended deadly bombings by the Irish Republican Army in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nMr. Farage has defended his heterodox candidate slate as the seed of a nonpartisan pro-democracy movement. Analysts are dubious, however, saying he is more likely looking for ways to lure disaffected pro-Brexit Labour voters and provide a counterbalance to his history in the anti-immigration, largely right-wing 2016 Leave campaign.\n\n\"It's rational party competition,\" said Alan Wager, a research associate at the U.K. in a Changing Europe, a research institute. \"It's wearing the clothing of idealism and optimism, but it's not an optimistic or idealistic message really.\"\n\nJohn Malcolm, 75, a lifelong Conservative voter sitting beside his wife, seemed to speak for many in the crowd in Willenhall when he said he did not terribly much care whom the Brexit Party would send to Brussels.\n\n\"I wasn't looking for someone to represent me in Europe,\" he said. \"I'm looking for this party to do extremely well to show what we think on this issue to the other parties.\"\n\nVoters have used the European elections for protest votes before, but the Brexit Party, born in the wreckage of Mrs. May's deal, is unusually empty of formal policies. Its candidates rarely venture beyond its signature issue and populist themes, leaning on phrases like a \"clean Brexit\" but mostly dodging questions about what that means -- what arrangements they would make for Britain's borders, its airlines or its financial services industry, for example.\n\nOn the stage in Willenhall last week, there was hardly even much talk about why Britain was leaving the European Union in the first place. Immigration, the fuel of the 2016 Leave campaign, largely went unmentioned, a casualty of softening voter attitudes and fears about being accused of racism.\n\nInstead, the crowd roared at attacks on civil servants, Brussels bureaucrats, lawmakers and journalists. (The party banned Channel 4 News from its events after it broadcast an investigation into Mr. Farage's finances.)\n\nMr. Daubney, the Brexit Party candidate, slammed a leader of the campaign for a second Brexit referendum for putting stock in what people said at dinner parties, instead of at the chip shops and pubs where, Mr. Daubney said, \"I hang out with real people.\" Mr. Farage whipped up the crowd with talk of the \"treachery, duplicity of all of our political leaders\" and Britain's humiliation as a country of \"lions led by donkeys.\"\n\nThe party is experimenting internally with forms of direct democracy, planning what Mr. Daubney described as an online forum where supporters could weigh in on party policy. Italy's anti-establishment Five Star Movement runs a similar platform.\n\nUnlike Britain's main parties, whose leaders have to answer to a vast membership and various interest groups, the Brexit Party is effectively controlled by Mr. Farage. Its secrecy has generated concerns about foreign and untraceable donations to the party's PayPal, and the Electoral Commission, which regulates party finances, responded on Tuesday by reviewing its fund-raising systems, though it said it had \"not seen evidence of electoral offenses.\" Brexit Party officials have described the accusations as a \"disgusting smear\" and denied taking illegal foreign funds.\n\nMore concerning to some analysts is how the party is becoming a personal vehicle for Mr. Farage. \"It's new in the sense that politics is about the choice between policies and personalities, whereas Nigel Farage is obviously creating new rules,\" said Mr. Wager, the research associate. \"The no-policies, the way the organization is all dominated by him, is starting to look very autocratic.\"\n\nThe 1,200-person crowd in Willenhall -- mostly, but not entirely, conforming to polls showing the party relying on older voters -- did not want to be voting in the first place, given that Britain was supposed to have left the European Union in March. But they were all too happy to unload on politicians, calling out \"traitor!\" and \"coward!\"\n\nThe heavy turnout, in a town once dominated by lock and key makers and held for decades by Labour, reflected a turn in British politics from divisions over class lines to those over values like liberalism and authoritarianism, said Paula Surridge, a senior lecturer at the University of Bristol who has studied the shift.\n\nMr. Daubney said Labour had started focusing too much on racism and sexism, which he said had led to policies that \"tend to disfavor the bulk of the electorate, who are white people.\"\n\nThe Brexit Party's success beyond the European elections is by no means assured. The Conservative Party could well dump Mrs. May and turn to an arch-Brexiteer like Boris Johnson, the former foreign minister who was a leading Leave campaigner in the 2016 referendum, as party leader to woo back Tories who defected to Mr. Farage.\n\nThat would be a reprise of Mr. Farage's role leading up to 2016 as leader of the U.K. Independence Party, when he startled the Conservative government into calling the Brexit referendum in the first place.\n\nEven failing that, there is a natural tendency for voters to return to their traditional parties in general elections. On the other hand, Brexit could spell an end to such norms, staying resonant enough that the Brexit Party splits the right-wing electorate and allows the Labour Party to form a government under Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n\"The question is: Is this different because of it being about Brexit?\" said Rob Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester. \"We don't know the answer for certain.\"\n\nIn the audience in Willenhall, some voters said they had backed Mr. Farage as leader of the U.K. Independence Party in the last European elections, then switched their votes to Mrs. May after she promised to take Britain out of Europe's main economic institutions. But never again.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what happens from now on, I will never ever stick a cross in the Tory box ever again,\" said Andrew Kirby, 44, sitting beside his father. \"There's nothing that could happen. If the Brexit Party doesn't come to anything, I shall never vote again.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_mueller@nytimes.com", "name": "Benjamin Mueller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/21/world/21brexitparty1/21brexitparty1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800134", "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 296201700}, {"uri": "1141777197", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "20:55:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T20:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/books/review/upheaval-jared-diamond.html", "title": "What to Do When You're a Country in Crisis", "body": "When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\n\nUPHEAVAL\n\nTurning Points for Nations in Crisis\n\nBy Jared Diamond\n\nIf you've ever been at a wedding or conference or on board a United connection from O'Hare, and been cornered by a man with Theories About It All, and you came away thinking, \"That was a great experience,\" have I got the book for you.\n\nJared Diamond's \"Upheaval\" belongs to the genre of 30,000-foot books, which sell an explanation of everything. I travel often and see them a lot: at airport bookstores, where Steven Pinker and Yuval Noah Harari (both of whom blurbed \"Upheaval\") and Diamond, of course, deserve permanent shelves; and in the air, where I've noticed that a pretty disproportionate fraction of readers who read in the quiet of 30,000 feet have a preference for writers who write from the viewpoint of 30,000 feet.\n\nSo I dug into Diamond's latest, intrigued by his thesis that the way individual humans cope with crisis might teach something to countries. Then, before long, the first mistake caught my eye; soon, the 10th. Then graver ones. Errors, along with generalizations, blind spots and oversights, that called into question the choice to publish. I began to wonder why we give some people, and only some, the platform, and burden, to theorize about everything.\n\nThe theory proposed by Diamond -- a professor of geography at the University of California at Los Angeles and the author of several books, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Guns, Germs and Steel\" -- is interesting. Human beings go through personal crises all the time. We know a lot about how people change in order to cope -- or fail to. What if we applied those lessons to countries in quagmires?\n\n[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of May. See the full list. ]\n\nDrawing on the work of therapists, Diamond reports that the key for individuals coping with a crisis is \"selective change.\" People who successfully overcome a problem tend to identify and isolate it, figuring out \"which parts of their identities are already functioning well and don't need changing, and which parts are no longer working and do need changing.\" Diamond asks, Could the same be true for countries? He believes so, and he seeks to test his theory by adapting a dozen factors known to affect the resolution of personal crises to national crises. Some factors translate easily -- just as people must first accept being in crisis, nations must first come to a consensus about their woes. Other analogies feel more strained -- help from your close friends translates into material and financial aid from allies. Armed with this framework, Diamond sets out to see how well it fits countries' actual histories.\n\nDiamond's method is the case study. Looking at Finland, Japan, Chile, Indonesia, Germany, Australia and the United States at pivotal moments in their histories, he evaluates their courses of action with reference to his 12 bullet points. Meiji-era Japan, needing to open up to the world while preserving its cultural core, found a way \"to adopt many Western features, but to modify them to suit Japanese circumstances.\" After World War II, Germany worked its way to taking full responsibility for its actions and thereby successfully transformed itself. America, in part because it shrugs off the lessons of other places, struggles to resolve its issues.\n\nAt the end of each chapter, each mini-history, Diamond pauses to ask some variant of: \"How does Indonesia's crisis fit into our framework?\" And this is a tell. The Framework is driving the inquiry here, and everything stands at its service. The people we encounter are seldom richly portrayed, because only The Framework matters. The stories we learn about each country are often partial and slanted, because only The Framework matters. Countries where racism and tolerance, sexism and equality have long been in tension are portrayed as being entirely one thing before magically becoming the opposite thing, because The Framework can only process monoliths.\n\nWith a focus on The Framework, facts recede in importance. The book is riddled with errors. Diamond gets wrong the year of the Brexit vote. He claims that, under President Ronald Reagan, \"government shutdowns were nonexistent.\" But they occurred a number of times. He describes Australian-rules football as a sport \"invented in Australia and played nowhere else.\" But it is played elsewhere -- in Nauru, where it is the national sport, as well as in China, Canada, France, Japan, Ireland and the United States, according to the Australian Football League.\n\nDiamond says a 1976 terrorist attack in Washington, D.C., targeting a former Chilean official, was \"the only known case of a foreign terrorist killing an American citizen on American soil -- until the World Trade Towers attack of 2001.\" This claim wholly overlooks the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, in which six people died. He refers to Lee Kuan Yew as \"Singapore's prime minister,\" even though he no longer occupies that role, not least because he's dead.\n\nThen the generalizations: hoo boy. At one point during World War II, Diamond says, the people of Finland, facing Soviet bellicosity, \"were unanimous in refusing to compromise further.\" A whole nation, unanimous! We learn of another instance of 100 percent society-wide agreement down under, where \"Australians debating the federal constitution argued about many matters but were unanimous about excluding all nonwhite races from Australia.\" But in fact they argued about this issue, too, and one framer, Andrew Inglis Clark, the Tasmanian attorney general, sought, unsuccessfully, to introduce an adapted version of the American 14th Amendment, which would have prohibited discrimination by race.\n\nIn claiming that Germany has become more socially liberal, Diamond claims, \"There is no spanking of children; in fact, it's now forbidden by law!\" But how can a serious thinker confuse the passage of a law with fidelity to it? An organization that tracks the efficacy of the law has found its enactment to have reduced, but hardly ended hitting. To read Diamond is also to learn, apparently, how all Chileans identify (with Europe and the United States, not Latin America); and how all \"Indonesians take their national identity for granted.\" (Except, perhaps, the separatist groups?)\n\nSometimes the book feels written from a drying well of lifelong research rather than from the latest facts. For example, Diamond tells us Americans have always been a highly mobile people and are \"unlikely\" to \"move less often.\" He must be unfamiliar with the rather well-publicized new data declaring the opposite: \"Fewer Americans Are Moving to Pursue Better Jobs Across the Nation,\" NPR says, citing the Census Bureau's research that the number of Americans who move in a given year has dropped by half since the 1940s.\n\nThere are far more of these errors than I have space to list, too many to dismiss this calling-out as nit-picking. And they matter because of the book's nature. If we can't trust you on the little and medium things, how can we trust you where authors of 30,000-foot books really need our trust -- on the big, hard-to-check claims? On how the end of the White Australia policy \"resulted from five considerations.\" (Not four, not six, and the ones you happen to name.) On how Finns' love of their language is what made them willing to fight and die for Finland. On how Tokyo is clean \"because Japanese children learn to be clean and to clean up\" (and not, for example, because the city spends 3.9 percent of its budget on public health and sanitation, according to a quick search, compared with the 1.9 percent of New York City's 2018 budget that went to the Department of Sanitation).\n\nWhile \"Upheaval\" does list sources in the back, Diamond seldom quotes books. He is far fonder of quoting his many friends. \"Why does Japan pursue these stances? My Japanese friends suggest three explanations.\" That's what we're going with? Or he describes \"the 1973 coup that many of my Chilean friends characterize as inevitable.\" First of all, why are we paying you to hear your friends' random theories? Second of all, how can a coup ever be inevitable? You mean to say that a plot as delicate as that could under no scenario have gone wrong?\n\nSince we're talking about our friends, I know so many younger writers, especially women and people of color, who are smart, thoughtful, buttoned up and pretty damn accurate who would kill for an opening to publish a book with a serious publisher -- and who know in their bones that, if they were ever this sloppy, their career would be over before it had even begun.\n\nThere is also a systemic issue here. The time has come for those of us who work in book-length nonfiction to insist that professional fact-checking become as inalienable from publishing as publicity, marketing and jacket design -- and at the publisher's expense rather than as a cost passed on to the author, who, understandably, will often choose to spend her money on health care. In the age of tweets, it cannot be the fate of the book to become ever more tweetlike -- maybe factual, maybe whatever. The book must stand apart, must stand above.\n\nA remaining problem with \"Upheaval\" is one that cannot be fact-checked away, but, happily, is already being fixed across the world of letters. Until recently, in much of American life, and American writing, the default setting of human being was white and/or male. Today so much writing shatters this default, complicates the point of view. And \"Upheaval\" reminds us why that matters.\n\nWhen Diamond describes \"highly egalitarian social values\" as an ethos that has \"remained unchanged\" in Australia, despite having written a chapter about the country's history of legalized racism, he is using a definition of egalitarian that applies only to white people. When he says, \"Social status in Japan depends more on education than on heredity and family connection,\" he is ignoring what it means to be born a woman. \"Of course, my list of U.S. problems isn't exhaustive,\" he admits. \"Problems that I don't discuss include race relations and the role of women.\" You know, the problems affecting the vast majority of Americans.\n\nI almost felt bad for Diamond when, toward the end, he described \"an evening with two women friends, one of them a psychologically na\u00efve optimist in her 20s, the other a perceptive person in her 70s.\" What made the young woman \"psychologically na\u00efve\" to him was that she dated someone who it took her time to see was terrible. (If that's a crime, jail us all.) I felt a strange sympathy for Diamond, who is in his early 80s, because clearly he didn't realize how tone-deaf it is, in 2019, for an established male author to go around labeling a young woman making pretty normal life mistakes as \"psychologically na\u00efve.\" But Diamond is proud to be from another time. He tells us his manuscripts are typed by someone else, he relies on his wife and secretary to use a computer, and he clings to the belief that video games are \"solitary,\" even if massively multiplayer online games are where a growing number of Americans go to be social. He also thinks phones are ruining America because people check them every four minutes. But I have to say, I was doing just that while reading his book, and I was doing it because so many things I read didn't sound accurate, and I, for one, think it's an improvement when 30,000-foot authority can be challenged by Googling from bed.\n\nOn a beach some time ago, I read Jill Lepore's new history of the United States, \"These Truths.\" It is no less ambitious than \"Upheaval.\" But it is a new kind of big book for a new age.

She has signaled she will step down if her thrice-rejected divorce deal fails again in the House of Commons, as it is widely expected to do.\n\nIn a sign that the British public has already moved on, many of the questions May fielded during Tuesday's news conference had to do with when she will resign and what might happen after that.\n\nParliament is scheduled to vote again on the Brexit deal she negotiated with the European Union during the first week of June -- which, coincidentally, is also when President Trump will be making a state visit to Britain.\n\n\"What I'm doing today is setting out what I believe is a new Brexit deal that can command a majority in the House of Commons,\" said May, a fatally wounded but dogged politician.\n\nOffering a binding vote on a second referendum, as well as on whether Britain should remain in a temporary customs union with the E.U., represents a shift in strategy for May. She said she recognized \"the genuine and sincere strength of feeling\" on the referendum issue. But she also reiterated her long held views that a second referendum was not her preferred way out of the current Brexit impasse. Extending the Brexit debate, she said, \"risked opening the door to a nightmare future of permanently polarized politics.\"\n\nMay hopes that with those additional voting opportunities and some tweaks to her deal -- including pledges on environmental protections and workers' rights -- she can win over enough lawmakers to get it over the line. But early indicators were not looking good.\n\nSome Conservative lawmakers who'd previously backed May said they would now oppose her. The Scottish National Party and ChangeUK said they would not back her. Nigel Dodds, the deputy leader of Northern Ireland Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May's Conservatives, said the proposal had \"fundamental flaws.\"\n\nThe opposition Labour Party has been internally divided on whether to push for a second referendum, with leader Jeremy Corbyn reluctant to embrace the idea.\n\nIn a speech that was at times reflective, May said that she never thought that delivering Brexit would be \"simple or straightforward,\" but said that it had \"proved even harder than I anticipated.\" She said that she'd given it her all, even offering to \"give up the job I love earlier than I like.\"\n\nIn the question-and-answer session that followed her speech, May was asked several times about her departure and who she'd like to see replace her. May didn't offer fresh details, but she has previously promised to outline the timetable of her departure if she loses the next Brexit vote.\n\nThe unofficial race to replace her is underway. On Tuesday, Jacob Rees-Mogg, an influential Brexiteer, said he was throwing his support behind the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, the leader in the polls.\n\nRead more\n\nChelsea Flower Show wows with a royal treehouse and climate change garden\n\nBrexit talks collapse, setting up Theresa May's likely departure\n\nBritish voters with Brexit on their minds punish main parties in local elections", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GbUpv5Ydn2kTElVHpYcP-konC-M=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I3YVXHT334I6TJNTGTZ634JVDY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4797625", "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 296161620}, {"uri": "1141666726", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "17:56:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T17:56:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/chelsea-flower-show-wows-with-a-royal-treehouse-and-climate-change-garden/2019/05/21/361d4288-7b17-11e9-b1f3-b233fe5811ef_story.html", "title": "Chelsea Flower Show wows with a royal treehouse and climate change garden", "body": "Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, shows Queen Elizabeth II around the \"Back to Nature\" garden she designed for the 2019 Chelsea Flower Show in London. (Geoff Pugh/AFP/Getty Images) By William Booth William Booth London bureau chief May 21 at 1:24 PM\n\nLONDON -- The Chelsea Flower Show -- the most prestigious, most over-the-top floral exhibition in the world -- opened Tuesday with a visit from the queen to her granddaughter-in-law's luxe-rustic kiddie treehouse set in a pop-up English countryside simulacrum, next to the champagne and gin tents, already doing brisk business in the morning sunshine.\n\nCarrying on since 1913, with brief pause for two world wars, the Chelsea show still manages to be fun and besotted, fuddy-duddy and cutting-edge. It marks the beginning of the English summer social season, with gents in straw hats, ladies in floral frocks. And it draws sold-out throngs of plant obsessives to stroll the transformed greensward of the Royal Hospital and smell the patent-pending roses.\n\nThe loss of empire and the looming Brexit be damned, nobody does puttering in the backyard quite like Britain, still the globe's greatest gardening nation.\n\nThis year's big display gardens featured an homage to the Yorkshire countryside, complete with a working canal lock; a sand-dune flavored lounge-thing from Dubai; several \"urban gardens\" for clients with penthouse spaces and big bucks (they were awesome, needed to green the cities); a \"Resilience Garden,\" a first here that focuses on Britain's changing climate (think yucca in Wessex, prickly pear in Kent); and a quiet, cool, green one for Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), the show's sponsors, called the \"Back To Nature\" garden.\n\nThis last doozy was co-designed by Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, wife to a most likely future king, Prince William, and mother to three heirs and spares.\n\nKate's \"woodland space\" was \"inspired by childhood memories ... a place to retreat from the world, to play, learn and discover as well as create special family memories,\" as described by the RHS.\n\nThe forests, the pamphlet informed, are good for a child's mental health and development.\n\nA treehouse perched on an ancient stump (cost unknown), clad in stag horn oak, was the centerpiece. There was a flowing pebbled brook to play in, a swing to swing on, and a hollow log to crawl through.\n\nThere was also a twee teepee made of sticks, a crude bow and arrow, and a wee fire pit -- the perfect setting to learn to play responsibly with matches and DIY weapons.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II, dressed in a green coat over a purple and green floral frock, gave it high royal marks.\n\n\"It's very tidy,\" the Queen said Tuesday morning, according to royal pool report.\n\nWilliam and Kate's kids visited over the weekend and were photographed, appropriately frolicking about in bare feet and perfect little outfits.\n\nThese show pieces and feature displays -- the biggest gardens occupy 2,800 square feet, the floor plan of an ample home -- can take weeks of feverish work to assemble, completely from scratch, with \"planting teams\" going at it almost 24/7, erecting mature (transplanted) elms, sequoias, cedars.\n\nChelsea Pensioners pose for photographers on a stand at the Chelsea Flower Show in London. (Matt Dunham/AP)\n\nOne of the gardens this year featured a temporary giant redwood, 42 feet tall, perhaps one the tallest ever at Chelsea. It will live here until Saturday and then be transferred elsewhere.\n\nA veteran garden designer confessed that they used to compost most of the plants, which were at their peak for the show -- though that practice has ended, and many survivors now find new homes in charity gardens or posh new settings.\n\nThe sheer overabundance of blooms, the perfect shabby-chic of the cottage styles are delirious. Each plant spooning the next, everything just right. As if they were hired like the wait staff, the gardens were already covered in bees.\n\nYou may want this garden.\n\nYou will never have this garden.\n\nThe artistry of re-creation is eye-popping.\n\nThe still unfurling ferns, old wooly moss, peak wildflowers appear as you find them in the heritage Grade II cottage in Somerset.\n\nBut none of this was here in April.\n\nThis year marks designer Mark Gregory's 99th Chelsea garden. His replica of a west Yorkshire canal and lock tender's cottage required the efforts of 60 workers, with cranes and hydraulics.\n\nPeople, there were dewy spider webs -- already!\n\nGregory said the show highlights \"something we're still good at, which is growing plants.\"\n\nHe said, \"we were once a great industrial powerhouse. Not so much now, I would say. But at horticultural? We're hard to beat.\"\n\nA model poses with a peony design body paint and hat at the Chelsea Flower Show. (Matt Dunham/AP)\n\nGregory said plants for gardens and vases outpace edible crops in Britain in gross domestic product.\n\nThe secret? \"Great climate, crap weather,\" he said, meaning it rains a lot but not too much, and is cool but not freezing, and warm in the summer, but not Kuwait.\n\nEngland has been nuts for plants since the Victorians made it an obsession. The Chelsea Flower Show is \"a shop window for the world,\" said Raymond Evison, who's been cultivating clematis on the England's balmy offshore tax haven island of Guernsey for decades. He sells 2 million plants a year, almost half to America.\n\nThe latest trend? \"More leisure time, but less time for gardening,\" he said. Clients want plants that burst into summer-long bloom, but don't require a lot of pruning.\n\nAnother trend? \"The Chinese,\" he said. They love the Chelsea Flower Show.\n\nThis was the first Chelsea show since the death of David Austin, Britain's most famous plant breeder, credited with restoring fragrance to the modern rose. But his family and company carried on, with two new roses and a \"Secret Garden\" themed display.\n\nDesigner Sarah Eberle made the Resilience Garden for this year's show. \"I wanted to deliver a message, come on, climate change is real, it's here, it's coming.\"\n\nAn exhibitor poses in a cactus design jacket at her stand at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show. (Toby Melville/Reuters)\n\nWhat would she grow in her English cottage garden of the future?\n\n\"It's not the future,\" she corrected.\n\nShe'd plant cacti, aloe, yucca. She'd plant trees that are drought-resistant, pest-resistant, that could handle new extremes -- too hot, too cold, at all the wrong times.\n\nShe'd manage her water better.\n\nEberle has been a garden designer for 40 years. She offered an observation. Early in her career, the wisdom went, a gardener here cut down her herbaceous perennials to the ground in late October. They'd sleep through the winter, grow again in the spring.\n\nBut now? \"They're growing waist-high by Christmas,\" she said. \"This is just in my years. There's no hard winter anymore. Many people might miss it. But a gardener? A gardener sees it with her own eyes.\"\n\nRead more\n\nPower pearls and political handbags: Margaret Thatcher auction fetches $1.4 million\n\nHow hippies, farmers and Prince Charles are preserving the ancient art of hedgelaying\n\nBritain's queen is counting her swans in a ritual with much poop and circumstance", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gS6-YBOUO8opufimSyyL1rZw0Vw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HQ3ZPLT3ZMI6TJNTGTZ634JVDY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4799722", "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 296157360}, {"uri": "1141642641", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "17:22:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T17:22:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4588235318660736, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/world/europe/theresa-may-referendum-brexit.html", "title": "Theresa May Offers U.K. Lawmakers a Vote on a Second Referendum", "body": "LONDON -- Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain on Tuesday dangled before lawmakers the prospect of a second referendum on Brexit, in a last-ditch effort to win over those who have rejected her three previous efforts to extract Britain from the European Union.\n\nIn a speech in London, Mrs. May outlined what she called a \"new Brexit deal,\" which would give Parliament a broader role in shaping her Brexit plan. But most attention focused on her offer to have lawmakers vote on whether to have a second referendum, something she had previously ruled out.\n\nMrs. May described the deal as \"one last chance\" to deliver on the 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union.\n\nIf lawmakers reject it again, she said, \"they are voting to stop Brexit.\" She added, \"If they do so, the consequences could hardly be greater.\"\n\nEarly reaction among Conservatives and Labour was not encouraging.\n\nThe Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said his party would not support the plan, calling it a \"rehash of what was discussed before.\" Pro-Brexit Conservatives reacted angrily as well, with Jacob Rees-Mogg, a lawmaker and leader of that faction, dismissing it as \"worse than before.\"\n\nOn the referendum, it was unclear how much of a concession Mrs. May was making. That is because she was offering lawmakers a chance to vote on whether to have a referendum, rather than supporting one herself. And she was vague about what question or questions any referendum would pose.\n\nHer new deal seemed designed to entice pro-Brexit Labour Party lawmakers to support her Brexit blueprint. It includes the opportunity for Parliament to decide on whether to keep a type of customs union with Brussels, eliminating tariffs and reducing checks on goods at frontiers -- a demand of Mr. Corbyn.\n\nBut in moving somewhat closer to Labour's position, she risked losing Conservative supporters of her plan.\n\nNor was she guaranteeing any new consensus on sensitive issues. Parliament has previously voted against a second referendum, and Mrs. May said she still opposed the idea, making it unlikely there would be sufficient support for it this time. Nor has Parliament yet managed to coalesce around any plan to stay in a customs union with the bloc.\n\nThe vote on legislation to leave the bloc, known as the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, is scheduled for the week beginning June 3. It is likely to be the final significant act of Mrs. May's tenure, as she has promised to set a date for her departure after the decision, ending almost three troubled years in power.\n\nMrs. May's latest Brexit deal differs from her previous one in that it offers Labour lawmakers more assurances on European standards on workplace protections and environmental rights.\n\nShe would also allow Parliament the right to demand, at least temporarily, a type of customs union with the bloc that is designed to prevent tariffs and many border checks on industrial goods, but only until the next general election, scheduled for 2022. And she is also offering the opportunity to vote on the second referendum.\n\nFor Conservative Brexit supporters the bill has some sweeteners in that it commits the government to working on technical measures to track goods that would prevent the need for border checks at the Irish border.\n\nCritically, however, this would not guarantee Britain staying out of the so-called Irish backstop, a device to avoid a hard border with Ireland. The backstop would keep the whole of the United Kingdom tied to Europe's customs rules indefinitely, outraging Brexit supporters who say it defeats the whole purpose of Brexit.\n\nOn Tuesday there was a backlash from hard-line pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers, including Iain Duncan Smith, a former party leader.\n\n\"The backstop is still there, it's a customs union in all but name and it puts Brussels firmly in control of our destiny,\" he said in a statement, adding that there was \"nothing new or bold about this bad buffet of non-Brexit options,\"\n\nOn Tuesday Mrs. May at least secured support from her fractured cabinet for her plan, no mean feat in itself. Yet, in Parliament, the math does not appear to have changed for Mrs. May -- at least not for the better.\n\nHer Conservatives are braced for a humiliating defeat in European elections this week, confronted by the challenge of the Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage, who wants Britain to leave the European Union fast, without any deal if necessary.\n\nSeveral of those vying to succeed Mrs. May are already arguing the same hard Brexit line. As a result, several hard-line pro-Brexit supporters within Mrs. May's Conservative Party, who reluctantly supported the last of her three efforts to get the plan through Parliament, are indicating they will revert to their earlier hostility.\n\nMark Francois, a prominent member of the hard-line Brexit faction told the BBC that the opposition to Mrs. May's deal was \"going up, not down.\"\n\n\"Unless she is rescued by a Marxist,\" said Mr. Francois, referring to Mr. Corbyn, \"the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead on arrival.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_castle@nytimes.com", "name": "Stephen Castle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/31/world/31may/31may-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4797625", "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 296155320}, {"uri": "1141509649", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "14:29:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T14:29:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2019/05/21/daily-202-why-a-judge-compared-trump-to-james-buchanan-in-ruling-against-his-bid-to-conceal-financial-records/5ce2f1351ad2e54b957e7fc6/", "title": "Analysis | The Daily 202: Why a judge compared Trump to James Buchanan in ruling against his bid to conceal financial records", "body": "THE BIG IDEA: Just like President Trump, James Buchanan complained of \"harassment\" by Congress.\n\nA federal judge on Monday drew a parallel between the two presidents as he rejected an effort by Trump's lawyers to quash a subpoena from the House Oversight Committee for records from the president's accounting firm. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta of the District of Columbia opened his 41-page opinion with a lengthy quote from Buchanan complaining, in 1860, about the House opening an investigation into him.\n\n\"He maintained that the House of Representatives possessed no general powers to investigate him, except when sitting as an impeaching body,\" Mehta noted. \"Buchanan feared that, if the House were to exercise such authority, it 'would establish a precedent dangerous and embarrassing to all my successors, to whatever political party they might be attached.' Some 160 years later, President Donald J. Trump has taken up the fight of his predecessor.\"\n\nFor Mehta to lead with Buchanan, and such an explicit comparison to the current occupant of the Oval Office, is the judicial equivalent of what kids call a sick burn. Mehta's opinion goes on to offer a meaty history lesson for a president who has never cared much for the discipline. The judge cites Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton as he outlines why the House is entitled to the records it seeks. After recounting the Whitewater, Watergate and Teapot Dome investigations, Mehta concludes: \"This court is not prepared to roll back the tide of history.\"\n\n-- By any metric, Buchanan was one of our worst presidents. He was elected president in 1856. In the 1858 midterms, Republicans won functional control of the House with a plurality. But Democrats still held the Senate and the White House and controlled the Supreme Court. Washington descended into a gridlock far worse than what we know now. Sectional differences splintered Democrats between the North and South. Faced with Abraham Lincoln's likely victory in 1860, the proslavery \"fire-eaters\" advocated secession. Buchanan took the position that states didn't have the legal right to secede, but that there was nothing the federal government could do legally to stop them. He allowed the country to fall apart with a policy of inactivity during the transition. It took Lincoln's heroic leadership, four years and countless casualties to put down the rebellion.\n\n-- In addition to being feckless, the Buchanan administration was corrupt. Jasmin Bath, a historian of 19th-century political and economic culture, wrote a piece for the Outlook section last week about the committee that Buchanan was so angry about: \"Without Pennsylvania, Buchanan would not have gained enough electoral votes to win. Knowing this, state Democrats did what they could to get Buchanan into the White House, including using federal funds to finance their campaign. Although this was not uncovered until four years later, suspicions of payoffs and fraud tainted Buchanan's victory. ...\n\n\"In March 1860, a congressional committee made up of three Republicans and two Democrats began investigating. Nicknamed the Covode Committee after its chairman, John Covode, it produced a detailed majority report that exposed the crimes of the Democratic Party and the president himself. The sheer volume of corruption uncovered was startling. Although there was not enough evidence to impeach Buchanan, the report exposed extensive corruption that took place during his presidency: bribery, the disfranchisement of some voters in federal elections, abuses of printing contracts, subsidies for partisan presses from public accounts. The list went on and on.\n\n\"The committee's findings were released to the public in June 1860, just months before the presidential election, and proved to be incredibly damaging to the Democratic Party's reputation, even though Buchanan was not running again. Its detailed accounts of the misdeeds of the Democratic administration, which circulated throughout the North, gave the Republican Party substantial evidence with which to persuade the public that the United States could not afford the continued reign of the 'rotten and dishonest' Democratic politicians.\n\n\"Many contemporaries believed the Covode report had an impact on the results of the election. According to one Democratic campaign manager, August Belmont, 'the country at large had become disgusted with the misrule of Mr. Buchanan, and the corruption which disgraced his Administration' and the 'Democratic party was made answerable for [Buchanan's] misdeeds, and change was ardently desired by thousands of conservative men out of politics.' Even Southerners agreed. One slaver owner, Sidney George Fisher, argued that 'the corruptions and excesses of the administration were very influential in producing Republican victory.'\"\n\n-- Mehta outlined how reviewing financial records fits \"comfortably\" within Congress's broad powers. He said the legislative branch serves an \"informing function\" that boils down to the ability to expose corruption in the other branches. \"It is simply not fathomable that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct -- past or present -- even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry,\" wrote Mehta, who was appointed by Barack Obama.\n\n-- Trump called the decision \"crazy\" and promised to challenge it. \"We think it's totally the wrong decision by, obviously, an Obama-appointed judge,\" he told reporters.\n\n-- The judge gave Trump one week to formally appeal. \"The President is subject to the same legal standard as any other litigant that does not prevail,\" he noted.\n\n-- The ruling came down shortly after the White House officially blocked former counsel Don McGahn from testifying to Congress, releasing a memo from a Trump appointee at the Justice Department to justify the decision. \"The 15-page legal opinion written by Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel argues McGahn cannot be compelled to testify before the committee, based on past Justice Department legal opinions regarding the president's close advisers,\" Rachael Bade, Josh Dawsey and Devlin Barrett report. \"The memo says McGahn's immunity from congressional testimony is separate and broader than a claim of executive privilege. ...\n\n\"As a private citizen no longer in the government, McGahn is not necessarily bound by the White House directive ... [but his] lawyer, William A. Burck, said the former counsel would not testify. 'Mr. McGahn remains obligated to maintain the status quo and will respect the President's instruction,' Burck wrote. Testifying could jeopardize business and professional standing for McGahn, who works for Jones Day, a Republican law firm with close ties to the Trump campaign and electoral politics. Jones Day will still be involved in the reelection campaign but will have a reduced role from 2016, campaign officials say, when they were the main firm.\"\n\n-- Nancy Pelosi repeatedly cited Mehta's opinion last night during private sessions aimed at discouraging members of her own leadership team from breaking with her publicly on impeachment in the face of Trump's stonewalling vis-a-vis McGahn. \"Today we won our first case,\" she told a group of House Democrats, according to someone in the room. \"We've been in this thing for almost five months, and now we're getting some results. ... We still have unexhausted avenues here.\"\n\nAfter meeting privately with Pelosi last night, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler also mentioned Mehta's ruling as a reason not to jump the gun on impeachment. \"We have to enforce the right to our testimony through the courts, which is the only way you can do it,\" the New York Democrat told reporters staking out the speaker's office. \"And, right now, we're having very good success with it.\"\n\nBut at least five members of Pelosi's leadership team -- four of whom also sit on the House Judiciary Committee -- pressed Pelosi in a closed-door leadership meeting to allow the panel to start an inquiry. Bade and Mike DeBonis report: \"The meeting marks the first time a chairman and top rank-and-file lawmakers ... have lobbied her to change her long-held position on impeachment. Judiciary Committee members for days have discussed how to move the speaker toward their thinking, but few have been willing to break with her publicly. However, a core group of Judiciary Democrats plans to begin calling Tuesday for an impeachment inquiry if [McGahn] does not show for subpoenaed testimony. ...\n\n\"During the Monday night leadership meeting, Pelosi spoke about how Democrats' messaging isn't breaking through because everyone is talking about corruption, [Bob] Mueller's report and impeachment. She bemoaned the fact that last week the investigations were making page one news while the House's passage of the Equality Act -- a bill aimed at ensuring that gay, lesbian and bisexual people are not discriminated against -- was on 'Page 26.' That's when Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), chairman of a Judiciary subcommittee, jumped in to tell Pelosi that it amounted to a good case for launching an impeachment inquiry ... Raskin argued that such an inquiry would allow leadership to streamline and centralize all of the investigations into one. ... 'You want to tell Elijah Cummings to go home?' Pelosi said, referring to the House Oversight and Reform Committee chairman. ...\n\n\"During the leadership meeting, three other Judiciary Committee members -- [Rep. David] Cicilline (D-R.I.), Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and freshman Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) -- backed Raskin. ... Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), a fierce Pelosi defender and ally, grew angry and scolded the lawmakers that an impeachment inquiry would further distract from legislating. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos (Ill.) -- who has argued before that legislators should move on from impeachment talk -- pushed back as well, noting that when the DCCC asked voters in focus groups what topics they cared about, Mueller's inquiry ranked near the bottom.\"\n\n-- Trump relishes a fight and loves a good foil. House Democrats give him both. With his refusal to give an inch, Trump seems to be trying to goad Democrats into taking the next step. The White House is currently blocking more than 20 Democratic investigations into Trump, his finances or his policies.\n\n-- Even if House Democrats do decide to begin impeachment proceedings, a key factor that protects the president from being removed from office is that only one Republican in either chamber of Congress appears anywhere close to advocating his removal from office. Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) drew a primary challenger yesterday after he became the first Republican member of Congress to say publicly that Trump has committed impeachable offenses. The Detroit Free Press's Todd Spangler reports: \"State Rep. Jim Lower, R-Greenville, announced that he would run for the 3rd Congressional District seat Amash has held since 2011 and would forgo a race for a third term in the state House. Lower said he had been planning to run for some time and had expected to make an announcement closer to July 4.\"\n\n-- Amash has put his fellow congressional Republicans in a pickle. DeBonis and Bade report: \"Top Republican lawmakers and aides said Monday that kicking Amash out of the GOP conference or off his committee would only draw more attention to his apostasy. Instead, they have focused on isolating Amash and portraying him as an outlier. The House Freedom Caucus, a conservative group of which Amash is a member, also took a position Monday night 'strongly disagreeing' with Amash's comments.\"\n\n-- Harry Reid, battling pancreatic cancer in Las Vegas, said he shares Pelosi's concerns about political backlash from impeachment. \"Because you don't have to go very far to remember what happened. I mean, Clinton was impeached -- it helped him. I've been saying that for several months,\" the former Senate majority leader told the New York Times's Jonathan Martin. He narrowly held off a challenge in 1998 from John Ensign by 428 votes, perhaps thanks to voter unease with the GOP impeaching Clinton.\n\n\"I believe Jerry Nadler is handling things the right way,\" the 79-year-old added. \"I think the Mueller report deserves a full airing, I think that there should be witnesses, and I think that Trump better be very careful. Because if they're going to order McGahn and Mueller and others not to testify, I think that opens the door to impeachment. ... [The] trigger point is if they try to not allow people to come forward and testify.\"\n\nTHE CASE IS NOT CLOSED:\n\n-- Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, told a House panel earlier this year that Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow encouraged him to lie under oath and claim that negotiations for Trump Tower Moscow ended in January 2016. Tom Hamburger, Ellen Nakashima and Karoun Demirjian report: \"In fact, Cohen later admitted, discussions on the Moscow tower continued into June of the presidential election year, after it was clear Trump would be the GOP nominee. ...\n\n\"House Democrats are now scrutinizing whether Sekulow or other Trump attorneys played a role in shaping Cohen's 2017 testimony to Congress. ... Attorneys for Sekulow said in a statement that 'Cohen's alleged statements are more of the same from him and confirm the observations of prosecutors in the Southern District of New York that Cohen's 'instinct to blame others is strong.' ...\n\n\"Cohen also said he spoke to Sekulow about a potential pardon 'quite a few' times 'before and after' his testimony to the committee. He said Sekulow didn't say directly that the president was considering giving him a pardon, but rather said 'there's always the possibility of a pre-pardon.'\"\n\n-- New York prosecutors are scrutinizing thousands of documents relating to Trump's inauguration. CNN's Kara Scannell reports: \"The President's Inaugural Committee handed over the cache of documents over the course of several weeks in response to a wide-ranging subpoena seeking documents, records, and communications concerning the inaugural's finances, vendors, and donors sent in February by the US attorney's office with the Southern District of New York. The last set of documents was produced within the last month. The end of the document production indicates the investigation is moving into the next stage.\"\n\n-- Sweden formally issued an extradition request for Julian Assange. The WikiLeaks founder is serving time in Britain for skipping bail, but he's wanted in Stockholm to face sexual assault charges. This could set off a tug of war between Sweden and the United States, which wants Assange extradited on allegations of conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer. (AP)\n\n-- Russians seeking to interfere in U.S. elections strategized about how to sow racial discord here as recently as last year, according to newly obtained documents. NBC News's Richard Engel, Kate Benyon-Tinker and Kennett Werner report: \"Communications between associates of Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Kremlin-linked oligarch indicted by [Mueller] for previous influence operations against the U.S. ... laid out a new plot to manipulate and radicalize African-Americans. The plans show that Prigozhin's circle has sought to exploit racial tensions well beyond Russia's social media and misinformation efforts tied to the 2016 election. ... One document said that [Trump's] election had 'deepened conflicts in American society' and suggested that, if successful, the influence project would 'undermine the country's territorial integrity and military and economic potential.'\"\n\nTHE RULE OF LAW:\n\n-- At a rally in Pennsylvania last night, Trump criticized Hillary Clinton. When the crowd began chanting \"Lock her up,\" the president replied: \"We have a great new attorney general who's going to give it a very fair look.\"\n\n-- That attorney general, Bill Barr, insisted in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he's fighting more to protect the institution of the presidency than Trump personally. The Journal's Sadie Gurman reports: \"'I felt the rules were being changed to hurt Trump, and I thought it was damaging for the presidency over the long haul,' Mr. Barr said. ... 'At every grave juncture the presidency has done what it is supposed to do, which is to provide leadership and direction,' he said in an interview. 'If you destroy the presidency and make it an errand boy for Congress, we're going to be a much weaker and more divided nation.' ... Many current and former law-enforcement officials have come to view Mr. Barr skeptically, citing his newly launched review of the investigation's origins and what he termed 'spying' on Trump campaign associates over ties to Russians. He hasn't explained what specifically prompted his concerns.\"\n\n-- Trump also called for the government to investigate Joe Biden's son, Hunter, over his business deals in China during an interview that aired Sunday on Fox News. It's a fresh illustration of the president's personal disdain for the rule of law. The Times's Maggie Haberman, Annie Karni, Ken Vogel and Katie Benner report: \"It was the latest in a long series of statements by Mr. Trump suggesting he would like to see criminal investigations of opponents including Clinton, John Kerry and the Democratic National Committee, and it came as the president seems particularly preoccupied by Mr. Biden's candidacy. ... 'It's a terrible breach of norms for the president to publicly advocate prosecutions of his opponents,' said Jack Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School who was an assistant attorney general during President George W. Bush's first term.\"\n\n-- At his rally in Pennsylvania last night, Trump prosecuted an economic case against Joe Biden. Anne Gearan reports from Montoursville, Pa.: \"The president touted an economic turnaround on his watch, saying Pennsylvania now has historically low unemployment that no political competitor could best. 'Sleepy Joe said that he's running to, quote, \"save the world,\"' Trump said to laughter from supporters. 'Well, he was: He was going to save every country but ours!' Trump's 'Make America Great Again' rally at an airport hangar in this small north-central Pennsylvania town was nominally a show of support for Republican state Rep. Fred Keller, the heavy favorite in a special election Tuesday to fill the congressional seat vacated in January by Tom Marino, a Republican who had just been reelected to his fifth term. ...\n\n\"Trump called a pan-Asia trade deal backed by Biden 'a disaster' for Pennsylvania and singled out remarks Biden recently made about charting a new course with China. Biden has staked much of his early campaign message on the theory that he can deny Trump a repeat victory here. A native of working-class Scranton, more than an hour to the east, Biden inaugurated his 2020 campaign in Pennsylvania and is using Philadelphia as his campaign headquarters. 'Biden deserted you,' Trump said. 'I guess he was born here, but he left you, he left you for another state.'\"\n\n-- Trump remains incredibly popular among blue-collar white workers in northeast Ohio, even though his presidency has not reversed the region's economic decline. The Times's Trip Gabriel has great reporting from the ground: \"The loss of 1,600 jobs in March at a General Motors plant in Lordstown, despite Mr. Trump's visible efforts to save them, was the latest blow. But even though stresses on families and communities are already acute, Mr. Trump appears to have lost little of his blue-collar support here. It is a sign of how tight a bond he has with voters who were once staunch Democrats, in an allegiance as much cultural as economic. But it also undermines the argument of [Biden] that he would be the best nominee to win back Midwest states because of his own appeal to working-class voters.\"\n\n-- Trump is preparing for a jet-setting summer of international travel to show stature on the world stage. The AP's Zeke Miller and Jill Colvin report: \"Four days in Tokyo. Then it's off to see Queen Elizabeth before a jaunt to Normandy, France, and perhaps time in Ireland. A return trip to Japan? Why not. And throw in Seoul. Then it's back to France for Trump for a summit with world leaders. ... The flurry of international travel is a marked change of pace for a president who likes to sleep in his own bed and rarely strays far from the White House unless it's to his own properties. The packed calendar is the product of both a concerted attempt by Trump to wrap himself in the trappings of the presidency heading into re-election season and a fluke of the global summit calendar.\"\n\n-- Despite his role as commander in chief, Trump continues to tweet out his thoughts about the 2020 Democrats like the country's \"narrator in chief.\" Ashley Parker and Robert Costa have a smart piece on how the president is always in your head, no matter if you love him or hate him: \"Trump in recent weeks has weighed in on actor Jussie Smollett's case in Chicago ('It is an embarrassment to our Nation!'), instructed the French government on how to fight the fire that engulfed Paris's Notre Dame Cathedral ('flying water tankers'), and disparaged what he viewed as the 'political correctness' of the Kentucky Derby ('It was a rough & tumble race on a wet and sloppy track'). ... Trump's naked eagerness to make any story or occasion about himself stems from his self-conception as both a star and a producer, a director and a writer, according to friends, advisers and critics. And now, they say, he is able to deploy the platform of the presidency to amplify that vision of himself as a leading man.\"\n\nEARTH IN THE BALANCE:\n\n-- The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution, which would make it easier to roll back key climate change rules. The Times's Lisa Friedman reports: \"The new analytical model would significantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted. ... The five people familiar with the plan, all current or former E.P.A. officials, said the new modeling method would appear in the agency's analysis of the final version of the replacement regulation, known as the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which is expected to be made public in June.\"\n\n-- The EPA is also cutting off funding for several research centers that study the effects of pollution on childhood development. Greenwire's Corbin Hiar and Ariel Wittenberg report: \"The move, critics say, is part of a broader effort by [Trump] to downplay science that could lead to stricter regulations on polluting industries. At issue are 13 Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Centers located at institutions across the country.\"\n\n-- The U.S. government put nuclear waste under a dome in the Marshall Islands. It is now cracking open. The president of the islands, Hilda Heine, is concerned that there's a risk of radioactive materials leaking. (Kyle Swenson)\n\n-- Bayer, Monsanto's new parent company, is facing thousands of new Roundup cancer lawsuits after a $2 billion judgment. Bayer plans on appealing the verdict, which awarded $1 billion each to a couple diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after they used the Roundup herbicide for years. (NBC News)\n\nTHE CHINA THREAT:\n\n-- Chinese leaders are preparing their citizens for a drawn-out trade war with Trump by evoking past battles with the Americans, including their assistance to North Korea during the 1950s. Anna Fifield reports: Chinese President Xi Jinping, \"accompanied by his top trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, on Monday placed a floral basket at a monument in Jiangxi province commemorating the start of the Long March in 1934. In the 4,000-mile, year-long trek, the Communists broke through Nationalist lines, eventually ousting them and installing Mao Zedong as leader of China. Meanwhile, China's main movie channel, CCTV-6, has scrapped its regular programming in favor of films about the Korean War, which ended in a draw after China intervened to fight back the Americans.\"\n\n-- U.S. technology companies started curbing sales to the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. Jeanne Whalen, Greg Bensinger, Ellen Nakashima and Hamza Shaban report: \"Google said it would restrict Huawei's access to future updates of its Android operating software, which powers many of Huawei's phones. Other U.S. manufacturers also began suspending business dealings with the Chinese firm. The markets punished many of those suppliers Monday, including Intel, Broadcom and Qualcomm, as well as Micron and semiconductor manufacturer Cypress. ... On Monday evening, the Commerce Department slightly eased the timing of the restrictions, saying it would allow some transactions to continue for 90 days, to facilitate 'certain activities necessary to the continued operations of existing networks and to support existing mobile services.'\"\n\n-- Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei said the confrontation between the U.S. and China that he's been caught up in was \"inevitable.\" He also said U.S. trade restrictions will not deter Huawei's 5G expansion plans. (South China Morning Post)\n\n-- Morgan Stanley said the collapse of U.S.-Chinese trade talks could push the global economy toward a recession. \"If talks stall, no deal is agreed upon and the U.S. imposes 25% tariffs on the remaining circa $300 billion of imports from China, we see the global economy heading towards recession,\" the bank's analysts said in a note. They added that such circumstances would force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates back to zero within a year. (Reuters)\n\n-- A Ukrainian aircraft engine factory has become the Chinese military's new cash-hungry partner. Anton Troianovski reports: \"The president of a top Ukrainian aerospace company says its new Chinese investors often ask the staff for 'little conversations.' They want to know about record-keeping and planning, the setup of production lines and the interplay between workshops. 'They'll talk for three hours, and the next day, a totally different group of people will come,' said Vyacheslav Boguslayev, whose sprawling Soviet-era company, Motor Sich, is one of the most advanced military aircraft engine manufacturers in the world. ... Racing to upgrade its military, China has been turning to Ukraine. And Ukraine -- with its economy scrambled by hostilities with Russia -- has been willing to accept China's embrace.\"\n\n-- The Department of Homeland Security warned that Chinese-made drones may be sharing sensitive flight data with their manufacturers. An alert from DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warns that the drones \"contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.\" (CNN)\n\n-- Detainees in China's reeducation camps for Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang are given an hour or so to cry every two weeks, according to a woman who was held at one of the facilities. From Radio Free Asia: \"Since April 2017, authorities in the XUAR have held an estimated 1.5 million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities accused of harboring 'strong religious views' and 'politically incorrect' ideas in the camps ... Reporting ... has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination [and] routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers ... Guzire Awulqanqizi, a Kazakh woman who was held at the Dongmehle Re-education Camp [said] that detainees dealing with the stress of 14-hour days of political study are given a 'crying session' every two weeks.\"\n\nTHE IMMIGRATION WARS:\n\n-- Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state who blew a totally winnable governor's race last fall because of his polarizing approach, gave the White House a detailed list of 10 demands for him to become Trump's \"immigration czar.\" The Times's Maggie Haberman and Annie Karni scoop: \"Access to a government jet 24 hours a day. An office in the West Wing, plus guaranteed weekends off for family time. And an assurance of being made secretary of homeland security by November. Those were among a list of 10 conditions ... Kobach also said he would need to be the main television spokesman for the Trump administration on immigration policy. And he said he wanted a guarantee that cabinet secretaries whose portfolios relate to immigration would defer to him, with the president mediating disputes if need be. The list was submitted by Mr. Kobach in recent weeks as he discussed his interest in the job. Other conditions included having a staff of seven reporting to him, 'walk in' privileges to the Oval Office, a security detail if deemed necessary and the title of assistant to the president. ... The existence of the list has become known among officials in the Trump administration, some of whom were taken aback by what they regard as its presumptuousness. Mr. Trump has also been considering others for the role, and he is said to be leaning toward Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the former Virginia attorney general. Mr. Cucinelli has made his own requests related to the job, such as a security detail and transportation to work.\"\n\n-- A 16-year-old Guatemalan boy detained at the southern border died while in U.S. custody in Texas. Abigail Hauslohner reports: \"Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez was found unresponsive in his detention cell 'during a welfare check' Monday, a day after a nurse practitioner had diagnosed him with Influenza A and Border Patrol officials had moved to isolate him from other detained migrants, a CBP official told reporters during a conference call. ... He is the fifth migrant child since December to die after being taken into custody at the southern border by federal immigration authorities.\"\n\n-- New documents show that immigrants detained by ICE are sometimes placed in solitary confinement for reasons unrelated to rule violations. NBC News's Hannah Rappleye, Andrew W. Lehren, Spencer Woodman and Vanessa Swales report: \"The newly-obtained documents paint a disturbing portrait of a system where detainees are sometimes forced into extended periods of isolation for reasons that have nothing to do with violating any rules. ... Only half of the cases involved punishment for rule violations. The other half were unrelated to disciplinary concerns -- they involve the mentally ill, the disabled or others who were sent to solitary largely for what ICE described as safety reasons.\"\n\n-- Meanwhile, down under, Australia's reelection of its conservative government has triggered a spate of suicide attempts among the country's refugees. From France 24: \"Many had prayed for a more lenient policy from Labor, who had been strongly tipped to win. But an unexpected victory by Scott Morrison's centre-right coalition ... dashed hopes and set off a wave of self-harm including several hospitalisations.\"\n\nALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN AND WOMEN:\n\n-- George Papadopoulos, a member of Trump's 2016 campaign, is a perfect metaphor for 2019. T.A. Frank profiles him for this Sunday's Washington Post Magazine: \"I first met George Papadopoulos, the unlikely trigger of an investigation that many thought would take down Donald Trump, on a balmy California day in December 2018, less than a week after his release from federal prison. ... His 12 days in prison, he said, were worst before the fact. The reality of minimum-security confinement came as a relief. 'You're expecting you're going in to get raped and killed,' he said. 'I get inside the prison, and the guards are basically mocking my sentence: 'You're more trouble for us than we are for you.'\u2009' ... In person, he came across as warm, oddly guileless and eager to please. He made boastful claims. ('I was on a first-name basis with Netanyahu for four years.') He made ingratiating claims. ('As an individual I'm more comfortable with Washington Post people like you than with, I dunno, the Daily Caller.') And then there was his central claim: that the entire federal investigation of Trump had its origins in dirty tricks masterminded by a group of foreign and U.S. intelligence entities.\"\n\n-- \"Fox & Friends\" co-host Pete Hegseth privately lobbied Trump to pardon U.S. servicemen accused and convicted of war crimes. Hegseth, an Iraq War veteran, has pressed the president to pardon the men since as early as January. (The Daily Beast)\n\n-- Former Trump associate Roger Stone wants a judge's permission to appear at a strip club in Tennessee where he is scheduled to judge a national exotic dancer competition. Mother Jones's Dan Friedman reports: \"On Thursday, lawyers for Roger Stone, whose travel is restricted ahead of his November trial on obstruction of justice and perjury charges, requested a judge's permission to visit Tennessee and Illinois 'for business opportunities.' ... In a Facebook post, the club said Stone will judge dancers alongside Kristin Davis, who is known as the 'Manhattan Madam' for her role running a high-end prostitution ring in New York City in the early 2000s. Stone has previously employed Davis, and they are close friends. ... Last week, he launched a 'Family Support Fund' to seek donations to cover 'rent, food, medical expenses, insurance, gasoline, and the most basic of living expenses' for him and his wife. Strip-club appearance fees may be an emerging source of income for the cash-strapped dirty trickster.\"\n\n-- Education Secretary Betsy DeVos used her personal email to conduct government business. Laura Meckler reports: \"The report found fewer than 100 emails sent or received to personal accounts between Jan. 20, 2017 ... and April 10, 2018. It said most messages were in the first six months of 2017, from a single writer offering advice on potential candidates for agency positions. The writer, who was not identified, also included other department employees on his or her messages, using their official government email addresses. ... The report also flagged the department's failure to produce emails from DeVos's private accounts in response to one request under the Freedom of Information Act. ... A department spokeswoman, Liz Hill, did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but she said on Twitter that any coverage of the matter was overblown.\"\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Iran has quadrupled its uranium-enrichment production capacity. The AP's Nasser Karimi and Jon Gambrell report: \"Iranian officials made a point to stress that the uranium would be enriched only to the 3.67% limit set under the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, making it usable for a power plant but far below what's needed for an atomic weapon. But by increasing production, Iran soon will exceed the stockpile limitations set by the accord. Tehran has set a July 7 deadline for Europe to set new terms for the deal, or it will enrich closer to weapons-grade levels in a Middle East already on edge.\"\n\n-- Trump said there's \"no indication\" of threatening actions by Tehran, playing down tensions with Iran. Felicia Sonmez reports: \"'We have no indication that anything's happened or will happen, but if it does, it will be met, obviously, with great force. We will have no choice,' [he said]. Trump's description of Iran's recent actions stood somewhat in contrast with the portrayal given by his national security team. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in a tweet earlier Monday that Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, had warned about 'escalating tensions' with Iran.\"\n\n-- Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif dismissed Trump's \"genocidal taunts.\" From the BBC: \"Mr Zarif said the US president should look to history. 'Iranians have stood tall for millennia while aggressors all gone... Try respect - it works!' ... Writing on Twitter on Monday, Iran's foreign minister said the US president was being 'goaded' by what he called the 'B Team' -- a reference to [Bolton], Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.\"\n\n-- Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that, while he favors talks and diplomacy, the current conditions do not allow for them. \"Today's situation is not suitable for talks and our choice is resistance only,\" the Iranian state news agency IRNA quoted Rouhani as saying. (Reuters)\n\n-- Another senior Iranian official called Trump a \"crazy president\" while slamming his mixed messages over any potential conflict. CNN's Nicole Gaouette reports: \"Iran's director of foreign affairs for the country's parliament, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian ... pointed to the US leader's ongoing campaign to strangle Iran's economy on the one hand and his requests for Iran to talk on the other. 'In his mind, Trump thinks he has a gun to Iran's head with sanctions and he is trying to shut down our economy,' Amir-Abdollahian told CNN's Fred Pleitgen. 'This is all in his imagination. Now he wants us to call him? This is a crazy president!'\"\n\n-- Swamp watch: The Libyan National Army, a militia group led by Khalifa Haftar, has hired its own Washington lobbyist. From Politico's Theodoric Meyer: \"Stephen Payne and Brian Ettinger of Linden Government Solutions will lobby in Washington on behalf of Haftar's forces as well as assist with 'international coalition building' and public relations. ... The one-year contract, which will be filed with the Justice Department, is worth $2 million.

And the candidates are in the same position as the rest of the country, not to mention the Murdoch family who controls the network, and even the president of the United States: What to do about Fox News? ... Trump does his best to support the Fox News hosts who support him. ... Meanwhile, Democratic candidates have taken very different approaches to the network. In March, the Democratic National Committee barred Fox News from hosting a Democratic primary. But many candidates, such as [Pete] Buttigieg, are breaking from the party line and going on Fox, each in his or her own way.\"\n\n-- A host of \"Fox & Friends\" slammed Buttigieg for criticizing Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham. The Times's Michael M. Grynbaum reports: \"Mr. Buttigieg's hourlong appearance spawned headlines, solid ratings, and kudos from liberals pleased to see the South Bend, Ind., mayor calling out Fox News pundits on their own network. The reaction was chillier among some of the network's core conservative viewers ... On Monday's 'Fox & Friends,' the host Brian Kilmeade scolded Mr. Buttigieg for criticizing his fellow commentators. ... 'Don't hop on our channel and continue to put down the other hosts on the channel,' Mr. Kilmeade said. 'If you feel that negative about it, don't come. For him to go out there and take shots on our prime-time lineup, without going on our prime-time lineup, shows to me absolutely no courage.'\"\n\n-- Black voters say they are struggling with cynicism toward the field of candidates after they've been let down so many times. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: \"Interviews with dozens of black voters in three competitive states -- Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina -- found deep divisions beneath that party loyalty about the best way to wield the power they bring to the ballot box, and a sense that past political engagement has been met with broken promises and little progress for struggling communities. In addition to regional and generational divides, voters' perceptions are further muddied by the fact that there are nearly two dozen major candidates, including six women and two black senators -- minority candidates who have to contend with the disappointment of some black voters who feel the first black president didn't do enough for them.\"\n\n-- Walmart employees brought a surprise guest to their company's annual meeting as they continue fighting for higher wages and better benefits: Bernie Sanders. Abha Bhattarai reports: \"The presidential candidate, who has repeatedly called on Walmart to improve its working conditions, is heading to Bentonville, Ark., on June 5 to introduce a shareholders' proposal that would give hourly Walmart workers a seat on the company's board. 'These workers need and deserve a seat at the table,' Sanders (I-Vt.) told The Washington Post.

It's easy to assume that the solution is to wall ourselves off, to draw apart. If, ultimately, other people pose the greatest threat to my person and my property, perhaps I should distance myself from them. Jewish legal sources -- including the Mishnah, and the later rabbinic elaborations in the Talmud -- have a lot to say about restitution for damages. Nowhere, however, does Jewish law recommend living in isolation. Community is essential to being a Jew, because community is essential to being a human. We need one another. When we live in close proximity, we will inevitably cause damage to our neighbors, whether with our words or our actions, and we lay ourselves open to being damaged in turn.

Farmers who had been hiding from law enforcement for years were asked to present themselves to authorities and to comply with new commercial-growing ordinances. ... Before legalization, people grew cannabis however they could and developed methods to avoid getting caught by law enforcement. Regulation demands a different set of skills. Instead of burning records, farmers must now practice accounting. ... Legalization brings with it the costs of taxes, permitting, compliance, and new competitors. It has also occasioned a rapid drop in price. Now Humboldt County is experiencing not only an economic crisis but also an existential one. What happens to a group of people whose anti-government ethos was sustained by an illegal plant that is now the most regulated crop in California?\"\n\n-- The Economist, \"Europe's hard-right is pitching voters a contradictory fantasy\": \"Europe's right-wing populists will take votes off an array of mainstream rivals at next weekend's election to the European Parliament. But what exactly do they want? To that, the nationalists provided answers of sorts at their big end-of-campaign rally in Milan's Piazza del Duomo today. Under sporadic rain showers in the shadow of the city's cathedral, right-populist leaders from eleven EU countries demanded a 'revolution' to overthrow the existing order in Brussels and build a 'Europe of nations'. They were confident. They were loud. They reaped the applause of thousands of supporters of Italy's hard-right Lega, the host party, gathered in the square waving giant flags in the drizzle.

Laura Vozzella reports: \"While a spate of states have recently made access to abortion more difficult, advocates in Virginia are trying to make it easier. The case is being heard in an election year when Republicans are trying to hold onto their razor-thin control of the legislature and when abortion politics -- dormant for the past few cycles -- probably will be prominent. ... The case in federal court in Richmond comes after Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio banned abortions after doctors can detect a fetal heartbeat ... The lawsuit was brought by a coalition of abortion rights groups, including the Center for Reproductive Rights, the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood and several abortion clinics across the state. The state Department of Health and the office of Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D) are defending the rules. The case has put Herring in an awkward position as both an advocate for abortion rights and the state official tasked with defending Virginia law. He did not formally recuse his office from the case but hired a private firm, Hirschler Law, saying he did not have enough staff to handle it.\"\n\n-- A series of shootings in Columbia Heights led to a school lockdown. Peter Hermann reports: \"Liane Carrascoso was headed to pick up her 5-year-old son at Harriet Tubman Elementary School in Columbia Heights on Friday when she saw police officers urgently closing down nearby streets. Two men had been shot less than 400 feet from the school's front door, and officers were searching for three possible shooters.

He said he had used a milkshake simply because it had been in his hand at the time. The moment was captured on video and quickly spread on social media. A day later, in a different city in northern England, Mr. Robinson was again splattered with milkshake.\n\nCarl Benjamin, a member of the right-wing U.K. Independence Party who is under investigation about a comment he made on Twitter regarding raping a female Labour lawmaker, was later targeted. He has been hit with four separate milkshake attacks so far.\n\nOther attacks on the far right have been encouraged on social media with the hashtag #SplashTheFash. The practice has prompted an angry backlash from some rightists.\n\n\"Just to be clear, anyone that comes at me with a milkshake will need the straw to eat their meals for the next few months,\" Mark Meechan, another UKIP candidate, wrote on Twitter this month.\n\nThe attacks have also caught the eye of the police. In preparation for a weekend rally for Mr. Farage in Edinburgh, officers have asked McDonald's to briefly stop selling milkshakes on Saturday, a spokeswoman for the fast food chain said.\n\nBut why milkshakes?\n\nKevin Featherstone, a professor of European politics at the London School of Economics, said in an email that the strong visual impact was important.\n\n\"The recipient looks ridiculous and it debunks the politician's aura,\" he said. \"The attacker is saying, 'You don't represent me, with your darker side of politics.' \"\n\nBenjamin Franks, a senior lecturer of social and political philosophy at the university of Glasgow, said in an email that, while he doubted that the original dousing had been planned, the practice had quickly taken off.\n\n\"I think it latterly caught the imagination of anti-fascist protesters because, as there is an abundance of fast food outlets in U.K. cities, it is easily available and -- at least at first -- could be carried without raising suspicion,\" he said.\n\nMilk has been adopted by some white supremacists as a symbol of their movement, but Mr. Franks said that the protesters' actions had effectively turned that notion on its head.\n\n\"It turns a symbol used by the alt right -- milk -- to symbolize 'whiteness' and to mock ethnic groups with a greater predisposition to lactose intolerance, into an image of dramatic opposition,\" Mr. Franks said.\n\nUnlike some of the other politicians targeted, Mr. Farage, who has spent 20 years as a member of the European Parliament, is one of the most recognizable faces in the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union. The Brexit Party is currently leading the polls in Britain for the elections to the European Parliament.\n\nAfter he was doused, Mr. Farage blamed \"radicalized\" Britons who disagreed with Brexit for making normal campaigning impossible.\n\nAnd many have argued that attacking a candidate with food created an atmosphere of aggression and was an inadequate response to the polarizing politics of Mr. Farage.\n\nBrendan Cox, the husband of Jo Cox -- a member of the British Parliament who was killed in a 2016 attack -- said that, while he disagreed with Mr. Farage's politics and his \"willingness to pander to hatred,\" throwing milkshakes was not the answer.\n\n\"I don't think throwing stuff at politicians you disagree with is a good idea,\" he wrote on Twitter, adding that it normalized violence and intimidation.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "iliana_magra@nytimes.com", "name": "Iliana Magra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/21/world/21mikshake/21mikshake-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800026", "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 296142600}, {"uri": "1141390157", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "12:06:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T12:06:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5254902243614197, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-finance-202/2019/05/21/the-finance-202-democrats-probing-trump-deutsche-bank-see-new-momentum/5ce2dd25a7a0a435cff8c0ea/", "title": "Analysis | The Finance 202: Democrats probing Trump, Deutsche Bank see new momentum", "body": "Congressional Democrats -- with new momentum in their legal fight to investigate President Trump's conduct and records -- are pressing Deutsche Bank for more information on a report that the firm ignored red flags about suspicious activity from the Trump and Kushner organizations. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner is now a senior White House adviser.\n\nThe development brings even more political heat to the only major financial firm willing to bank Trump over the past two decades as he suffered a series of bankruptcies and defaults -- and which still holds $300 million in outstanding debt from the now-president. Deutsche Bank also faced enormous fines -- $700 million in 2017 alone -- for money laundering and misconduct on behalf of clients. Its shares hit a record low on Monday.\n\nDemocrats on the Senate Banking Committee plan to press the issue with federal financial regulators at a hearing today. Ohio's Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the panel, and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) set the stage in a Monday letter to Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing asking for details about events described in a New York Times report from Sunday.\n\nThat story alleges that over 2016 and 2017, Deutsche's in-house anti-money-laundering experts recommended passing suspicious transactions involving Trump and Kushner-controlled entities along to the Treasury Department for further investigation. But executives in the bank's private wealth management division buried the reports instead.\n\nBrown plans to lead off his questioning today of the Treasury Department's top financial crimes enforcer and the FBI's section chief for financial crimes by highlighting the report.\n\n\"We need to get to the bottom of what happened here,\" Brown will say, according to a copy of his opening statement shared with The Finance 202. \"Everyone has to follow anti-money laundering laws and rules -- you don't get an exemption if you have a rich and powerful client. And we have to hold financial institutions accountable if they break the rules.\"\n\nAnd House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who along with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) last month subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for records relating to its extensive dealings with Trump, did not have a comment by press time.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have some wind at their backs as they press their case. A federal judge on Monday blocked Trump's bid to kill another House subpoena -- this one to his accounting firm, Mazars USA, for years of his financial records. In a forceful ruling, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta wrote it is \"not for the court to question whether the [House Oversight and Reform] Committee's actions are truly motivated by political considerations,\" and declined a request from Trump's lawyers to stay his order for more than seven days.\n\nTrump criticized the ruling:\n\nA federal judge in Manhattan could follow suit Wednesday when he holds a hearing on a similar attempt by the Trump team to block House subpoenas of Deutsche Bank and Capital One. Trump's lawyers have made the same argument there that fell short in the Mazars case: That Democratic lawmakers behind the document demands are motivated by improper political considerations.\n\n(Still, House Democratic leaders are divided over how, broadly, to approach attempting to hold Trump to account. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) faced down a number of her lieutenants eager to begin impeachment proceedings in a heated Monday night meeting, after the White House blocked former counsel Don McGahn from testifying to the House.)\n\nThe New York Times report prompted an angry response from Trump on Monday -- but not over the story's central claim that Deutsche Bank overlooked potentially shady transactions involving Trump entities. He bristled rather at the story's statement that the German bank has been the only major financial firm willing to extend him credit:\n\nThe New York Times reporter who wrote the Deutsche Bank piece challenged Trump's claim:\n\nTrump's tweet thread belongs to a tradition of defensive comments about his net worth, as The Post's Catherine Rampell points out. \"One theory is that, maybe, if Trump's tax returns or other financial records become public, his supporters would learn that he's not nearly as rich as he says,\" she writes. \"Another is that his finances are not exactly on the up and up. Of course, both explanations could be true.\"\n\nFor its part, Deutsche Bank released a statement Monday denying the Times report. \"At no time was an investigator prevented from escalating activity identified as potentially suspicious. Furthermore, suggestion that anyone was reassigned or fired in an effort to quash concerns relating to any client is categorically false,\" the bank said.\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that the whistleblower at the heart of the Times story never made the first claim the denial addresses. Rather, she says, she presented her best case for submitting a report to Treasury on the suspicious activity she uncovered, but senior executives with the bank's private banking division decided against her recommendation.\n\nNow, Congressional Democrats intend to pick up where those executives left off.\n\n-- Powell raises concern about business debt. The WSJ's Nick Timiraos and Andrew Ackerman: \"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said financial regulators must take seriously potential dangers that rising levels of business debt pose to the U.S. economy but said some comparisons to last decade's subprime-mortgage bubble overstate the risks... Views about the risks from rising corporate borrowing 'range from \"This is a return to the subprime-mortgage crisis\" to \"Nothing to worry about here,\"' said Mr. Powell. 'At the moment, the truth is likely somewhere in the middle.'\"\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\n-- China talks stall: Both the U.S. and China appear to be digging in for a prolonged trade war. To review: Since Trump and his administration accused China of backing away from a deal, the United States has doubled tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports; China has promised to retaliate with tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. goods by June 1; the United States is considering imposing tariffs on all remaining approximately $300 billion in Chinese imports not currently taxed; and at the end of last week, it sought to blacklist Huawei, one of China's leading technology companies. Meanwhile, the promise of talks have fizzled.\n\nDavid Dollar, senior fellow in the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution, broke down for Brent why he thinks the two sides are still so far away from a deal.\n\n... But while prospects with China sour, USMCA talks are looking slightly more promising. Trump announced on Friday that the United States would lift its steel and aluminum tariffs, which Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) had said was necessary before the Senate Finance Committee that he chairs moved forward on the New NAFTA.\n\n-- Justice Department reportedly leaning against T-Mobile takeover: \"The Justice Department is leaning against approving T-Mobile U.S. Inc.'s proposed takeover of Sprint Corp., according to a person familiar with the review, even after the companies won the backing of the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission,\" Bloomberg News's David McLaughlin reports.\n\n\"Opposition to the deal by the Justice Department's antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, would mark a rare break with the FCC. The two agencies work side by side on merger reviews and typically emerge on the same page about whether to approve deals.\"\n\n-- Ford to cut 10 percent of global workforce: \"Ford Motor Co. will cut roughly 10 percent of its global salaried staff by August as part of a companywide \"redesign,\" the company told employees Monday,\" my colleague Rachel Siegel reports. \"The move will eliminate 7,000 white-collar jobs and save the U.S. auto giant about $600 million a year.\"\n\n\"The cuts represent the latest phase of Ford's global restructuring, meant to make the company more agile and less bureaucratic in the face of industry tumult that has forced carmakers to pivot away from sedans and shutter plants nationwide.\"\n\n-- Top four congressional leaders head to the White House: \"The four top party leaders will meet on Tuesday morning to begin talks on a potential deal to raise the budget caps, as well as a possible boost to the debt ceiling, according to multiple sources, although any agreement will be hard to reach,\" Politico's John Bresnahan and Heather Caygle report. \"Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will attend the session, as well as their top aides.\"\n\n\"Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Acting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will take the lead for the Trump administration in the negotiations, the sources added. Without action by Congress and the White House, the Pentagon faces a cut of $71 billion under current law, while domestic programs would be slashed $55 billion.\"\n\n-- Harris announces gender pay gap plan: \"Senator Kamala Harris of California on Monday announced a proposal to close the gender wage gap by requiring larger companies to certify that men and women are paid equally, in an effort to combat wage discrimination on a federal level,\" the New York Times's Astead W. Herndon reports.\n\n\"Unlike previous federal legislation regarding the pay gap, which asked workers to report or sue their employer if discrepancies were suspected, Ms. Harris's plan would proactively force companies with 100 or more employees to obtain an \"equal pay certification\" every two years, showing that they were paying men and women the same for analogous work, her campaign said.\"\n\n-- Crowley, Daschle join cannabis company board: \"Northern Swan Holdings Inc., an investment firm betting on hemp and marijuana cultivation in Colombia, has enlisted a pair of former Democratic lawmakers as it tries to navigate complicated cannabis regulations around the globe,\" Bloomberg News's Craig Giammona reports. \"Joe Crowley, a former high-ranking New York congressman who lost a primary to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last year, and Tom Daschle, a former U.S. Senate majority leader from South Dakota, have joined Northern Swan's advisory board, the latest politicians to jump into the legal cannabis industry.\"\n\n-- Regulators leave almost half their fines uncollected. WSJ's Dave Michaels: \"Wall Street watchdogs often tout the fines they levy on alleged wrongdoers. Yet much of that money is never collected. The Securities and Exchange Commission over five fiscal years that ended in September 2018 took in 55% of the $20 billion in enforcement fines set through settlements or court judgments, according to agency statistics. During the prior five years, from 2009 through 2013, the SEC collected on 60% of $14.6 billion...\n\n\"The SEC has struggled for years to get defendants to pay their fines, although some are almost certain to avoid payment forever... The SEC's challenge is that, like companies that are owed money, it doesn't have the right to seize a debtor's property or assets to extract payment. Instead, it relies on a time-consuming and litigious process of filing liens against defendants or going to court to seek contempt orders.\"\n\nBrexit Party Leader Nigel Farage was doused in milkshake while trying to campaign", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/7927c55249ae4fc7f10dee4f822a2722-4850-3233-70-8-J4J5H7S4UEI6TBBNPU7NP2ZZK4.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4798677", "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 296136360}, {"uri": "1141352956", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "11:21:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T11:21:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/21/why-we-google-moving-other-countries-when-party-we-dont-like-wins/", "title": "Analysis | Why we google moving to other countries when the party we don't like wins", "body": "By Rick Noack Rick Noack Foreign affairs reporter focusing on Europe and international security May 21 at 6:58 AM\n\nLate on Saturday came the announcement that crushed Australian liberals' dreams of returning to power. Defying all expectations and polls, the center-right administration of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison managed to hold onto power, echoing the surprise victory of President Trump in 2016.\n\nBeyond the unreliability of polls, there was another echo of 2016.\n\nAfter Trump's victory, disappointed Democrats eager to leave the country crashed the Canadian immigration website.\n\nAlmost three years on, the same could be observed on the other side of the world on Sunday, hours after the conservative win in Australia. In New Zealand, where Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has managed to position herself as a global liberal role model despite governing a country with a population smaller than London's, government servers registered a surge in interest to migrate there over the weekend.\n\nThe site had more than 11,000 visitors on Sunday, compared to less than 3,000 visitors seven days earlier, according to officials. Google analytics showed a surge in related search queries in Australia.\n\nThose seeking a way out were in luck, as migrating to New Zealand isn't much more difficult for Australians than it is for Americans to go to Europe on vacation. \"If you are a citizen or permanent resident of Australia you don't need to apply for a visa to live and work in New Zealand,\" the country's immigration website states.\n\nThis almost certainly wasn't news to most Australians.\n\nIt also is unlikely that the surge in traffic will indeed translate into a substantial rise in Australians moving to New Zealand, as the U.S. elections have previously proved: Whereas announcing the imminent departure for Canada on social media was a largely effortless move for many, actually moving to Canada was not as big of a trend. Rather than causing a surge in U.S. migrants to Canada, the Trump victory only resulted in a temporary uptick.\n\nInformation snippets, such as one day of search traffic, shouldn't be overinterpreted.\n\nAnother cautionary tale was Britons' rush to google \"What is the E. U.?,\" hours after the country had voted to leave the European Union. To Brexit's opponents, the anecdote served as evidence that few supporters of leaving the E.U. knew what they were getting themselves into at the time of the vote. But British E.U. opponents would have cautioned that a few thousands of Britons taking to Google may make for an online trend, but that it was at best a nonrepresentative, minor detail -- and at worst a misleading effort to portray Brexit voters as unintelligent and unprepared.\n\nThe Internet, those critics maintained, had provided E.U. supporters with the tale they wanted to hear.\n\nWhile temporary spikes in online search behavior provide limited insights, the debate they cause can often be more telling.\n\nIn that context, last weekend's New Zealand immigration episode may be less an indication of a wave of Australians moving to New Zealand, and more a metaphorical expression of the extent of liberal Australians' frustration with their government -- and their hopes for a Jacinda Ardern-style challenger.\n\nThe differences between Morrison and Ardern could hardly be more pronounced.\n\nMorrison has portrayed himself as a defender of the country's influential coal industry and has resisted calls to cut emissions more significantly. He has largely shrugged off climate action protests.\n\nGiven that Australia's agricultural heartland -- long a conservative stronghold -- is now the most severely affected by climate change-induced droughts, liberals expected a growing momentum for their anti-coal calls there. But so far, few farmers see climate change as the reason for the record droughts that are threatening their livelihoods, even as researchers maintain that Australia has already heated up by 1 degree Celsius over the last century.\n\nIn comparison, liberal Ardern has pursued a more far reaching climate change policy, banning all new offshore oil exploration last spring as part of an effort to make the country carbon neutral.\n\nWhereas Ardern's government has just rolled out the world's first so-called well-being budget -- focused on improving citizens' happiness instead of growing GDP -- Australia's conservatives mostly ran on the promise to preserve economic growth. The liberal opposition Labor Party had campaigned for a more New Zealand-style approach, favoring high taxes to address social inequality.\n\nAnother difference between the two parties was their stance on immigration, with the conservatives pursuing tougher policies, including continuing to hold refugees in offshore centers, where several people tried to commit suicide after Saturday's election result was announced, according to AFP.\n\nUnable to elect a government that vowed to change course, some of Australia's liberals instead began to explore options to become migrants themselves on Sunday.\n\nWhile New Zealand officials said they did not expect most of them to be serious, the 2020 U.S. elections could become another test of whether Democrats are willing to keep living in a country run by a president they deem abhor.\n\n'Complete shock': Australia's prime minister holds onto power, defying election predictions\n\n10 key lessons from Australia's poll-defying election results", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AHyzfOAltqHwISETJWQQBGOIG7s=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WOOTH2DZ5QI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 296133660}, {"uri": "1141282981", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "09:49:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T09:49:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/realestate/visas-residency-passports-property-investment.html", "title": "Special Incentive for Property Buyers: A Foreign Passport", "body": "When Natalia Yavorska and her husband first considered buying a holiday retreat somewhere warmer than their Ukrainian homeland, they were drawn to the Canary Islands.\n\nA vacation to the Spanish archipelago in 2012 left them eyeing land on the southwest coast of the island of Tenerife, and while the initial attractions were the golf courses and ocean views, the deal was sealed by a special extra that came with their purchase.\n\n\"The fact that we could get a Spanish residence visa from buying real estate was very important, and that made it an easy decision,\" said Ms. Yavorska, a 60-year-old former banker from a town near Kiev.\n\nThat \"golden visa\" carried the right to eventually apply for a Spanish, and therefore European Union, passport, the kind of bonus that is luring a growing number of investors to high-end real estate.\n\nOnce seen as a slightly shady practice, the business of dangling visas and citizenship in front of wealthy investors has become a more common, and in some cases hugely successful, marketing strategy.\n\nMs. Yavorska and her husband, Alexander Yavorski, who own a pharmaceutical import business in Ukraine, were worried about political stability at home and saw the right to live in the European Union as \"a type of insurance.\"\n\n\"Something can always happen between Russia and Ukraine, so if you have the chance to have a visa or a second passport sitting in your drawer, you would be stupid not to take it,\" she said.\n\nSo far, at least 14 countries have programs that offer visas or passports to foreigners who buy real estate, according to research by Henley & Partners, a British-based law firm that specializes in helping people looking such programs, and The New York Times. Montenegro will soon become the 15th, and the British overseas territory of Anguilla is planning to follow suit.\n\nMany more countries, including the United States and 20 of the 28 European Union members, are offering residence visas, which can often lead to passports, to foreigners willing to invest in nonproperty business ventures. These countries believe the investments will bolster their economies.\n\nOther countries, led by small Caribbean island nations and Vanuatu, in the South Pacific, are happy to simply sell a passport for as little as $100,000.\n\nAnalysts say that offers of passports and residency have become a big business, attracting an estimated $20 billion a year in investment.\n\nThat approach is transforming the upper end of real estate markets and reshaping the finances of some of the smaller countries, pumping billions of dollars into economies that are desperate for the funds.\n\nAt the same time, the practice is raising fears in the European Parliament and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which works to promote economic growth worldwide. They worry that the programs could assist money laundering, tax evasion and the free movement of criminals and terrorists, as well as allow wealthy Russians, Iranians and Syrians to skirt economic sanctions.\n\nThere are eight countries -- five small Caribbean states, Turkey and, in the European Union, Cyprus and Malta -- that will hand over passports to property buyers, who are generally required to spend little, if any, time within their borders.\n\nIn December, Brazil joined Dubai, which is part of the United Arab Emirates, and six European nations -- Cyprus, Greece, Latvia, Malta, Portugal and Spain -- in extending residence visas to property buyers.\n\nThe rules vary for converting those visas into passports.\n\nPortugal requires a waiting period of five years, during which the applicant needs to spend just one week a year in the country. Spain and Latvia insist on a 10-year wait. The Latvians and Greeks require difficult language tests and several years of actually living in the country, and the Latvians insist that applicants learn the national anthem. Dubai almost never grants United Arab Emirates citizenship to foreigners.\n\nThe picky passport shopper needs to consider price, each country's tax system and the speed of its bureaucracy: Dominica is the fastest to hand over a passport, and Turkey the slowest among nations that go straight to a passport.\n\nPassport shoppers also need to consider how much time a nation requires them to spend within its borders, and how many other countries will grant them visa-free access with their new passports. Grenada, for instance, offers passports that have visa-free access to both China and Russia.\n\nWealthy Chinese are by far the biggest buyers of both visas and passports, followed by Russians, experts say. There is also growing interest among French citizens eager to avoid high income taxes and Britons desperate to maintain their European Union membership when or if their country leaves the bloc.\n\n\"I think there will be a huge amount of activity once we know what is actually happening with Brexit,\" said Penny Mosgrove, the chief executive of the upmarket real estate agency Quintessentially Estates.\n\nAmericans are interested, too. In the five years to April 2018, 4,327 United States citizens received golden visas in Spain alone. Experts say there are two reasons for Americans' appetite for new passports and residency visas.\n\nOne is that the United States and Eritrea are the only countries that tax the worldwide earnings of their citizens even if they live abroad.\n\nAlex Marino, who heads one of the largest expatriation legal practices in the world for Moodys Gartner Tax Law, said that in the final quarter of 2016, when Donald J. Trump was elected president, there was a record spike in the number of Americans renouncing their United States citizenship. But the biggest driving force by far, he said, \"is finances and taxes, rather than politics.\"\n\nPeter Vincent, a former senior prosecutor in the Obama administration who now oversees security liaison for Henley & Partners, the law firm, said another factor was personal security.\n\n\"There are some places in the world where if your taxi or bus gets pulled up and you are carrying a U.S. passport, that is a death warrant,\" he said, \"so people prefer to have a second passport for safety reasons.\"\n\nKnight Frank, a British real estate consulting firm that operates globally, estimated late last year that 36 percent of people with more than $30 million in net assets had second passports, up from 34 percent a year earlier.\n\nChristian H. K\u00e4lin, the Swiss-born lawyer who leads the British-based Henley & Partners, said the trend was also growing among the less wealthy.\n\nFor those seeking residency visas or passports, the firm charges fees that start at about 20,000 euros, or $22,500, and can reach \u20ac500,000 for complicated programs like that of Austria, which requires nonproperty investments of at least \u20ac10 million. The firm has grown rapidly over the past decade, expanding to 30 offices around the world.\n\nCharlie Smith, European adviser at the New York company Concierge Auctions, which specializes in properties valued at more than $2 million, said the lure of a visa is an important marketing tool. Mr. Smith used a recent tour of China and Singapore to drum up interest in the auction of the nine-bedroom Villa San Lorenzo in Quinta do Lago, a gated community in the Algarve region of Portugal. The property was previously listed for \u20ac20 million.\n\nMr. Smith said that he had \"specifically targeted\" his customer databases in China with the property because China is the strongest market for Portugal's golden visa program. In the 12 months ended in February, 4,159 Chinese used the program, a 30 percent increase over the previous year and well ahead of second-place Brazil, with 695 investors.\n\nSome developers are making the residency programs an integral part of their plans, shaping their prices and timelines around the best way to qualify for visas. When the high-end property consulting firm Athena Advisers ran a promotion for several Portuguese developments at its London offices in March, it flew in developers from Lisbon to pitch their projects, and lawyers to explain how the investments could qualify for the golden visa program.\n\nOver red wine and finger food, an audience of about 20 potential buyers asked questions that focused as much on the golden visas as on the likely rental and investment returns of the projects.\n\nS\u00e9rgio Ferreira, the chief executive of the developer Coporgest, explained how a 43-apartment project in central Lisbon had been structured to take maximum advantage of the visa system.\n\nThe project, SottoMayor Premium, involves the renovation of a 19th-century building so buyers can qualify for a \u20ac350,000 threshold, rather than the normal minimum investment of \u20ac500,000.\n\nUnusually, some sales of the apartments, which are priced from \u20ac420,000 to \u20ac1.6 million, have been packaged as interest-paying special-purpose vehicles designed with the visa in mind.\n\nAs soon as an investor makes an initial payment of \u20ac350,000, the clock starts on the five-year waiting period for a full passport, even though the apartment might not be completed for another two or three years.\n\nJo\u00e3o Cunha Vaz, a senior partner with the law firm Edge, briefed Athena's clients on the visa program and several tax-reducing programs offered by Portugal, including the \"non-habitual resident\" option, which offers a decade of tax breaks and has been attracting French citizens and other foreigners.\n\nAnother country that has recently developed a visa program is Brazil, which in the past saw many of its citizens moving money abroad to obtain second passports. Now, it is trying to reverse the trend.\n\nEdouard Barthelemy, Athena's manager in Rio de Janeiro, says the program is too new to have yielded results. But he is confident it will build interest in high-end properties.\n\nNot everyone is pleased with the growth of visa programs.\n\nCritics say that while countries like Cyprus and Malta are reaping the benefits of handing out passports, what they are really offering is the right to live anywhere in the European Union. And they say such programs can attract shady characters.\n\nBut others say that getting visas through real estate transactions involves vetting for criminal records, for instance, which is a far more restrictive process than the scrutiny faced by the million people a year who are given European Union passports through marriage or the reuniting of family.\n\n\"Anyone who is a real security threat or a major criminal would not put themselves through that scrutiny -- they have other ways to get a passport or go where they want,\" said Mr. K\u00e4lin, of Henley & Partners.\n\nThere are tax advantages in having residence rights in countries like Antigua, Cyprus and Malta, which charge little income tax on offshore assets and do not require the investor to live in the country for any significant period.\n\nMr. K\u00e4lin was a key figure in turning the trade in passports and residency visas into an industry.\n\nSt. Kitts and Nevis became the first country to introduce a formal program of selling passports in 1984, the year after it won independence from Britain.\n\nMr. K\u00e4lin approached the government with an offer to revamp the program and then negotiated a visa-free access agreement for St. Kitts with the European Union's Schengen Area, a zone comprising 26 countries without passport controls.\n\nThat kind of access was on Natalia Yavorska's mind when she and her husband bought land on the Canary Islands. She found many visa applications \"a humiliating experience where they want fingerprints and medical tests and treat you like a refugee trying to sneak over the border.\"\n\n\"A passport with visa-free access to a lot of countries is just so much better,\" she said.\n\nAfter St. Kitts, Mr. K\u00e4lin's firm went on to advise Grenada and Antigua on how to design their programs, and it is now retained by Moldova, which sells passports for \u20ac140,000 rather than requiring property investment, and Malta.\n\n\"These programs have been hugely important for those countries,\" Mr. K\u00e4lin said. \"They have transformed the economy in St. Kitts, been very significant in Antigua and Malta and have helped to dig Cyprus out of an economic crisis.\"\n\nThe minimum investment under Spain's golden visa program is \u20ac500,000, which can be made up of one or more purchases.\n\nThe Yavorski family passed that easily by spending about \u20ac1 million for land where they built a three-bedroom villa overlooking a golf course and the ocean.\n\nMaria Moreno, the head of sales at Abama Luxury Residences, a Canary Islands developer, said golden visas have become a valuable marketing tool for projects such as hers, where the Yavorskis were the first buyers.\n\n\"About 25 percent of our buyers are from outside the E.U., mainly from Russia, Ukraine, Brazil and the U.S., and four out of five apply for golden visas,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_wilson@nytimes.com", "name": "Peter Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/25/world/25real-citizenship03-inyt/25real-citizenship03-inyt-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 296128140}, {"uri": "1141254061", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "09:10:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T09:10:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/europe-was-worried-russia-would-mess-with-its-elections-now-it-has-other-fears/2019/05/20/d0c18552-77f1-11e9-a7bf-c8a43b84ee31_story.html", "title": "Europe was worried Russia would mess with its elections.

(Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images) By Michael Birnbaum Michael Birnbaum Brussels bureau chief covering Europe May 21 at 5:00 AM\n\nBRUSSELS -- Days before crucial elections for the European Parliament, politicians, security services and social media companies that were bracing for an onslaught from Russia are surprised that, so far, they seem to have avoided one.\n\nLawmakers say they haven't seen what they once feared: a flood of hacked, embarrassing documents, or Twitter accounts calling for street protests that post only during Moscow business hours.\n\nThey are cautious about saying Russian meddling has been neutralized, especially since some far-right politicians welcome Kremlin help. Just this past weekend, Austrian Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache resigned after a video filmed in 2017 showed him to be receptive to politically motivated investments from Russia.\n\nBut the anxiety has shifted somewhat inward, as many of the disinformation tactics pioneered by Russia have been domesticated, replicated on both extremes of the political debate in Europe. Meanwhile, with President Trump and his allies embracing Europe's far-right leaders, centrists here also find themselves newly worried about the potentially distorting influence of the United States.\n\n\"It's not 2016. We are not seeing the automated, networked activity with an obvious Russian fingerprint across these elections,\" said Sasha Havlicek, head of London's Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which has been tracking online disinformation. \"What we're seeing much more of is coordinated, transnational far-right information operations.\"\n\nThe European Parliament has long been a haven for odd-duck politicians outside the mainstream, since few European citizens actually understand the role of the legislature and fewer still turn out to vote. That has left an opening for people who can command a passionate minority, like Nigel Farage, the Brexit campaigner who has lost seven elections for Britain's House of Commons but has been in the European Parliament since 1999.\n\nEuroskeptic politicians did well in the last election for the European legislature in 2014. But this week they are dreaming of an epochal shift -- a wave of enough lawmakers to form a blocking minority inside the body and bring the workings of the European Union to a halt.\n\nCentrist leaders figured that Russia wanted the same thing and that the Kremlin would pull out the stops to boost its sympathizers. European leaders commissioned reports about foreign meddling, enlisted intelligence services in efforts to be vigilant, and pushed social media companies to police their platforms. But the worst fears about Kremlin involvement have not manifested, officials and analysts said.\n\n\"We are not calm about everything,\" said Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics, whose Baltic nation has a large Russian-speaking population and is on the front lines of tensions with the Kremlin. \"We are trying to monitor each and every activity that could be suspicious.\"\n\nStill, he said, \"so far, there have not been alarms about something unusual.\"\n\nHe and others cautioned that it is challenging to monitor trends in real time across 28 E.U. nations, each with their own campaigns, being conducted in 24 official languages. And they said Russia has proved adept at adapting tactics to keep a low profile. But they said that if there was a major Russian effort to swing the elections toward specific parties or candidates, it was being conducted in a different enough manner from past cycles that they hadn't yet spotted it.\n\nRussia is still working openly to promote divisive political narratives within Europe. The Sputnik news agency has offered wall-to-wall coverage of the \"yellow vest\" protests that have shaken France. The German-language homepage of RT, formerly Russia Today, recently featured a banner debunking \"myths\" that the former West Germany was superior to Communist East Germany.\n\nFrance's \"yellow vest\" protests have been a favorite subject of Russian state media. (Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters)\n\nThere has also been apparent subterfuge: The E.U.'s official disinformation-busting team last month flagged an English- and German-language news portal with Russian fingerprints, including coding that showed videos had been posted from a computer folder named \"Anastasia\" in Cyrillic script.\n\nFacebook this month said it took down 16 Russian-linked accounts, four pages and one Instagram account that were targeting users in seven E.U. countries and Ukraine. But the scale of what's been identified is nothing compared with the past -- or with what the Europeans had anticipated.\n\nJana Kobzova, an adviser to the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity, said Moscow may have calculated that these elections weren't worth the bother.\n\n\"Russia has limited resources,\" she said. \"And if they already have people like Nigel Farage being elected, they don't need to help much.\"\n\nBut analysts say Europe also may have gotten better at thwarting Russian attempts to shake up its campaigns.\n\nEuropean politicians have grown savvy about protecting their communications and are less likely to fall for phishing attempts. Facebook has promised more openness about who is paying for political advertising in European elections. Twitter is moving faster to wipe automated bot accounts from its rolls. And citizens may also be more cautious about what they see online.\n\n\"Member states are much less ignorant than in 2016, and they're aware of the need to do something,\" Kobzova said.\n\nThe collective effort on the continent stands in contrast to the United States, where the discussion about Russian interference breaks along sharp partisan lines. After Trump spoke by phone to Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin earlier this month, he tweeted that they had talked not about election meddling but about the \"Russian Hoax.\"\n\nEuropeans, meanwhile, have been unsettled by how Trump, his envoys and ultraconservative U.S. activists might influence this week's elections. The fears about the United States are not as great as about Russia. But concerns have been growing.\n\nCentrist European politicians questioned whether President Trump hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban last week to give him an election boost. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMany centrist leaders in Europe saw a clear campaign message in the timing of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's visit to Washington last week. Trump said that Orban -- who has been hit with official E.U. proceedings for rule-of-law violations -- \"has done a tremendous job in so many different ways. Highly respected. Respected all over Europe. Probably, like me, a little bit controversial, but that's okay.\"\n\nAt the same time, some of Trump's envoys to Europe have been more overtly partisan than ambassadors from previous administrations. The U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, has slammed German leaders for their stance on migration, threatened them about a planned natural gas pipeline to Russia and praised German Chancellor Angela Merkel's rivals.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell has rattled his hosts by wading into the country's politics. (Hayoung Jeon/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nEuropean politicians have also been alarmed by money pouring in from ultraconservative U.S. social activists, who have paid for lobbying and activism on issues such as migration and same-sex marriage. An OpenDemocracy analysis of U.S. tax filings found that at least $50 million had flowed into Europe in the past decade -- a drop in the bucket by U.S. standards, but a significant cash flow in the lower-budget world of European politics.\n\nThat report prompted 38 European lawmakers to demand an E.U. investigation of money flows from the United States, looking at \"the threat posed by Christian fundamentalists\" and other \"nefarious outside influences.\"\n\nOne American influence who has been more marginal than anticipated is Stephen K. Bannon, Trump's onetime strategist, who made much ado about organizing Europe's far-right ahead of these elections.\n\nBannon has appeared alongside Italy's Matteo Salvini and France's Marine Le Pen. But his pre-election effort to supply sympathetic candidates with polling data and campaign advice was thwarted by campaign finance laws and a lack of interest from far-right leaders. Bannon now says he will try to build coalitions among the far-right politicians once they have stormed the Parliament.\n\nStephen K. Bannon has not gotten far with his effort to organize far-right European parties. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nFar-right parties in Europe haven't needed Bannon, or Russia, in part because some of their domestic supporters have mimicked Russia's strategy of promoting disinformation and amplifying it with automated accounts.\n\nAhead of Spanish national elections last month, Facebook took down three networks that appeared to be spreading disinformation automatically. Avaaz, the activist group that flagged the content, estimated that the networks had almost 1.7\u2009million followers. The pages shared doctored pictures of a left-wing leader giving a Nazi salute, made-up data about North African men being disproportionately responsible for rape cases in Spain and an inaccurate news item about \"Catalan separatists\" closing down children's cancer clinics in favor of Catalan embassies.\n\nSeparately, analysts have questioned whether automation may be playing a role in online support for the far-right Alternative for Germany party. In a sample of German online political content examined by research firm Alto Data Analytics, less than 1\u2009percent of the users generated 10\u2009percent of the posts, most of them in favor of Alternative for Germany. They acknowledge the difficulty of separating some automated activity from real users who are extremely enthusiastic.\n\n\"It is hard to tell, but I wouldn't want to underestimate European populistic right-wing communications strategies,\" said Judith Sargentini, a Dutch Green Left party member of the European Parliament and a foe of the far-right. \"If we were to start blaming this on Russia or the U.S., we would let all these people in Europe that are sending out these racist, bigoted messages be less responsible for their own acts.\"\n\nQuentin Ari\u00e8s contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nEurope's far-right says it is united.

Nationalists have gained ground across Europe, and as they head into the elections with a newly united front, the vote is being seen as the latest test of their influence. Polls suggest that populist parties could be positioned to make big gains.\n\nHere's a guide to the European Parliament elections, a notoriously confusing system made even more so by changing dynamics within the bloc.\n\nHow does the European Parliament work?\n\nVoters will elect the 751 members of the European Parliament to five-year terms, with the number of seats for each nation determined primarily by its population.\n\nEach country uses a slightly different process, with the uniting requirement that the number of seats won by political parties be roughly proportional to their share of the vote. Member nations must hold their elections no earlier than Thursday and no later than Sunday.\n\nThe system is relatively new -- the first elections were held just 40 years ago -- and it is still evolving.\n\nOnce elected, nearly all lawmakers organize into Pan-European groups -- there are currently eight -- along broad ideological lines. The most powerful group has long been the center-right European People's Party, a coalition that includes Germany's governing Christian Democrats and the Republicans, the leading opposition party in France.\n\nThe European Parliament approves or rejects legislation, establishes budgets and supervises a variety of institutions within the bloc. It also plays a crucial role in selecting the president of the European Commission; the current president, Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, whose term ends later this year, has said he will not be a candidate.\n\nBut the Parliament shares decision-making power with several other bodies, including the European Commission, whose members are appointed by national governments, and the European Council, representing governments of member states.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this makes for decision-making that is complicated at best, and made more so by being seen through different regional or ideological lenses.\n\n\"There is no single understanding of how the E.U. works,\" said Katjana Gattermann, an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam who studies perceptions of the European Union. \"In the 28 countries, politics are always interpreted a bit differently.\"\n\nHow is rising nationalism affecting the elections?\n\nWhile pro-Europe parties have long dominated the Parliament, a nationalist and populist movement gaining ground across the Continent has begun to make its mark on the European Union.\n\nMatteo Salvini, the powerful leader of the anti-immigrant League party in Italy, announced last month the formation of a new European alliance of populist and far-right parties, providing a formidable threat to the establishment.\n\nNationalist parties, which at first glance seem incompatible with a transnational body, hope to change the European Union from within, said Daphne Halikiopoulou, an associate professor at the University of Reading in Britain and an expert on nationalism.\n\nMr. Salvini, who serves as Italy's deputy prime minister and interior minister, and his allies advocate stronger borders, greater national autonomy and a weaker European Union. The governing parties in Poland and Hungary, though not part of his alliance, have similar views.\n\nDr. Halikiopoulou said these groups have widened their appeal because their style of nationalism focuses on an \"outsider\" defined in ideological terms.\n\n\"This makes them much more attractive to a broad range of social groups, giving them more political appeal,\" she said. \"These parties get support now from a broader range of voters. It's not just the white angry men of the past.\"\n\nGaining power at the European level can help these parties bolster their status at home, Dr. Halikiopoulou said. But their nationalist ideals could leave them unable to form a functioning group within the European Parliament, a necessary step for decision-making power.\n\n\"It might in the end be their Achilles heel,\" she said, \"because it prevents them, by definition, from forging successful alliances at the E.U. level.\"\n\nHow does Brexit factor in?\n\nBritain was scheduled to leave the European Union on March 29, so it did not plan on taking part in this election. But the government's failure to agree on a withdrawal deal forced it to postpone the departure -- requiring participation in the vote.\n\nOn Thursday, British voters will have the bizarre experience of electing 73 representatives to an institution that their nation is seeking to divorce.\n\nIn local elections this month, voters severely punished the governing Conservative Party for the Brexit gridlock, and they are expected to do it again in the European Parliament contests. Public opinion polls show the Conservatives in fourth place.\n\nThe biggest beneficiary is expected to be the new Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage, the divisive politician who became one of the loudest voices for the nation's withdrawal. It could win more than 30 percent of the vote, according to recent polls.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party is suffering, too, being punished by many supporters for its failure to fight to remain in the bloc. Firmly pro-Europe parties like the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the newly formed group Change UK are expected to make gains on Thursday.\n\nOnce Britain leaves the European Union, its representatives will vacate the European Parliament; 27 seats will be redistributed to the remaining member nations, with the other 46 seats being retired.\n\nAcross Europe, surveys show that support for the European Union is higher than ever, and parties that once toyed publicly with following Britain's lead rarely raise the notion of leaving the bloc.\n\n\"The idea of belonging to the E.U. is at its highest support at the moment, and at the same time you see these rising nationalists,\" Dr. Halikiopoulou said. \"But Brexit has been a deterrent and has shown other countries that the implementation is simply not worth it.\"\n\nWhy is voter turnout typically so low?\n\nVoter turnout has steadily declined since the first election in 1979, which saw 62 percent of eligible citizens take part. In 2014, 42.6 percent cast ballots, far below the average turnout for national elections across Europe.\n\nThis is due, in part, to European elections being widely viewed by voters -- and even by the politicians taking part -- as less important than national elections.\n\n\"From a European perspective, it's mainly the domestic policies that are seen as mattering,\" said Dr. Gattermann, who studies perceptions of the European Union. A lack of understanding about the institution also dampens turnout, she said, even though many policy decisions made at the European Parliament directly affect local policies.\n\nThis mentality also helps explain why smaller parties -- including some of the rising nationalist groups -- can gain ground at the European level while struggling to do so at home. Many citizens also use the European Parliament vote as a protest, believing that the stakes are lower.\n\n\"Its also a place for smaller and newer parties, or single-issue parties, to test out the waters in an election,\" Dr. Gattermann said.\n\nMatteo Salvini Announces New European Alliance of Far-Right PopulistsApril 8, 2019European Elections Will Gauge the Power of PopulismMay 19, 2019Nigel Farage, Brexit's Loudest Voice, Seizes Comeback ChanceMay 14, 2019", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "megan_specia@nytimes.com", "name": "Megan Specia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/20/world/xxeu-explainer1/merlin_153176205_2c568c53-06d8-41b7-bde2-36112db3170a-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4797814", "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 296122620}, {"uri": "1140934266", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-20", "time": "23:08:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-20T23:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5098039507865906, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/opinion/australia-election-climate-change.html", "title": "Opinion | An Electoral Brush Fire in Australia", "body": "It was another election that couldn't be lost until it was. Rived by years of infighting, Australia's conservative governing coalition was trailing in the polls. The opposition Labor Party's polls showed it all but certain of ousting Prime Minister Scott Morrison, and its action platform on climate change seemed bound to resonate in a country devastated by drought, heat waves, brush fires and the loss of its magnificent Great Barrier Reef to warming seas.\n\nOn Saturday, in another surprise of the sort that had stunned Americans and Britons, Australian voters handed Mr. Morrison what he called a \"miracle\" victory. His conservative Liberal-National coalition, sharply opposed to cutting down on carbon emissions and coal, is expected to take 77 seats, one more than enough for a majority.\n\nIn hindsight, there are many reasons Mr. Morrison defied predictions. One was his success in projecting himself as the average Joe, a rugby-loving, beer-drinking evangelical Christian in a baseball cap who peppered his speeches with folksy Australianisms and slogans like \"a fair go for those who have a go.\" Urban Australians rolled their eyes, but polls show that whatever they thought of his party, the larger pool of those Mr. Morrison called the \"quiet Australians\" -- a category similar to those who voted for Brexit or President Trump -- consistently favored him over the Labor Party's Bill Shorten.\n\nThe troubling message was that even on an island-continent where the ravages of climate change are there for all to see, especially after the hottest summer on record, invocations of economic stability, secure jobs, cuts to immigration and conservative family values trump the unknowns and costs of dealing with climate change.\n\nThe surprise result also appeared to reflect a recent tendency of pollsters to underestimate the strength of conservative candidates and causes. Benjamin Netanyahu's victory in Israel in 2015, and Britain's Brexit vote and Mr. Trump's election, both in 2016, confounded pollsters' and pundits' predictions and have caused considerable analysis and soul-searching in the world of survey research.\n\nThere are many possible explanations for these polling misses, from voters' lying to survey-takers or avoiding pollsters altogether, to faulty turnout models, to a tendency by polling companies to reinforce one another's findings, a phenomenon called \"herding.\" The industry is hard at work trying to correct these problems, and the generally accurate polling in the United States' 2018 congressional election was a good sign.\n\nLike other victorious conservative populists, including in the United States, Mr. Morrison had the advantage of an easier message: change is risky and expensive; leftist plans to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases will wreck the economy, which has grown without interruption for 28 years. In the final debate between the candidates, each was told to ask the other two questions. Mr. Shorten used both of his to promote Labor policies, which included tackling climate change and wide-ranging reforms; Mr. Morrison used his to attack Labor policies.\n\nThe conservative coalition made the cost of addressing climate change the dominant issue. One economic model cited by Labor estimated that the 45 percent reduction in carbon emissions would cost the economy 167,000 jobs and 264 billion Australian dollars ($181 billion). Mr. Morrison used the study to claim Australia could not afford its current programs to reduce emissions and invest in clean energy.\n\nIt is certainly discouraging that so many voters in a democratic society could choose to shut their eyes to the obvious and immediate danger of climate change. The election gave added evidence that climate wars have become an adjunct of the politics of grievance that have brought populists to power in America, Europe and elsewhere, and have rent electorates into bitterly opposed camps of urban and provincial, young and old, activist and cautious.\n\nBut Mr. Morrison's victory does not necessarily mean he will do nothing about greenhouse gases. The pressure to take action is certain to grow, especially from the young, who demonstrate a strong concern for the climate, and several candidates who pushed a climate-change agenda did win. (Alas, the government is likely to support a hugely contentious coal mine proposed in the northeastern state of Queensland, which would be among the world's largest if approved, but Labor gave mixed signals on what it would have done.)\n\nWhat the Australian election outcome revealed was the urgent need to broaden the message for reducing carbon emissions, and to separate it from the divisive culture wars afflicting Western democracies.\n\nMr. Morrison confounded the pundits with his victory. He could now confound them even more by showing that he is ready to lead Australia, a country where the ravages of man-made climate change are most evident, in fighting back. As the first director of Tourism Australia, Mr. Morrison approved the cheeky \"So where the bloody hell are you?\" advertising campaign. The next target of that Australian brashness should be the climate. Otherwise, a new generation of voters will be putting that question to him when the next election rolls around in three years' time.\n\nRelatedMore on Australia and climate change.Australia Wilts From Climate Change.

It's Cautious.", "body": "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Ahead of Australia's general election on Saturday, one party had campaigned on the idea that politics and the economy were rigged in favor of the elites. It attacked its opponent relentlessly for siding with the \"top end of town.\" It insisted that things needed to be shaken up to stop serving multinational corporations and vested interests. That party lost.\n\nThe results were surprising. The center-right coalition, led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, remained in power against the opposition Labor party, which had led in every poll for years. But aside from being an upset, the election here shared little in common with Donald Trump's 2016 victory, the Brexit referendum or other populist insurgencies around the world.\n\nThis was a campaign in which the politics of race, xenophobia and immigration played almost no part. (That's probably because of the atmosphere after terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March.) There was nothing in Mr. Morrison's election pitch, perhaps other than continued support for coal mining, that seemed particularly aimed at rousing right-wing voters. Even on climate change, a major election issue on which there was some distance between the parties, Mr. Morrison argued his party was acting sufficiently -- not dismissing it as some elite conspiracy. No, the lesson from Australia's election isn't that this country is right-wing but that it's conservative -- as in cautious.\n\nYou could, if you were being unkind, call Labor's platform populist. And in fairness, the moment seemed right for its agenda: A royal commission into Australia's banks recently revealed all manner of unethical practices and underwrote a public sense of disgust at corporate lawlessness. Stagnating wages following the decline of a mining boom have meant that many Australians are facing financial stress. House prices in the biggest cities have galloped wildly out of reach of many would-be first-time buyers.\n\nTo address these very real economic concerns, Labor put forward serious, bold policies on complex issues that it argued overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy, in particular tax breaks on investment properties and retirees' stock market dividends. It was probably the most ambitious set of reforms any party has taken to an election in a generation.\n\nThe coalition contrived to run without a significant policy agenda beyond offering tax cuts. Overwhelmingly, its campaign was a negative one, attacking Labor's platform as reckless and anti-aspirational. But this wasn't a populist message, either. In fact it's a message of contentedness and caution. Its fundamental assumption is that broadly speaking, the system works fine: Trickle-down economics brings prosperity, and to the extent things could be better, such as wages, the answer is patience and more of the same. Labor couldn't be trusted precisely because it wanted to shake things up.\n\nThat this argument delivered the coalition a stunning victory in what appeared to be an unwinnable election does not represent some new Australian political logic. Rather, it follows a well-established tradition and conventional wisdom: The Australian electorate is averse to big change.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the last time an opposition attempted a policy platform this bold was in 1993 and the result was the same, only with the parties reversed. At that time, Labor was in government, and the coalition managed to lose what is frequently described as \"the unlosable election.\" It is also no coincidence that Labor, which is Australia's party of reform, has been in power for only 29 of Australia's 74 postwar years. It also tends to come to power when a moment of crisis is brewing: world wars, the Great Depression, the global financial crisis.\n\nIn ordinary times, Australia votes for mild, slow change. Usually that gives power to the coalition, but even the coalition tests Australia's conservative temperament at its peril. The last time it lost power was in 2007 when it undertook sweeping labor reforms, which amounted to a significant attack on workers' rights and tilted the power balance hugely in favor of employers. Labor's problem this time proved to be that it tried too many big ideas at once.\n\nThus did Labor lose significantly in outer suburbs, including among several lower-income electorates. Perhaps the most underappreciated predictor here seems to be debt: Those seats that are experiencing heavy mortgage stress almost entirely swung sharply against Labor. That suggests that even though those voters might be financially stretched, they were spooked by Labor's proposed changes to tax policy, which were subject to a scare campaign warning that they would cause house prices to collapse.\n\nPerhaps that might have been countered had Labor run a better, more focused campaign. That post-mortem is now underway. Even so, the fact that Labor's narrative of \"fairness\" failed before the coalition's story of \"aspiration\" suggests Australia has not called time on neoliberalism in the way that voters elsewhere seem ready to. Certainly there is disillusionment, evidenced by a record vote for minor parties and independents. But ultimately, 27 years of economic growth and only six years of wage stagnation (rather than the decades of it in the United States) mean that while skepticism of the corporate world and trepidation about the economy exists, Australia isn't prepared to experiment with its economic formula just yet. Australians may not be entirely happy with the status quo, but they are clearly still prepared to vote for it.\n\nWaleed Aly, a contributing opinion writer, is a columnist, a broadcaster and a politics lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

British political discourse resembles, at times, a national dream journal. People use their public platforms to suggest futures beyond the political impasse that are -- politically, legally, sometimes even physically -- unattainable, and yet like all fantasy, reveal much about what they really desire.\n\nThe Leavers' backward-facing dreams of imperial renewal are one example. Remainers' legal and procedural challenges to Brexit (and perhaps the very idea the whole thing could be bottled by a second referendum) count as well. But the latest fantasy, emerging in the press and on social media as the politics around Brexit remain as deadlocked as ever and Prime Minister Theresa May founders before a Parliament that will neither pass her deal nor remove her from power, is to call for a competent foreign leader to take over the country. Less \"take back control\" and more \"why can't someone else do it.\"\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand is a popular candidate for the job. \"If the United Kingdom had been led by Ardern we might still have had Brexit, but we would not have ended up with this national humiliation, a divided society and an imperiled economy,\" Tony Blair's former chief of staff wrote in The Guardian in March. This was echoed by a columnist in The Mirror: \"If only Theresa were more like Jacinda maybe we wouldn't be in this mess,\" before declaring, \"If only we could get her.\" Even a columnist in the Scottish Sun, a conservative paper, asked: \"Can we adopt her? Please? Can we have her as Prime Minister, this living, smiling antidote to our own drippy, croaky, indecisive, soulless Theresa?\"\n\nThe desire spills out on social media, too. I hesitate to recommend Twitter as useful for any sort of public sentiment analysis, but right now there are people -- real people with children, best-selling books and magazine columns -- imploring not just Ms. Ardern, or the similarly affable prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, but Donald Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland and current president of the European Commission, to take over Britain.\n\nThe exact method of this potential coup is never discussed, because, of course, the people calling for it don't actually mean it. But they do mean something. This particular fantasy -- a familiar foreign leader in competent managerial mode saving the country -- is something entirely new, and not specific to Brexit. In the immediate aftermath of President Trump's election, I lost count of the number of Americans who, upon learning I was Canadian, would wait a single, sad beat, before asking if they could borrow Mr. Trudeau. The American news media was particularly committed to this dream: recall the cover of Rolling Stone magazine in July 2017 asking \"Why can't he be our president?\"\n\nBrexit and Trump are often said to be signs that politics is broken; they signal deep, unseen faults preceding them, which have only fractured further since. This suggests a breakdown not just of specific administrations in the short term, but a large-scale loss of faith in entire national systems of politics. The real heart of the competent-outsider fantasy is that politics is still O.K. somewhere else, that there is a place it hasn't become splintered, tribal and seemingly beyond control.\n\nBut these leaders don't actually offer solutions to problems like Brexit or Mr. Trump's election. How could they? Neither New Zealand nor Canada has faced these kinds of challenges. Nor does their appeal lie in their fresh-faced, telegenic youth. The fantasy here is about something else, not a path forward out of political crisis, but a return to an idealized past of consensus. Mr. Trudeau and Ms. Ardern are attractive because they still practice a brand of genial, inclusive liberalism, the so-called \"third way\" that ruled Western democratic politics for the better part of the past 25 years, and in doing so, they nod to the familiarity and safety of our own political past.\n\nSo when we laud them, we acclaim the very intangible qualities that seem to have vanished from our own politics and politicians: optimism, openness, pragmatism, a sense of general ease in the world. These objects of fantasy seem as if they were dreamed up by the great theorist of 1990s third way politics, Anthony Giddens. Their immediate antecedents are Mr. Blair and Bill Clinton, politicians who first realized the value of speaking in moral imperatives while presenting the rational cool of a business executive.\n\nIn those years, politicians appeared to have transcended ideology and the need to mediate conflict, and focused instead on delivering incremental gains in prosperity and social justice. They became less like leaders and more like pragmatic managers. \"What matters is what works,\" Mr. Blair frequently claimed.\n\nAcross the Western world, governments became more similar and more stable than at perhaps any other point in our history. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Blair brought in like-minded leaders to promote what Sidney Blumenthal, a confident of Mr. Clinton, called \"an international Third Way.\" Al From, an adviser to the Democratic Party, wrote in 1997 that the third way was \"the worldwide brand name for progressive politics for the Information Age,\" evoking the binding, world-shrinking pulse of the early public internet.\n\nAnd so, like the transnational business class they drew their vocabulary and values from, politicians came to appear strangely interchangeable. When George W. Bush was elected in the United States -- an anomaly, it seemed at the time -- Mr. Blair was jokingly called \"the Prime Minister of the United States,\" and American liberals like the writer Paul Berman lauded him as \"the leader of the free world.\" Mr. Blair, in absentia, was the carrier of this new, irresistible internationalism.\n\nMs. Ardern and Mr. Trudeau fit within that lineage. Ms. Ardern worked as a policy adviser to Mr. Blair and heads a New Zealand Labour Party that is politically similar to its British counterpart in the Blair era. In 2016, Mr. Blair himself singled out Mr. Trudeau as one of a handful of leaders to \"renew the Third Way.\"\n\nBut in the countries where it began, the United States and Britain, this kind of politics is in decline with the electorate. The problems were clear from the beginning: \"They imply that we now live in a society which is no longer structured by social division,\" the political theorist Chantal Mouffe wrote in 1998. And sure enough, politicians promised it was possible to surf the waves of globalization at the exact moment when all the middle and lower classes could do was tread water, and parties of the right formed or reconstituted around cultural fault lines.\n\nRelatedOpinion | Sushil AaronWhy Jacinda Ardern MattersMarch 19, 2019\n\nThese are the divisions that shape our politics now. And there is no substantive reason to think that leaders elsewhere would be better suited to deal with them than the ones we currently have. After all, they come from the same stock. Changing government, Mr. Blair said in 1999, \"is like sweeping away the entire management of a company\" -- but there are few people today who believe that management is what we truly need, and fewer still think that switching out the chief executive for a smarter, better looking one counts as change. The notion rings obviously hollow now, but the main proponents of these fantasies spent most of their lives in a world where it seemed self-evident.\n\nThe great irony is that the political shift that happened in the 1990s was fundamentally opposed to nostalgia. Mr. Giddens wrote at the time of a \"post-traditional society\" and a new politics that freed market economics from sentimental conservative dreams of traditional family and religion, and social justice from romantic leftist notions of solidarity and revolutionary change. Like all things claiming to represent the future in their time, it now evokes nostalgia itself.\n\nStephen Buranyi (@stephenburanyi) is a writer based in London.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

(Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post) By Andrew L. Yarrow May 20 at 7:00 AM\n\nOne evening in late March, about 20 activists gathered at a cafe in Dupont Circle to discuss their campaign strategy for an upcoming election, in which thousands of Washington-area residents are eligible to cast ballots. How can we best get out the vote? What happens if a new party enters the race? How do we counter the far right?\n\nIt was shaping up to be one of the more important elections of recent years. What election might that be, you ask? Not the one that will decide who controls the Virginia legislature. That's in November. And despite the growing horde of presidential candidates, the Iowa caucuses are not until February. No, the people gathered at the cafe weren't Bernie Bros and they weren't wearing MAGA hats. The voters they were seeking to influence weren't even American, but French.\n\nEver since a 2008 reform came into effect, French expats have had an intriguing political relationship to their home country. In elections for the French National Assembly, overseas citizens now vote for candidates to represent them where they live. French residents of the United States and Canada, for instance, have a representative in the 577-member assembly -- as do French voters in 10 other overseas constituencies.\n\nThe day of the meeting in Dupont Circle, a different type of campaign was on the agenda: the election for the European Parliament, set for May 26. French expats do not have specific representatives in the European Parliament; like all French voters, they cast ballots for a party's list, with seats allotted based on how many overall votes the party wins. Still, France's system of representation in the National Assembly gives expats a more relevant stake in their country's politics -- and arguably shapes their involvement in all elections.\n\nEveryone in attendance at the meeting was a partisan of La R\u00e9publique En Marche (LREM), France's governing party. They sat around a long oval table filled with croissants, cafe au lait and policy documents. There were college students and economists, policy wonks and retirees, some wearing jeans or spring dresses, others still spiffy in their work clothes. They spoke in French about politics and strategy, occasionally lapsing into English.\n\nB\u00e9atrice Leydier, a young employee of an international-development NGO, urged the committee to do outreach with families whose children go or went to Rochambeau, the French international school in Bethesda, Md. Laughing, she recalled leafleting before the 2017 presidential and parliamentary elections outside a local French bakery on weekends, where she had gone in hopes of finding French people.\n\nThis year's European elections are important for many reasons, some of the LREM supporters told me. In the wake of Brexit and often virulent anti-European Union sentiment across the continent, the key issue, at least symbolically, is the survival of the 28-nation union. \"Many far-right nationalist parties in Europe tap into long-standing fears about globalization and a dilution of national identity, and are hostile to immigration, Islam and the E.U. itself,\" said Kaltoum Maroufi-Colle, an art teacher at Montgomery College.\n\n\"We want to improve the E.U., but the nationalists have no vision for Europe and don't believe in the E.U.,\" Guillaume Deybach, the chief executive of a local insurance company, said as he sipped a glass of red wine.\n\n\"We're in a bubble here,\" cautioned Jeremy Lagelee, a young lawyer who recently moved back to Paris. \"President Macron is very popular here.\" Lagelee recalled finding almost no supporters of the far-right and far-left candidates when he campaigned for LREM in Washington in 2017.\n\nIndeed. Although Emmanuel Macron has been beset with \"yellow vest\" protesters in recent months, he was a big favorite of the 160,000 French nationals in America, and in Washington especially. He won more than 92 percent of the D.C.-area vote in the second, decisive round of the 2017 election, when his opponent was Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front. By contrast, in France, Macron won 66.1 percent.\n\nAlexandre Kleitman, who co-directs LREM's Washington \"committee\" with Leydier, said they would try to reach the more than 15,000 French voters in the D.C. region mostly through social media and existing networks. (The party has 17 committees working for it in the United States. Other French political parties also have committees, although they are fewer and far less active.) But turning out the vote for European Parliament seats can be tough because that election draws less attention than French parliamentary ones. In 2014, during the last campaign for the European Parliament -- where France currently has 74 of 751 seats -- turnout among French voters in the United States was only about 10 percent. Compare that to the 2017 presidential election, when voter turnout among U.S.-based French nationals was 44 percent, according to France-Am\u00e9rique, a magazine published by the French Embassy.\n\nLaurence Sage, a retired World Bank employee living near Friendship Heights, likes France's post-2008 practice of electing overseas representatives to the National Assembly. \"We need a representative who is conscious of matters that concern those of us with a foot in both continents,\" Sage explained. Nabil Bessaha, a 45-year-old in North Bethesda who has spent most of his working life in D.C., added, \"We want to make sure that France doesn't treat us like second-class citizens.\"\n\n\"French living abroad have different issues from those living in France,\" Roland Lescure, the representative for the United States and Canada in the French National Assembly, told me from Paris. \"They're concerned about things like what benefits can they qualify for, funding for overseas French schools, and moving in and out of the country.\"\n\nLescure, 52, was just another French expat when he was elected in 2017. He now represents one of the world's geographically largest political constituencies, stretching from Puerto Rico to Yukon. A financier in Montreal whose parents had been Communists, he had never been a politician, but like many LREM candidates, he was seduced by Macron's potential to alter the French political landscape. \"French politics needed a change,\" he said. \"The usual suspects had been around too long, and many of us wanted to break the old left-right divide.\"\n\nLescure not only represents his U.S. and Canadian constituents but also chairs a parliamentary economic-affairs committee, focusing on making France more competitive and business-friendly. \"It's a pretty fast pace,\" he said of his job. \"I make about 15 trips a year\" to Washington and elsewhere in North America.\n\nBack in Dupont Circle, Deybach slyly reflected on the benefits of being a Frenchman voting in Washington. Because overseas French are exempt from most French taxes if they spend more than six months of the year outside of France, he said: \"Unlike D.C. residents, who have taxation without representation, we have representation without taxation.\"\n\nAndrew L.

While Pelosi has successfully reined in public disagreement over her strategy, the push and pull of initiating impeachment proceedings is increasingly playing out in public.\n\nOne of Pelosi's chief lieutenants, House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), admitted on the Sunday shows that Trump may be backing the party into a corner.\n\nICMYI: While Trump is seeking to block Deutsche Bank from complying with congressional subpoenas from the House Intelligence and Financial Services committees seeking Trump's personal and business financial records, the New York Times's David Enrich revealed that \"Anti-money laundering specialists at Deutsche Bank recommended in 2016 and 2017 that multiple transactions involving legal entities controlled by Donald J.

But this time is different, coming after five years of crises have swept the continent and during a moment where European identity is as much a domestic issue as it is an international one.\n\nBrexit: Britain was never supposed to participate in these elections. But Prime Minister Theresa May's failure to get her withdrawal plan passed at home has now almost guaranteed the country might be sending members to the same body it voted to leave. If that's not weird enough, the new European Parliament won't be seated until November, meaning that Britain's Members of European Parliament (MEP) may never be seated or serve extremely short terms.\n\nNationalism: The post-Brexit fear was that the E.U. would see a rush to the exits by other nations. Instead, even nationalist parties that despise Brussels have found that its unwise to mount leave campaigns. Figures like Italy's Matteo Salvini and France's Marine Le Pen are instead looking to change the system from the inside.\n\nKey: The elections could determine the fate of several leaders of America's chief allies such as France and Germany.

(Fabian Bimmer/Reuters) By Griff Witte and Griff Witte Europe-focused correspondent with extensive experience in the Middle East and South Asia Luisa Beck Luisa Beck Reporter covering Europe from The Washington Post's Berlin bureau May 19 at 6:00 AM\n\nBREMEN, Germany -- If there was ever a safe haven for Europe's center-left, it was the brawny industrial hub of Bremen.\n\nThick with workers at the region's bountiful factories and pulsating harbor, the city-state voted for the Social Democrats -- Germany's oldest party, famed for its Nazi-era resistance -- for more than 70 years. But perhaps not this one.\n\nIn elections May 26, the party that effortlessly dominated is in danger of losing its grip. It's a once-unthinkable indignity that reflects a broader identity crisis for parties across the West -- including America's Democrats -- that present themselves as champions of workers, unions and social democracy, but have seen support wither in their former heartlands.\n\nFor Germany's Social Democrats, the outlook is especially dire.\n\n\"What we're witnessing is a really big moment,\" said Andreas Klee, director of the politics program at Bremen University. \"It's the burial of a party.\"\n\nThe party itself is not ready to declare its demise. Even as the Social Democrats careen toward a new nadir -- with dismal results expected not only in Bremen but across the country in European parliamentary elections -- party leaders and activists are plotting a revival.\n\nAnd as with Democrats in the United States -- as well as like-minded parties across Europe -- much of the momentum is coming from the left.\n\nJust as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has ignited passions among liberal American voters, the leader of the Social Democrats' youth wing, the Adidas-wearing Kevin K\u00fchnert, is leading an insurgency within his party aimed at a bolder, more radical course.\n\nHe vigorously defends socialism, and recently dominated German political conversations for days with his suggestion that automaker BMW be collectivized. \"Without collectivization,\" he told the German newspaper Die Zeit, \"overcoming capitalism is inconceivable.\"\n\nKevin K\u00fchnert, head of the youth wing of the German Social Democrats (SPD), visits a Berlin apartment building where residents are concerned about affordable housing. (Carsten Koall/Getty Images)\n\nThe comments provoked a furor -- including stinging condemnations, many from within the Social Democrats' own ranks -- but also emboldened supporters who feel the party's coziness with the ruling conservatives has led it to an electoral dead end.\n\nEven without going as far as K\u00fchnert would like, leaders of the Social Democrats (SPD) have signaled they are prepared to turn left. The party recently disavowed welfare cuts implemented during the SPD's last run atop the federal government, an era when the party saw capturing the center as the surest path to power.\n\nMeanwhile, some SPD leaders are mulling whether to break off their long-running role as junior partner in a coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union. That decision would probably come with the choice to draw a more vivid distinction between Germany's two traditionally dominant parties.\n\nThe left has been invigorated elsewhere in Europe as the center-left declines. In Greece, a radical leftist party won two elections and has driven the old center-left party to the brink of extinction. In Britain, the Labour Party is led by Jeremy Corbyn, a figure once relegated to the far-left fringe. And in Spanish elections last month, the center-left Socialists came out on top with an unapologetic defense of progressive policies, including a 22-percent minimum wage hike.\n\n\"Among social democrats across Europe right now, it's mainstream to look left,\" said Joachim Schuster, a member of the European Parliament and longtime Bremen politician. \"We've had years of cooperation with the conservatives, and most of us are not too happy about it. We need to establish our differences.\"\n\nThe overall picture for both the center-left and center-right in Europe is one of decline. In this month's elections for the European Parliament, both factions are on pace for big losses, with each camp likely to shed about 20 percent of its seats as the continent's politics continue to fragment.\n\nBut the struggles of social democratic parties have been more existential. The situation in Bremen shows why.\n\nBritain's opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn attends the launch of his party's European election campaign in Chatham, England, on May 9. (Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nFor decades, elections here were a foregone conclusion, with powerful unions helping to ensure their members made their way from the factory floor to the voting booth to cast ballots for the SPD. But the workers of old are gone -- and so are the party's voters.\n\n\"Twenty years ago, you took a tour of the Airbus factory here and you saw people with tools actually making the planes. Now you walk in and it looks like a dentist's office. People are working on laptops. It's very sterile,\" said Klee, the politics professor. \"The core problem with the SPD is they don't have a voter base anymore.\"\n\nThat reality has brought the party to the brink of an astonishing result: In state elections here May 26, which coincide with the European vote, polls show the SPD may lose to the CDU for the first time in Germany's post-World War II history.\n\nDefeat could have national implications, making it more likely that the SPD would pull out of the coalition with Merkel's party and force new federal elections.\n\nAlthough that is considered unlikely until the end of the year, it's the outcome that K\u00fchnert and his allies are pushing for -- a necessary prerequisite, he argues, for the party's revival after years in which it has governed with Merkel while sinking in the polls.\n\n\"We were always against the grand coalition with the conservatives,\" said Sebastian Schmugler, who leads the SPD's youth wing in Bremen. \"Now we can say, 'We told you so.'\u2009\"\n\nSchmugler, a 24-year-old law student, said the party needs to compromise less and fight for its ideals more or it risks trending toward irrelevance.\n\n\"The young generation can't understand it. We have our positions, but then we make a deal and we lose too much,\" he said. \"So we're just going down, down, down.\"\n\nBut ditching the coalition might not be enough to reverse the party's fortunes.\n\nThe depth of the problem was on display at a recent debate at a Bremen vocational school. At one time, the SPD would have been the clear crowd favorite. But this time, the room appeared divided among a number of mainstream parties.\n\nKevin K\u00fchnert, speaking in Wittenberg, Germany, says his party should abandon its centrist partnership and move left. (Jens Schlueter/Getty Images)\n\nAnd the questions from the students -- hundreds of whom listened intently for 90 minutes as the candidates spelled out positions -- were hardly in the SPD's wheelhouse. None focused on wages, pensions or social welfare. Instead, the students asked about artificial intelligence, immigration and, most of all, climate change.\n\nEspecially on the latter two issues, the SPD has struggled to form clear positions as it has sought to balance competing interests among supporters whose positions don't fit neatly with any ideology. Other parties have not had the same problem -- and have benefited as the SPD has bled.\n\n\"We have leaks in both directions,\" said Bj\u00f6rn Tsch\u00f6pe, leader of the SPD in the state parliament. \"To the Greens because of climate change and on identity issues to the far right.\"\n\nTsch\u00f6pe, a gray-haired party veteran, cautioned that any lurch to the left will come with costs. And he asserted that K\u00fchnert, while asking the right questions, is \"wrong\" to think that collectivization of private companies is the answer.\n\nThe party's rebuilding, he acknowledged, would need to be a long-term process, with even strongholds like Bremen potentially lost along the way.\n\n\"If you govern a place for over 70 years, you are responsible for its good points and its bad,\" he said. \"You can't blame anyone else.\"\n\nRead more\n\nIn what may be Britain's last European election, Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party is expected to dominate\n\nItaly's Salvini leads Europe's ethnonationalist surge\n\nMacron wants to revive Europe, but European elections could kill his plans.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/w4VazJO7wRebWmmQHNmb1KS22XI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KFN4GCTXJMI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4791515", "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 295957440}, {"uri": "1139680237", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2019-05-19", "time": "07:56:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-19T07:56:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/frances-macron-forced-to-curb-his-ambitions-for-europe/2019/05/19/af8676cc-7a08-11e9-a7bf-c8a43b84ee31_story.html", "title": "France's Macron forced to curb his ambitions for Europe", "body": "By Sylvie Corbet and Angela Charlton\u2009|\u2009AP May 19 at 3:41 AM\n\nPARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron sees himself as Europe's savior and next week's European Parliament elections as a make-or-break moment for the beleaguered European Union.\n\nBut Macron is no longer the fresh-faced force who marched into a surprising presidential victory to the rousing EU anthem two years ago. His pro-Europe vision has collided with populists and national interests across the continent. And at home, his political vision has given rise to France's raucous yellow vest uprising over his government's pro-business policies.\n\nMacron wanted the May 23-26 European Parliament elections to be the key moment that he could push his ambitions for a stronger Europe -- but instead, nationalists and populists who criticized the 28-nation bloc could achieve unprecedented success.\n\nThey argue that EU leaders have failed to manage migration into the continent and remain out of touch with ordinary workers' concerns.\n\n\"We have a crisis of the European Union. This is a matter of fact. Everywhere in Europe, when you look at the past five to six years, in our country but in a lot of countries, all the extremes, extreme-rights, are increasing,\" Macron said Thursday, making an unexpected appeal for European unity on the sidelines of a technology trade show.\n\n\"On currency, on digital, on climate action, we need more Europe,\" he said. \"I want the EU to be more protective of our borders regarding migration, terrorism and so on, but I think if you fragment Europe, there is no chance you have a stronger Europe.\"\n\nIn person, the 41-year-old Macron comes across as strikingly, sincerely European. A political centrist, he's at ease quoting Greek playwrights, German thinkers or British economists. France's youngest president grew up with the EU and has been using the shared European euro currency his whole adult life, and sees it as Europe's only chance to stay in the global economic game.\n\nMacron has already visited 20 of the EU's 28 countries in his two years in office, and while he acknowledges the EU's problems, he wants to fix the bloc -- not disassemble it.\n\nMacron won the 2017 presidential election over France's far-right, anti-immigration party leader Marine Le Pen on a pledge to make Europe stronger to face global competition against the Unites States and China. Since then, he's had to make compromises with other EU leaders -- and clashed with some nations where populist parties govern, from Poland to neighboring Italy.\n\nFour months after his election, Macron outlined his vision for Europe in a sweeping speech at Paris' Sorbonne university, calling for a joint EU budget, shared military forces and harmonized taxes.\n\nBut with Brexit looming and nationalism rising, Macron has had to reconsider his ambitions. He called his political tactics with other EU leaders a \"productive confrontation.\"\n\n\"In Europe, what is expected from France is to clearly say what it wants, its goals, its ambitions, and then be able to build a compromise with Germany to move forward\" with other European countries, Macron said last week.\n\nMacron stressed that despite her initial reluctance, German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed last year to create a eurozone budget they hope will boost investment and provide a safety mechanism for the 19 nations using the euro currency.\n\nIn March, Macron sought to draw support for a Europe of \"freedom, protection and progress\" with a written call to voters in 28 countries to reject nationalist parties that \"offer nothing.\"\n\nAnd he proposed to define a roadmap for the EU by the end of this year in a discussion with all member nations and a panel of European citizens.\n\n\"There will be disagreement, but is it better to have a static Europe or a Europe that advances, sometimes at different paces, and that is open to all?\" he asked.\n\nFrance and Germany are the two heavyweights in Europe, and Macron can also count on cooperation from pro-European governments of Belgium, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and others.\n\nHe has made a point, however, of not yet visiting Hungary or Poland, two nations led by populist leaders whom Macron accused last year of \"lying\" to their people about the EU.\n\nFrance has also been entangled in a serious diplomatic crisis with Italy over migration into Europe. Italy's anti-migrant Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has repeatedly criticized Macron and is backing his rival Le Pen's National Rally party in the election this week that aims to fill the European parliament's 751 seats.\n\nMacron has little chance to repeat Europe-wide what he did in France: rip up the political map by building a powerful centrist movement that weakened the traditional left and right.\n\nThe campaign for Macron's Republic on the Move party is being led by former European Affairs Minister Nathalie Loiseau under a banner called \"Renaissance.\" The party wants to associate with the pro-market ALDE alliance to create new centrist group at the European Parliament.\n\nBut across the continent, the centrists are not expected to come out remotely on top but rank third or even lower behind the parliament's traditional two biggest groups, the right-wing European People's Party and the left-wing Socialists and Democrats group.\n\nEven at home, Macron is far from certain of being able to claim victory in the European vote. Polls suggest his party will be among France's top two vote-getters in the election, which takes place in France on May 26.\n\nBut its main rival, the far-right National Rally party, is determined to take revenge on Macron beating Le Pen so decisively in 2017.\n\nMacron's political opponents across the spectrum are calling on French voters to seize the European vote to reject his government's policies.\n\nWhile he won 64% of the presidential vote in 2017, French polls show that Macron's popularity has been around half that for the past year.\n\nIt reached record lows when France's yellow vest movement broke out last fall, demanding relief from high taxes and stagnant wages for French workers, then slightly rose as extensive violence during yellow vest protests, especially in Paris, dampened support for the movement's cause.\n\nStill, the yellow vests are not going away. New protests against Macron and his government are planned for the EU election day.\n\n___\n\nCatherine Gaschka in Paris contributed to the story\n\n___\n\nFor more news from The Associated Press on the European Parliament elections, go to https://www.apnews.com/EuropeanParliament\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Days earlier, Ms. Le Pen was accused of making a white supremacist hand gesture in a selfie with an ultranationalist politician from Estonia. Before that, Mr. Salvini yucked it up with Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, Europe's proud \"illiberal democrat,'' beside a barbed wire border fence erected to block migrants.\n\nThe messaging is anything but subtle: The far-right populists of the European Union are banding together for a frontal assault on the political establishment in this week's elections for the European Parliament. The races are seen as the best barometer of just how angry and alienated Europe really is -- and just how broadly populists of various stripes can break through after years of gaining political strength.\n\n\"For the first time, we'll see meaningful populist representation at the European level,\" said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe for the Eurasia Group, \"so there is at least a risk of a populist insurgency trying to take over or paralyze institutions from within, with implications for Europe's capacity to act.\"\n\nPopulists are not expected to win the biggest number of the Parliament's 751 seats, let alone a majority. The flurry of campaign photo ops may also prove to be misleading: Egos and differing agendas could interfere once it comes time for the various populist parties to create legislative coalitions and act with discipline. Still, analysts predict a major electoral breakthrough that is certain to disrupt European politics.\n\nAnd for now, the vote has set up a stark contrast: Even as the populists are playing to anger and nationalism, mainstream leaders are trying to sell their apathetic voters on maintaining the course. President Emmanuel Macron of France, who embodies the pro-Europe establishment, argues that \"more Europe\" is needed, not less.\n\n\"This election is between the builders and the breakers,\" said Marietje Schaake, a liberal Dutch legislator. \"Will people come out to vote because they know what's at stake?\"\n\nA Stark Political Divide\n\nThe European Union is a colossus, a federation of 28 nations (including Brexit-paralyzed Britain) that constitutes the world's biggest single market and has more than 500 million citizens. But it is still a political work in progress, led by national leaders working as a collective, with a large, rivalrous and unelected executive branch in Brussels. The elections every five years for the European Parliament are considered the truest test of public attitudes toward the bloc.\n\nEuropean politics have been fragmenting since the financial crisis of 2008, and populist anger deepened after an influx of migrants from Africa and the Middle East, reviving some of the Continent's oldest and ugliest impulses. Anti-Semitism is rising. Anti-elite and anti-immigrant sentiments remain acute. Nationalist and identitarian movements are gaining clout, while once marginalized neo-fascist parties have become more vocal.\n\nYet if the populists once vowed to shatter the European Union, they have softened their agenda to match public attitudes. Polls in member states, minus Britain, show that voters, if unhappy with their current circumstances, want to change the bloc rather than destroy it, which is why leaders like Mr. Salvini and Ms. Le Pen talk about altering the European Union from within.\n\nInvoking hot-button issues like migration, terrorism and Islamophobia, far-right and far-left populists place blame on remote bureaucrats in Brussels and call for devolving more power to national governments. They hope the election will both gum up Brussels and give them extra leverage in domestic politics, which is what many of them care most about.\n\nOn the campaign trail, the populists have dominated news media attention. Mr. Salvini, Italy's powerful deputy prime minister, is campaigning so often that critics say he is almost never at work. A bevy of photographers documented his meeting with Mr. Orban along the Serbia-Hungary border, as the two men hoisted themselves up into a watchtower to stare across the empty frontier with binoculars -- the way American officials like to stare at North Korea from Panmunjom.\n\n\"To defend the borders and the safety of our children,\" Mr. Salvini tweeted, as he urged a vote for his party, the populist League.\n\nPopulists Ascendant, but Can They Get Along?\n\nThe question is whether voters are still animated by migration and the clash-of-civilizations rhetoric often used by Mr. Salvini and Mr. Orban. As important is whether the varied populists, assuming they win a sizable number of seats, can coalesce into a powerful coalition. That part is very doubtful.\n\nMr. Salvini recently announced an alliance of populist, far-right, anti-immigration, euroskeptic parties called \"Toward a Europe of Common Sense.\" But if he hopes such a coalition can become the largest bloc in the Parliament, the prospects are dim, partly because of a clash of egos and agendas among different populist parties. At the founding event for his alliance, Mr. Salvini produced only three other parties as partners -- the Danish People's Party, the Alternative for Germany and the Finns party, which just came in second in Finland's national elections, with some 17.5 percent of the vote.\n\nOpinion polls suggest that populist parties could win up to 180 seats in European Parliament, enough to create serious delays and difficulties in the next Parliament, in which the center-right and center-left are expected to lose their traditional majority. Ms. Schaake, the Dutch legislator, said that \"the real story is fragmentation and what will happen in the center.\" The populists will not agree on everything, she said.\n\n\"But they can make a mess.\"\n\nIn addition to passing or rejecting laws, European lawmakers have new powers that could allow populists to block trade deals, approve the bloc's budget and play an important role in determining who will replace the European Union's most powerful leaders: Jean-Claude Juncker, the current president of the European Commission; Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council; and Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank.\n\nEven if they are replaced by others from the pro-European mainstream, countries led by euroskeptics, like Italy, Hungary and Poland, will get to nominate powerful commissioners, which could mean more squabbling at the top and a shift away from federalism.\n\nThe potential for polarization will reach into the Commission, too, said Daniela Schwarzer, director of the German Council on Foreign Relations. \"Who will Orban and Salvini send as commissioners?\" she asked. \"And the scrutiny of candidates by Parliament will be tougher.\" Parliament has the right to scrutinize commissioners and to endorse or reject the whole slate.\n\nVoters, meanwhile, are unpredictable. Turnout is usually low in European races, which gives advantages to motivated, more narrowly focused populist parties. A study of the electorate by the European Council on Foreign Relations found Europe's voters more volatile than polarized. Immigration, the main topic for many populists, ranked only third among European voter concerns, behind Islamic radicalism, much of it homegrown, and the national economy.\n\n\"Swathes of voters,\" said Mark Leonard, the council's director, \"are moving fluidly between parties of the right and left.\"\n\nIndeed, if many voters are attracted to the populists, the study showed that many others are terrified of them, and the growing nationalist sentiment.\n\nA Brexit Mess\n\nOne main reason is the ongoing mess over Brexit. Britain was supposed to be out of the European Union at the end of March, long before these elections. But the shambolic impasse in Westminster has continued, forcing Britons to participate in elections for a European Parliament that three years ago they voted to leave.\n\nBrexit, however, has cut both ways. While it has shown euroskeptics how difficult and costly it is to leave the bloc, British participation in these elections is benefiting the euroskeptics and the populists. The main winner so far is the beer-swilling English nationalist, Nigel Farage, whose new Brexit Party is making huge gains at the expense of both mainstream parties, the Conservatives and Labour.\n\nFor as long as Britain remains inside the European Union -- at least until the latest extension of Halloween it seems -- Mr. Farage's party will swell the ranks and influence of populists in the European Parliament, where Britain has roughly 10 percent of the seats, while Labour members will aid the Socialist bloc.\n\nWith Prime Minister Theresa May on her way out, Britain could then be led by a fervent Brexiter like Boris Johnson, who would only make mainstream Europeans more anxious about the future -- including the next seven-year budget. It may even make a \"no-deal Brexit\" more attractive to Brussels -- even if a majority in the British Parliament does not want one.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_erlanger@nytimes.com", "name": "Steven Erlanger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/world/xxeu-vote1/xxeu-vote1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4797304", "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 295946340}, {"uri": "1139429404", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-18", "time": "19:46:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-18T19:46:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4313725531101227, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/opinion/steve-bannon-matteo-salvini.html", "title": "Opinion | Steve Bannon Is a Fan of Italy's Donald Trump", "body": "MILAN -- Italy is a political laboratory. During the Cold War, the question was whether the United States could keep the Communists from power. Then Italy produced Silvio Berlusconi and scandal-ridden showman politics long before the United States elected Donald Trump. Now, on the eve of European Parliament elections likely to result in a rightist lurch, it has an anti-immigrant, populist government whose strongman, Matteo Salvini, known to his followers as \"the Captain,\" is the Continent's most seductive exponent of the new illiberalism.\n\nSteve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, has been close to Salvini for a while. That's no surprise. Bannon is the foremost theorist and propagator of the global nationalist, anti-establishment backlash. He's Trotsky to the Populist International. He sensed the disease eating at Western democracies -- a globalized elite's abandonment of the working class and the hinterland -- before anyone. He spurred a revolt to make the invisible citizen visible and to save Western manufacturing jobs from what he calls the Chinese \"totalitarian economic hegemon.\"\n\nNow Bannon is crisscrossing Europe ahead of the elections, held Thursday through next Sunday. He's in Berlin one day, Paris the next. As he explained during several recent conversations and a meeting in New York, he believes that \"Europe is six months to a year ahead of the United States on everything.\" As with Brexit's foreshadowing of Trump's election, a victory for the right in Europe \"will energize our base for 2020.\" The notion of Wisconsin galvanized by Brussels may seem far-fetched, but then so did a President Trump.\n\nPolls indicate that Salvini's League party, transformed from a northern secessionist movement into the national face of the xenophobic right, will get over 30 percent of the Italian vote, up from 6.2 percent in 2014. Anti-immigrant and Euroskeptic parties look set to make the greatest gains, taking as many as 35 percent of the seats in Parliament, which influences European Union policy for more than a half-billion people. In France, Marine Le Pen's nationalists are running neck-and-neck with President Emmanuel Macron's pro-Europe party. In Britain, Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party has leapt ahead of the center-right and center-left.\n\nSalvini, whose party formed a government a year ago with the out-with-the-old-order Five Star Movement, is a central figure in this shift. The coalition buried mainstream parties. He is, Bannon told me, \"the most important guy on the stage right now -- he's charismatic, plain-spoken, and he understands the machinery of government. His rallies are as intense as Trump's. Italy is the center of politics -- a country that has embraced nationalism against globalism, shattered the stereotypes, blown past the old paradigm of left and right.\"\n\nFor all the upheaval, I found Italy intact, still tempering transactional modernity with humanity, still finding in beauty consolation for dysfunction. The new right has learned from the past. It does not disappear people. It does not do mass militarization. It's subtler. It scapegoats migrants, instills fear, glorifies an illusory past (what the Polish sociologist Zygmunt Bauman called \"retrotopia\"), exalts machismo, mocks do-gooder liberalism and turns the angry drumbeat of social media into its hypnotic minute-by-minute mass rally.\n\nSalvini, the suave savior, is everywhere other than in his interior minister's office at Rome's Viminale Palace. He's out at rallies or at the local cafe in his trademark blue \"Italia\" sweatshirt. He's at village fairs and conventions. He's posting on Facebook up to 30 times a day to his 3.7 million followers, more than any other European politician. (Macron has 2.6 million followers.) He's burnishing the profile of the tough young pol (he's 46) who keeps migrants out, loosens gun laws, brandishes a sniper rifle and winks at Fascism -- all leavened with Mr.-Nice-Guy images of him sipping espresso or a Barolo.\n\nHis domination of the headlines is relentless. When, during my visit, a woman was gang raped near Viterbo, his call for \"chemical castration\" of the perpetrators led the news cycle for 24 hours. Like Trump, he's a master of saying the unsayable to drown out the rest.\n\n\"I find Salvini repugnant, but he seems to have an incredible grip on society,\" Nathalie Tocci, the director of Italy's Institute of International Relations, told me. No wonder then that the European far-right has chosen Milan for its big pre-election rally, bringing together Salvini, Le Pen, J\u00f6rg Meuthen of the Alternative for Germany party and many other rightist figures.\n\n\"The European elections will be decisive for the future of our continent,\" Macron warned in a manifesto called \"For European Renewal.\" That's probably an exaggeration, but none has ever felt this important, precisely because European integration, the foundation of postwar peace, and liberal democracy itself seem vulnerable. \"Nationalist retrenchment offers nothing,\" Macron declared. The Brexit fiasco is Exhibit A in that argument. Still, Macron's proposal for the creation of a \"European Agency for the Protection of Democracies\" speaks volumes about where we are.\n\nA nationalist tide is still rising. \"We need to mobilize,\" Bannon told me. \"This is not an era of persuasion, it's an era of mobilization. People now move in tribes. Persuasion is highly overrated.\"\n\nBannon gives the impression of a man trying vainly to keep up with the intergalactic speed of his thoughts. Ideas cascade. He offered me a snap dissection of American politics: blue-collar families were suckers: their sons and daughters went off to die in unwon wars; their equity evaporated with the 2008 meltdown, destroyed by \"financial weapons of mass destruction\"; their jobs migrated to China. All that was needed was somebody to adopt a new vernacular, say to heck with all that, and promise to stop \"unlimited illegal immigration\" and restore American greatness. His name was Trump. The rest is history.\n\nIn Europe, Bannon said, the backlash brew included several of these same factors. The \"centralized government of Europe\" and its austerity measures, uncontrolled immigration and the sense of people in the provinces that they were \"disposable\" produced the Salvini phenomenon and its look-alikes across the Continent.\n\n\"In Macron's vision of a United States of Europe, Italy is South Carolina to France's North Carolina,\" Bannon told me. \"But Italy wants to be Italy. It does not want to be South Carolina. The European Union has to be a union of nations.\"\n\nThe fact is Italy is Italy, unmistakably so, with its high unemployment, stagnation, archaic public administration and chasm between the prosperous north (which Salvini's League once wanted to turn into a secessionist state called Padania) and the southern Mezzogiorno. Salvini's coalition has done nothing to solve these problems even as it has demonized immigrants, attacked an independent judiciary and extolled an \"Italians first\" nation.\n\nA federal Europe remains a chimera, even if the euro crisis revealed the need for budgetary integration. Bannon's vision of Brussels bureaucrats devouring national identity for breakfast is largely a straw-man argument, useful for making the European Union the focus of all 21st-century angst.\n\nThe union has delivered peace and stability. It's the great miracle of the second half of the 20th century; no miracle ever marketed itself so badly. It has also suffered from ideological exhaustion, remoteness, division and the failure to agree on an effective shared immigration policy -- opening the way for Salvini's salvos to hit home in a country that is the first stop for many African migrants.\n\nSalvini grew up in Milan in a middle-class family, dropped out of university, joined the League in its early days in the 1990s and was shaped by years working at Radio Padania where he would listen to Italians' gripes. \"What he heard was complaints about immigrants, Europe, the rich,\" Emanuele Fiano, a center-left parliamentarian, told me. \"He's run with that and is now borderline dangerous.\"\n\nThe danger is not exit from the European Union -- the government has come to its senses over that -- or some Fascist reincarnation. It's what Fabrizio Barca, a former minister for territorial cohesion, called the \"Orbanization of the country,\" in a reference to Viktor Orban, the right-wing Hungarian leader. In other words, insidious domination through the evisceration of independent checks and balances, leading Salvini to the kind of stranglehold on power enjoyed by Orban (with a pat on the back from Trump) or by Vladimir Putin. \"The European Union has been ineffective against Orban,\" Barca noted. Worse, it has been feckless.\n\nAnother threat, as in Trump's United States, is of moral collapse. \"I am not a Fascist but. ...\" is a phrase increasingly heard in Italy, with some positive judgment on Mussolini to round off the sentence. Salvini, in the judgment of Claudio Gatti, whose book \"The Demons of Salvini\" was just published in Italian, is \"post-Fascist\" -- he refines many of its methods for a 21st-century audience.\n\nBarca told me the abandonment of rural areas -- the closing of small hospitals, marginal train lines, high schools -- lay behind Salvini's rise. Almost 65 percent of Italian land and perhaps 25 percent of its population have been affected by these cuts. \"Rural areas and the peripheries, the places where people feel like nobody, are home to the League and Five Star,\" he said. To the people there, Salvini declares: I will defend you. He does not offer a dream. He offers protection -- mainly against the concocted threat of migrants, whose numbers were in fact plummeting before he took office because of an agreement reached with Libya.\n\nThe great task before the parties of the center-left and center-right that will most likely be battered in this election is to reconnect. They must restore a sense of recognition to the forgotten of globalization. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the socialist Spanish prime minister, just won an important electoral victory after pushing through a 22 percent rise in the minimum wage, the largest in Spain in 40 years. There's a lesson there. The nationalist backlash is powerful, but pro-European liberal sentiment is still stronger. If European elections feel more important, it's also because European identity is growing.\n\nAs for the curiously prescient Italian political laboratory, Bannon is investing in it. He's established an \"Academy for the Judeo-Christian West\" in a 13th-century monastery outside Rome. Its courses, he told me, will include \"history, aesthetics and just plain instruction in how to get stuff done, including facing up to pressure, mock TV interviews with someone from CNN or The Guardian ripping your face off.\"\n\nBannon described himself as an admirer of George Soros -- \"his methods, not his ideology\" -- and the way Soros had built up \"cadres\" throughout Europe. The monastery is the nationalist response to Soros's liberalism. There's a war of ideas going on in Italy and the United States. To shun the fight is to lose it. I am firmly in the liberal camp, but to win it helps to know and strive to understand one's adversary.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Many were sentenced to prison or restricted to halfway houses for 10 years and sometimes more.\n\nBut on Monday, a co-founder of Al Muhajiroun, Anjem Choudary, was photographed near his East London home wearing a long white robe and a black electronic ankle tag. Government officials confirmed that Mr. Choudary, one of the country's most notorious radical Islamist preachers, had been released from a probation hotel after serving more than half of a lengthy prison term for inciting support of the Islamic State.\n\nHe remains under close monitoring, but he has begun the gradual process of becoming a free man. And he is not the only one.\n\nHaving served their time, many members of Mr. Choudary's old network are being released from detention. Far from chastened, they have begun to remobilize, vowing to take on far-right extremists and renew their decades-long campaign to eliminate democracy in Britain and establish a caliphate ruled by Shariah law, according to interviews with a handful of former members.\n\nFounded in 1996, Al Muhajiroun, which has used various names over the years, has spent years effectively taunting the British security forces through its ability to continue operating despite being banned in 2006 for its links to terrorism. After a period of dormancy, the group is now remobilizing by continuing to change its name, adopting lower-profile tactics, using encrypted apps and meeting in secret locations.\n\nAccording to former members, areas where the network is regrouping include East London; Luton, a town north of the British capital; and the surrounding county of Bedfordshire.\n\n\"Muslims are being attacked all over the world,\" said Laith, a former member of Al Muhajiroun who would only give his middle name for fear of prosecution. \"Our mission is much more urgent now, and with Anjem and the other brothers out of jail, it's time to regroup and come out harder than before.\"\n\nFor the British authorities, the possibility of the group's re-emergence is a deep concern. Last week, Andrew Parker, the director general of MI5, Britain's domestic counterintelligence and security agency, issued a rare public warning about the continued risks of extremist networks and emphasized the threat posed by groups sympathetic to the Islamic State.\n\n\"In the U.K., there remain individuals who are inspired\" by Islamic State propaganda, he wrote in the newspaper The Evening Standard, \"despite having shown no interest in traveling to Syria.\"\n\nThe security services have expressed particular alarm at the prospect of a newly energized Al Muhajiroun network trying to recruit members as some ISIS fighters and sympathizers attempt to return to Britain after the fall of the Islamic State's so-called caliphate in Iraq and Syria. Britain has taken a tough line against potential returnees, canceling the passports of more than 150 people.\n\nDavid Videcette, a British former counterterrorism detective, said British citizens who had joined the Islamic State would pose a clear risk if they got back home.\n\n\"Suddenly, we are going to have trained fighters who perhaps have the motivation to carry out martyrdom attacks, exposed to a historical network of radicals,\" he said.\n\nFor now, Mr. Choudary is prohibited from speaking in public or from connecting with his old network. But several former members said that his release from prison, along with that of other figures, had emboldened the group, which was linked to 25 percent of all Islamist terrorism-related convictions in Britain between 1998 and 2015.\n\n\"Some activists have started to meet again and are testing the waters as they re-engage with their activism,\" said Michael Kenney, an associate professor of international affairs at the University of Pittsburgh, who spent years embedded with the group as part of the research for his book, \"The Islamic State in Britain.\"\n\nIt is hard to overstate the role Mr. Choudary has played in motivating Islamic extremists. Just last week, for instance, the BBC reported that one of the attackers behind the Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka, Abdul Lathief Jameel Mohamed, was radicalized by Mr. Choudary after attending his sermons during a one-year study abroad program in 2006.\n\n\"No other British citizen has had so much influence over so many terrorists as Choudary,\" said Nick Lowles, the chief executive of a British anti-racist watchdog group, Hope Not Hate, which he says has identified 120 Islamist militants with links to the imam.\n\nA representative of the British Home Office, which has responsibility for monitoring extremist groups, said that the government was aware of the potential threat posed by Mr. Choudary and Al Muhajiroun, and had rigorous procedures in place to handle it.\n\n\"When any terrorist offender is released from prison, we know about it and have robust covert and overt powers to investigate and manage any threat they may pose,\" the government representative said. \"Those released on license remain subject to close monitoring and strict conditions, which if breached can see them go back to prison.\"\n\nMost of those who were senior members of Al Muhajiroun said that they remained under strict surveillance, with their electronic communications monitored, which was confirmed by the Home Office. As a result, they say they carry out their activities discreetly, and avoid any mention of or association with the group's former name.\n\nThe activists say they have shifted their recruitment tactics from provocative public preaching and demonstrations to secret internet forums and smaller group meetings in inconspicuous locations. If the group uses a name that has not been identified as that of a terrorist outfit, then the gatherings are legal.\n\nMost members of the group abide by what they call a \"covenant of security\" that prohibits attacks on non-Muslims in their country of residence. But it is a matter of individual choice.\n\nIn recent years, group members have become increasingly influenced by foreign radical groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, inspiring them to carry out the attacks on and near London Bridge in 2017 and the murder of a British soldier, Lee Rigby, in the capital in 2013.\n\nFor many years, Mr. Choudary, a former lawyer whose preaching emphasized a jihadist ideology in which the West was accused of victimizing Muslims, managed to stay out of prison even as the authorities shut down many members of his broader network.\n\n\"Decrease and destruct, that was their tactic, and I have to admit it worked,\" said Mohammed Shamsuddin, who was recruited to Al Muhajiroun by Mr. Choudary more than 20 years ago.\n\nSipping on a latte at a juice bar in a town in northwestern England, Mr. Shamsuddin said that the authorities could no longer crack down in the same way.\n\n\"Now, all the guys you arrested 10 years ago are being released into the open,\" he said, \"and they are healthier and stronger than before, and it's come at a time when the police are stretched and Brexit is destroying the country.\"\n\nMany of the senior activists of the network who are now regrouping were monitored under the government's Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act of 2011. That legislation provides the framework for a program that restricts the movements of individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activities, through the use of electronic tags and overnight house arrest.\n\nSome, however, said that being placed under the program's restrictions had been more like a long vacation.\n\n\"It was amazing,\" said a man who was subjected to the restrictions, flashing a picture of a brick property with a garden. \"I was placed in a four-bedroom house by myself in the nicest part of Ipswich,\" a town in eastern England.\n\n\"If anything, I got a good rest after years of hard work, got my energy back,\" he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not legally allowed to talk about the program. \"They spent all that money to achieve what in the end? I'm back on Twitter, back on Facebook, back with my brothers. I'm back in society, doing my thing.\"\n\nSome activists in the network denied that Mr. Choudary had encouraged acts of terrorism, claiming that he had directed their energy into an ideological struggle, not a violent one.\n\n\"The British government made a big mistake by putting Anjem in jail,\" said Abdulla Muhid, a 42-year-old former member of Al Muhajiroun. \"He believes in the covenant of security and was able to control the youth as they were getting their education from a learned person. Now, everyone is freelancing, getting radicalized through the internet.\"\n\nIt is not clear how many activists belong to the network formerly known as Al Muhajiroun. Even during the group's peak years in the late 1990s to early 2000s, it never had more than 200 dedicated members, according to Mr. Kenney of the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nIt is also unclear whether Mr. Choudary will reassert his leadership when his license conditions end in 2021. There have been group members who have challenged his leadership in the past, and some of those who are still active in the network suggested that he had been replaced. Still, many said that they were eagerly awaiting his return.\n\n\"People are waiting for Anjem to come out; they are waiting for that spark,\" the activist who recently emerged from the restriction program said.\n\n\"These monitoring programs will do one of two things to you,\" he added. \"Either they will break you or make you hard-core. For me, I'm now rested and feeling more hard-core. I'm ready.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ceylan_yeginsu@nytimes.com", "name": "Ceylan Yeginsu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/world/19choudary/xxchoudary1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 295861800}, {"uri": "1138692594", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-17", "time": "16:55:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-17T16:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/books/review/upheaval-jared-diamond.html", "title": "What to Do When You're a Country in Crisis", "body": "UPHEAVAL Turning Points for Nations in Crisis\n\nBy Jared Diamond\n\nIf you've ever been at a wedding or conference or on board a United connection from O'Hare, and been cornered by a man with Theories About It All, and you came away thinking, \"That was a great experience,\" have I got the book for you.\n\nJared Diamond's \"Upheaval\" belongs to the genre of 30,000-foot books, which sell an explanation of everything. I travel often and see them a lot: at airport bookstores, where Steven Pinker and Yuval Noah Harari (both of whom blurbed \"Upheaval\") and Diamond, of course, deserve permanent shelves; and in the air, where I've noticed that a pretty disproportionate fraction of readers who read in the quiet of 30,000 feet have a preference for writers who write from the viewpoint of 30,000 feet.\n\nSo I dug into Diamond's latest, intrigued by his thesis that the way individual humans cope with crisis might teach something to countries. Then, before long, the first mistake caught my eye; soon, the 10th. Then graver ones. Errors, along with generalizations, blind spots and oversights, that called into question the choice to publish. I began to wonder why we give some people, and only some, the platform, and burden, to theorize about everything.\n\nThe theory proposed by Diamond -- a professor of geography at the University of California at Los Angeles and the author of several books, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Guns, Germs and Steel\" -- is interesting. Human beings go through personal crises all the time. We know a lot about how people change in order to cope -- or fail to. What if we applied those lessons to countries in quagmires?\n\n[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of May. See the full list. ]\n\nDrawing on the work of therapists, Diamond reports that the key for individuals coping with a crisis is \"selective change.\" People who successfully overcome a problem tend to identify and isolate it, figuring out \"which parts of their identities are already functioning well and don't need changing, and which parts are no longer working and do need changing.\" Diamond asks, Could the same be true for countries? He believes so, and he seeks to test his theory by adapting a dozen factors known to affect the resolution of personal crises to national crises. Some factors translate easily -- just as people must first accept being in crisis, nations must first come to a consensus about their woes. Other analogies feel more strained -- help from your close friends translates into material and financial aid from allies. Armed with this framework, Diamond sets out to see how well it fits countries' actual histories.\n\nDiamond's method is the case study. Looking at Finland, Japan, Chile, Indonesia, Germany, Australia and the United States at pivotal moments in their histories, he evaluates their courses of action with reference to his 12 bullet points. Meiji-era Japan, needing to open up to the world while preserving its cultural core, found a way \"to adopt many Western features, but to modify them to suit Japanese circumstances.\" After World War II, Germany worked its way to taking full responsibility for its actions and thereby successfully transformed itself. America, in part because it shrugs off the lessons of other places, struggles to resolve its issues.\n\nAt the end of each chapter, each mini-history, Diamond pauses to ask some variant of: \"How does Indonesia's crisis fit into our framework?\" And this is a tell. The Framework is driving the inquiry here, and everything stands at its service. The people we encounter are seldom richly portrayed, because only The Framework matters. The stories we learn about each country are often partial and slanted, because only The Framework matters. Countries where racism and tolerance, sexism and equality have long been in tension are portrayed as being entirely one thing before magically becoming the opposite thing, because The Framework can only process monoliths.\n\nWith a focus on The Framework, facts recede in importance. The book is riddled with errors. Diamond gets wrong the year of the Brexit vote. He claims that, under President Ronald Reagan, \"government shutdowns were nonexistent.\" But they occurred a number of times. He describes Australian-rules football as a sport \"invented in Australia and played nowhere else.\" But it is played elsewhere -- in Nauru, where it is the national sport, as well as in China, Canada, France, Japan, Ireland and the United States, according to the Australian Football League.\n\nDiamond says a 1976 terrorist attack in Washington, D.C., targeting a former Chilean official, was \"the only known case of a foreign terrorist killing an American citizen on American soil -- until the World Trade Towers attack of 2001.\" This claim wholly overlooks the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, in which six people died. He refers to Lee Kuan Yew as \"Singapore's prime minister,\" even though he no longer occupies that role, not least because he's dead.\n\nThen the generalizations: hoo boy. At one point during World War II, Diamond says, the people of Finland, facing Soviet bellicosity, \"were unanimous in refusing to compromise further.\" A whole nation, unanimous! We learn of another instance of 100 percent society-wide agreement down under, where \"Australians debating the federal constitution argued about many matters but were unanimous about excluding all nonwhite races from Australia.\" But in fact they argued about this issue, too, and one framer, Andrew Inglis Clark, the Tasmanian attorney general, sought, unsuccessfully, to introduce an adapted version of the American 14th Amendment, which would have prohibited discrimination by race.\n\nIn claiming that Germany has become more socially liberal, Diamond claims, \"There is no spanking of children; in fact, it's now forbidden by law!\" But how can a serious thinker confuse the passage of a law with fidelity to it? An organization that tracks the efficacy of the law has found its enactment to have reduced, but hardly ended hitting. To read Diamond is also to learn, apparently, how all Chileans identify (with Europe and the United States, not Latin America); and how all \"Indonesians take their national identity for granted.\" (Except, perhaps, the separatist groups?)\n\nSometimes the book feels written from a drying well of lifelong research rather than from the latest facts. For example, Diamond tells us Americans have always been a highly mobile people and are \"unlikely\" to \"move less often.\" He must be unfamiliar with the rather well-publicized new data declaring the opposite: \"Fewer Americans Are Moving to Pursue Better Jobs Across the Nation,\" NPR says, citing the Census Bureau's research that the number of Americans who move in a given year has dropped by half since the 1940s.\n\nThere are far more of these errors than I have space to list, too many to dismiss this calling-out as nit-picking. And they matter because of the book's nature. If we can't trust you on the little and medium things, how can we trust you where authors of 30,000-foot books really need our trust -- on the big, hard-to-check claims? On how the end of the White Australia policy \"resulted from five considerations.\" (Not four, not six, and the ones you happen to name.) On how Finns' love of their language is what made them willing to fight and die for Finland. On how Tokyo is clean \"because Japanese children learn to be clean and to clean up\" (and not, for example, because the city spends 3.9 percent of its budget on public health and sanitation, according to a quick search, compared with the 1.9 percent of New York City's 2018 budget that went to the Department of Sanitation).\n\nWhile \"Upheaval\" does list sources in the back, Diamond seldom quotes books. He is far fonder of quoting his many friends. \"Why does Japan pursue these stances? My Japanese friends suggest three explanations.\" That's what we're going with? Or he describes \"the 1973 coup that many of my Chilean friends characterize as inevitable.\" First of all, why are we paying you to hear your friends' random theories? Second of all, how can a coup ever be inevitable? You mean to say that a plot as delicate as that could under no scenario have gone wrong?\n\nSince we're talking about our friends, I know so many younger writers, especially women and people of color, who are smart, thoughtful, buttoned up and pretty damn accurate who would kill for an opening to publish a book with a serious publisher -- and who know in their bones that, if they were ever this sloppy, their career would be over before it had even begun.\n\nThere is also a systemic issue here. The time has come for those of us who work in book-length nonfiction to insist that professional fact-checking become as inalienable from publishing as publicity, marketing and jacket design -- and at the publisher's expense rather than as a cost passed on to the author, who, understandably, will often choose to spend her money on health care. In the age of tweets, it cannot be the fate of the book to become ever more tweetlike -- maybe factual, maybe whatever. The book must stand apart, must stand above.\n\nA remaining problem with \"Upheaval\" is one that cannot be fact-checked away, but, happily, is already being fixed across the world of letters. Until recently, in much of American life, and American writing, the default setting of human being was white and/or male. Today so much writing shatters this default, complicates the point of view. And \"Upheaval\" reminds us why that matters.\n\nWhen Diamond describes \"highly egalitarian social values\" as an ethos that has \"remained unchanged\" in Australia, despite having written a chapter about the country's history of legalized racism, he is using a definition of egalitarian that applies only to white people. When he says, \"Social status in Japan depends more on education than on heredity and family connection,\" he is ignoring what it means to be born a woman. \"Of course, my list of U.S. problems isn't exhaustive,\" he admits. \"Problems that I don't discuss include race relations and the role of women.\" You know, the problems affecting the vast majority of Americans.\n\nI almost felt bad for Diamond when, toward the end, he described \"an evening with two women friends, one of them a psychologically na\u00efve optimist in her 20s, the other a perceptive person in her 70s.\" What made the young woman \"psychologically na\u00efve\" to him was that she dated someone who it took her time to see was terrible. (If that's a crime, jail us all.) I felt a strange sympathy for Diamond, who is in his early 80s, because clearly he didn't realize how tone-deaf it is, in 2019, for an established male author to go around labeling a young woman making pretty normal life mistakes as \"psychologically na\u00efve.\" But Diamond is proud to be from another time. He tells us his manuscripts are typed by someone else, he relies on his wife and secretary to use a computer, and he clings to the belief that video games are \"solitary,\" even if massively multiplayer online games are where a growing number of Americans go to be social. He also thinks phones are ruining America because people check them every four minutes. But I have to say, I was doing just that while reading his book, and I was doing it because so many things I read didn't sound accurate, and I, for one, think it's an improvement when 30,000-foot authority can be challenged by Googling from bed.\n\nOn a beach some time ago, I read Jill Lepore's new history of the United States, \"These Truths.\" It is no less ambitious than \"Upheaval.\" But it is a new kind of big book for a new age. We know so much more now. We know the stories that haven't been told, the points of view that have been neglected. Lepore manages to tell many stories, ever shifting her own perspective. She has no pat Framework, no bullet-point theory to test. She tells earthy stories about people famous and obscure, and she is confident enough to let the ideas emerge.

(Toby Melville/Reuters)\n\nFor the last six weeks, May and Corbyn have engaged in cross-party talks in hopes of finding a compromise that could break the Brexit deadlock and win a vote in Parliament.\n\nMany saw it as doomed from the start -- and a cynical play for time by both sides.\n\nOn Friday, Corbyn pulled the plug.\n\nLabour said that they were uncomfortable striking a deal with a Conservative leader who could be gone within weeks.\n\n\"The increasing weakness and instability of your government means there cannot be confidence in securing whatever might be agreed between us,\" Corbyn wrote.\n\nMay's position as prime minister is as precarious as it's ever been. Her Conservative Party received a drubbing in local elections earlier this month and is expected to do poorly in next week's European Parliament elections, with the opinion polls suggesting the Tories will get trounced by Nigel Farage's upstart Brexit Party.\n\n[In what may be Britain's last European election, Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party is expected to dominate]\n\nMay has agreed to discuss a timetable for her departure after Parliament votes on Brexit legislation in the first week of June.\n\nIf she defies the odds and wins that vote, it would be the political comeback of the century. If she loses, then plans could be made for her orderly departure.\n\nBut just because the starting gun hasn't been fired on the leadership race to succeed May doesn't mean that it's not already happening, at least unofficially.\n\nOn Thursday, Boris Johnson, Britain's ambitious former foreign secretary and a leading Brexiteer, said what everybody in Westminster knew already: He was going for it.\n\nA Tory leadership contest for a new prime minister could last several months. From a possible field of a dozen candidates, Conservative lawmakers will narrow the race to two, and then the 125,000 Tory members will get their pick. The vote does not go to the general public.\n\nIn his letter to the prime minister, Corbyn said their Brexit talks had \"gone as far as they can\" and that the race to find her successor had undermined the process.\n\nHe added that \"while there are some areas where compromise has been possible, we have been unable to bridge important policy gaps between us.\"\n\nCorbyn's Labour sought the softest sort of Brexit, one that would have kept Britain so closely aligned with E.U. customs rules and tariffs that it probably would have forbade it from seeing its own independent trade deals with countries like the United States, China and India. That was a red line for May -- and a Brexit that hard-liners would never approve.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in Bristol, May blamed the failure of the talks on Labour's position on Brexit, which many find ambiguous.\n\nAlthough the two sides did find some common ground, May said, \"We haven't been able to overcome the fact that there isn't a common position in Labour about whether they want to deliver Brexit, or hold a second referendum, which could reverse it.\"\n\nIt was long expected that talks between May and Corbyn would be likely to end in tears.\n\nStriking a deal risked tearing apart both the Conservatives and Labour Party, both of which have factions that would be deeply uncomfortable with a compromise.\n\nOn Labour's side, there were critics who were uneasy about being seen to help deliver Brexit, and on the Conservative side, there were those who disliked Labour's key demand for a customs arrangement with the European bloc.\n\nAsked if he could do business with someone like Boris Johnson as prime minister, Corbyn told the BBC: \"Whoever the Tory Party decide is going to be the leader we will put our case and we will challenge them.\"\n\nBritish voters with Brexit on their minds punish main parties in local elections\n\nBrexit: Parliament rejects soft Brexit, second referendum", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OnUjmVWb-tq2QLJP-NHqbIDH8r8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OXVDEATYVUI6TPJFZGEVKXTXMY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4792797", "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 295801260}, {"uri": "1138600790", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-17", "time": "14:48:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-17T14:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/world/europe/jeremy-corbyn-theresa-may.html", "title": "Jeremy Corbyn Halts Brexit Talks With Theresa May", "body": "LONDON -- Bipartisan talks on extricating Britain from the European Union collapsed on Friday, when the opposition Labour Party pulled out, ending the latest attempt to salvage the beleaguered Brexit process and leaving it in a familiar state of deadlock.\n\nIn a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, wrote that the negotiations \"have now gone as far as they can.\"\n\nFor weeks, discussions between ministers in the Conservative government and senior Labour figures had failed to break the Brexit impasse, which has wrecked the leadership of Prime Minister Theresa May and provoked a sharp backlash against both major parties from disenchanted voters, who vented their anger in recent local elections.\n\nMrs. May has been unable to unite her party behind the Brexit agreement she negotiated with the European Union, leading her to turn to Labour for support. But that has produced nothing except increasingly urgent calls from fellow Conservatives for her to step down.\n\nOn Thursday, she announced that she would set out a timetable for her departure next month, and Conservatives whose Brexit views are even further from Labour's are vying to succeed her.\n\nWhile the talks have been conducted in good faith, \"we have been unable to bridge important policy gaps between us,\" Mr. Corbyn wrote in his letter. \"Even more crucially, the increasing weakness and instability of your government means there cannot be confidence in securing whatever might be agreed between us.\"\n\nThe breakdown came as little surprise, since both parties are badly split on Brexit, and neither leader has much room to maneuver. Many Conservative lawmakers were angry about the talks with Labour, and many Labour lawmakers had voiced discontent at taking part in negotiations designed to help salvage Mrs. May's tenure by getting Brexit over the line.\n\nMrs. May blamed the opposition's divisions for the failure of the talks. The problem, she said at a campaign stop in Bristol, was that Labour could not decide \"whether they want to deliver Brexit or hold a second referendum.\"\n\nThe collapse is yet another setback to a prime minister who had already suffered a remarkable string of defeats and has been hounded by members of her own party to leave. Parliament has voted three times to reject her Brexit plan, which would keep Britain closely tied to the European Union at least until the end of 2020 but then extract it from the bloc's main economic structures. She said earlier this week that she would attempt a fourth vote on her plan early next month.\n\nMrs. May had hoped to lure Labour with the prospect that Britain could stay -- at least temporarily -- in a type of customs union with the bloc, thereby eliminating the need for tariffs and many border checks on goods flowing between Britain and continental Europe.\n\nBut that did not prove enough to tempt Labour, which is in favor or retaining closer ties to the European Union to protect the economy. It had argued that Mrs. May had not offered enough concessions and that, in any case, her successor might be a hard-line Brexit supporter who would tear up any agreement.\n\nNext week Britons will vote in elections to the European Parliament on May 23, almost three years after they voted in a referendum to quit the bloc.\n\nMrs. May now has to gird herself for the European elections next week hat could prove disastrous for both the Conservatives and Labour. One recent poll has them trailing both the Brexit Party, led by the hard-line Brexiteer Nigel Farage, and the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe government is expected to try to seek a consensus in Parliament on the way ahead by holding votes on different options, but previous efforts to do so have failed.\n\nMrs. May wants the Labour Party to agree to abide by the outcome of such votes, but there is little incentive for the opposition to sign up to an outcome that it cannot control. And, without the support of Labour, that process looks doomed to leave Brexit at an impasse.\n\nHowever, pressure on Mrs. May and Mr. Corbyn to reach a deal increased earlier this month, following local elections that were bad for both parties. While the Conservatives lost 1,300 seats in local municipalities, Labour failed to take advantage, shedding around 80 itself.\n\nThough Mr. Corbyn, a lifelong Euroskeptic, argued that a deal needed to be reached, his party's divisions have made that outcome difficult. A very large faction in the Labour Party opposes Brexit and wants a second referendum on any deal, so any agreement with the Conservatives would have risked straining loyalty to a breaking point.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_castle@nytimes.com", "name": "Stephen Castle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/world/17brexit/17brexit-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4792797", "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 295800480}, {"uri": "1138281342", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2019-05-17", "time": "07:43:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-17T07:43:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/eu-citizens-in-uk-have-their-say-on-brexit-in-european-vote/2019/05/17/7936bc10-7870-11e9-a7bf-c8a43b84ee31_story.html", "title": "EU citizens in UK have their say on Brexit in European vote", "body": "By Jill Lawless\u2009|\u2009AP May 17 at 2:55 AM\n\nLONDON -- Hedwig Hegtermans has lived in Britain for two decades, but she didn't have a vote when the country decided in 2016 to leave the European Union. She's determined to have her say on Brexit now.\n\nAn election for the European Parliament being held this month in all 28 EU member states -- including the not-yet-departed U.K. -- is giving Hegtermans and other Europeans in Britain the chance to pass judgment on the Brexit decision that left their lives in limbo.\n\n\"It is a way for people to voice their frustration,\" said Hegtermans, a Dutch citizen and member of The 3 Million, a lobby group for EU citizens in Britain.\n\nLike other non-U.K. EU nationals, she was not eligible to vote in Britain's EU membership referendum three years ago -- and like them she saw her automatic right to live and work in Britain whipped away by the Brexit decision. (The British government says all 3 million EU citizens in Britain can stay, but they have to apply for \"settled status\" through a somewhat glitch-prone new registration process).\n\n\"We did not have a vote in the referendum, we could not voice anything while we were the people who will be affected the most,\" Hegtermans said.\n\nShe said the May 23 election to fill the U.K.'s 73 seats in the 751-seat EU legislature \"is one way for us to let our voices (be) heard.\"\n\nThe result of next week's election won't directly affect Brexit. But it will be interpreted as a test of public sentiment -- almost a mini-referendum -- and could sway politicians to take a harder or softer course as Britain heads for the exit door.\n\nThat makes this the most high-profile European election in Britain in years -- but it shouldn't be happening. The U.K. was due to have left the EU by now.\n\nInstead, British politicians are deadlocked over departure terms and Brexit has been postponed from March 29 until Oct. 31 while they try to sort out the mess. So Britain is taking part, and the contest here is dominated by candidates promising either to speed up Brexit or throw it into reverse gear.\n\nPro-European parties are eager to attract votes from EU citizens, who can vote in European polls though not in U.K. national elections.\n\nThat's why a former finance minister of Poland could be found recently standing outside a suburban London subway station, thrusting anti-Brexit leaflets at tired commuters. Jan Vincent-Rostowski, a London-born economist who served in a center-right Polish government between 2007 and 2013, is a candidate for the newly former pro-EU party Change UK.\n\n\"I thought that was something I could bring to the campaign, being both a British citizen -- a Londoner born and bred -- but also a Polish citizen who has done his bit in politics elsewhere,\" Vincent-Rostowski said.\n\n\"Brexit is collapsing under the weight of its own internal contradictions. And if something bad is collapsing I think it's a good idea to give it a push. That's what I'm trying to do.\"\n\nChipper and polite -- \"Can I give you a leaflet madam?\" -- he got a reasonably warm reception in suburban Ealing, a diverse London district that voted 60% for remaining in the European Union. Several Poles recognized him, stopping to chat or film him on their phones.\n\nBut this is a heated and bad-tempered election. Both of Britain's main parties -- the governing Conservative and opposition Labour -- are bracing for a hammering as voters frustrated by the Brexit impasse turn to parties promising either a definitive break with the EU or a chance to remain in the bloc.\n\nThousands of Brexiteers across the country are flocking to rallies for the new Brexit Party led by former U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, who accuses the government of betraying Brexit and wants Britain to walk away from the bloc even if there is no divorce deal to smooth the way.\n\nAmong pro-Europeans, Change UK is competing for votes with the centrist Liberal Democrats and environmentalist Greens. All support holding a new referendum that would include the option of remaining in the EU.\n\nPolitics professor Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London said EU citizens' votes could deliver a boost to pro-EU parties, if \"they can be bothered to come out and vote in what is such a depressing time for them. \"\n\nEU elections in Britain generally have a low turnout. At the last EU election in 2014, it was 35%, and Bale said a turnout of 40% this time would be \"stunning.\"\n\nEU citizens also must navigate a U.K. voter-registration process that requires them to fill out a form declaring that they do not plan to also vote in their home country.\n\nHegtermans said there has been \"quite a bit of confusion\" about the forms, and the deadline for registration passed on May 7. It's likely some Europeans will show up at polling stations only to be turned away.\n\nOthers may stay away out of a common U.K. malaise: Brexhaustion.\n\nEuropeans in London expressed a mix of enthusiasm and resignation at the prospect of an election that -- three years after the vote to leave the EU -- is dominated by Brexit.\n\n\"As a Polish citizen, I would love Britain to stay in the European Union,\" said 32-year-old Kate Staron. \"So definitely I will vote and try to make some difference. .. I encourage everyone else to go and vote as every vote is important.\"\n\nMarcel Wojtyniak, a 25-year-old data analyst also from Poland, wasn't so sure.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of exhaustion on the subject,\" he said.\n\n\"I suppose I just moved on. I accepted the fact. I don't really think the European elections are going to make that much difference.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Jill Lawless at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless\n\n___\n\nFor more news from The Associated Press on the European Parliament elections go to https://www.apnews.com/EuropeanParliament\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Northern Ireland's is even stricter.", "body": "By Karla Adam Karla Adam London correspondent covering the United Kingdom May 16 at 3:01 PM\n\nLONDON -- The passage of Alabama's strictest-in-the-nation abortion bill has renewed calls to overhaul Northern Ireland's abortion regulations, which are among the most restrictive in the developed world.\n\nUnder the Alabama abortion legislation, signed by Republican Gov. Kay Ivey on Wednesday, doctors who perform abortions could face up to 99 years or life in prison, but a pregnant woman would not face penalties.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, both women who have abortions and those who assist them can face up to life in prison.\n\n\"The law in Northern Ireland is considerably more restrictive than Alabama,\" said Fiona de Londras, a law professor at the University of Birmingham.\n\n\"This is not an instance where criminalization is just on the books. There have been charges,\" she added.\n\nIn one high-profile case currently in the courts, prosecutors in Northern Ireland brought charges against a mother who bought abortion pills online for her then 15-year-old daughter, who was in a physically and mentally abusive relationship. After the pregnancy was terminated, the mother shared the information with her doctor, who in turn referred her to the police. The mother has challenged the decision to prosecute her, and a judgement is expected imminently.\n\n[Alabama's new plan to ban abortion could jail doctors. In some countries, laws already do.]\n\nPro-choice campaigners here have pledged solidarity with their counterparts in the United States and are calling for the liberalization of British laws that date back to the 19th century.\n\nEmma Campbell, co-chair of Alliance for Choice, an abortion rights group in Northern Ireland, said that it's surprising to see people in Britain who are \"flabbergasted at what's happening in Alabama but have never mentioned Northern Ireland, which in effect has a worse law than what is being proposed in Alabama.\"\n\nHer organization wrote a letter of warning to activists in Alabama.\n\n\"You and the people you help might actually get arrested, you might have your homes searched and your workplaces raided. Maybe a GP will inform the police of your illegal behaviour, or a flatmate... either way you really have to know who you can trust with the information about your medical procedure, if you access pills at home because you cannot travel,\" the letter said.\n\nStella Creasy, a Labour lawmaker, said that those in Britain outraged at Alabama should also look to their own backyard.\n\nShe tweeted: \"Hey uk progressive gents -- women in Northern Ireland AS WELL as doctors facing life imprisonment in the UK for an abortion. [Alabama] terrible and our own country reprimanded by the UN for our own human rights abuses. Speak out at home as well as against trump & co.\"\n\nCreasy successfully campaigned for Northern Irish women who travel to other parts of the United Kingdom to have access to funded terminations. Before that change in 2017, a Northern Irish woman who had made her way to England was charged about $1,150 for the procedure.\n\n[How an Irish-American woman's legal case helped spur Ireland's abortion referendum]\n\nSince the Abortion Act of 1967, abortion in Britain has been legal in most circumstances up to 24 weeks, as long as it's signed off by two doctors. That law applies to England, Scotland and Wales, but it does not extend to Northern Ireland, where the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861 still prevails.\n\nPolling by YouGov, conducted shortly after the Republic of Ireland overturned its abortion ban last year, found that 65 percent of people in Northern Ireland say abortion should not be a crime. Support for a right to choose an abortion rises further when a woman's health, rape, incest or fatal fetal abnormality are at issue.\n\nBut those who want to change the law in Northern Ireland have run into multiple obstacles.\n\nThe devolved, power-sharing government that is supposed to lead Northern Ireland fell apart more than two years ago and has not been active since.\n\nIn its absence, the Conservative government in Westminster has rebuffed efforts by lawmakers to repeal sections of the 1861 act, which would decriminalize abortion across the U.K. The Conservatives, who argue that the issue is one for Northern Ireland to decide, are propped up in government by Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which opposes changing the abortion law.\n\nGrainne Teggart, Amnesty UK's Northern Ireland campaign manager, said her group was \"horrified by what we are seeing in the U.S., which is a terrifying roll-back on reproductive rights.\" But she said that the United Kingdom was \"no better\" and called on the British government to \"lead on this issue, not lag behind.\"\n\nRead more\n\n'Derry tonight.

But most attention focused on her offer to have lawmakers vote on whether to have a second referendum, something she had previously ruled out.\n\nMrs. May described the deal as \u201cone last chance\u201d to deliver on the 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union.\n\nIf lawmakers reject it again, she said, \u201cthey are voting to stop Brexit.\u201d She added, \u201cIf they do so, the consequences could hardly be greater.\u201d\n\nEarly reaction among Conservatives and Labour was not encouraging.\n\nThe Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said his party would not support the plan, calling it a \u201crehash of what was discussed before.\u201d Pro-Brexit Conservatives reacted angrily as well, with Jacob Rees-Mogg, a lawmaker and leader of that faction, dismissing it as \u201cworse than before.\u201d\n\nOn the referendum, it was unclear how much of a concession Mrs. May was making. That is because she was offering lawmakers a chance to vote on whether to have a referendum, rather than supporting one herself. And she was vague about what question or questions any referendum would pose.\n\nHer new deal seemed designed to entice pro-Brexit Labour Party lawmakers to support her Brexit blueprint. It includes the opportunity for Parliament to decide on whether to keep a type of customs union with Brussels, eliminating tariffs and reducing checks on goods at frontiers \u2014 a demand of Mr. Corbyn.\n\nBut in moving somewhat closer to Labour\u2019s position, she risked losing Conservative supporters of her plan.\n\nNor was she guaranteeing any new consensus on sensitive issues. Parliament has previously voted against a second referendum, and Mrs. May said she still opposed the idea, making it unlikely there would be sufficient support for it this time. Nor has Parliament yet managed to coalesce around any plan to stay in a customs union with the bloc.\n\nThe vote on legislation to leave the bloc, known as the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, is scheduled for the week beginning June 3. It is likely to be the final significant act of Mrs. May\u2019s tenure, as she has promised to set a date for her departure after the decision, ending almost three troubled years in power.\n\nMrs. May\u2019s latest Brexit deal differs from her previous one in that it offers Labour lawmakers more assurances on European standards on workplace protections and environmental rights.\n\nShe would also allow Parliament the right to demand, at least temporarily, a type of customs union with the bloc that is designed to prevent tariffs and many border checks on industrial goods, but only until the next general election, scheduled for 2022. And she is also offering the opportunity to vote on the second referendum.\n\nFor Conservative Brexit supporters the bill has some sweeteners in that it commits the government to working on technical measures to track goods that would prevent the need for border checks at the Irish border.\n\nCritically, however, this would not guarantee Britain staying out of the so-called Irish backstop, a device to avoid a hard border with Ireland. The backstop would keep the whole of the United Kingdom tied to Europe\u2019s customs rules indefinitely, outraging Brexit supporters who say it defeats the whole purpose of Brexit.\n\nOn Tuesday there was a backlash from hard-line pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers, including Iain Duncan Smith, a former party leader.\n\n\u201cThe backstop is still there, it\u2019s a customs union in all but name and it puts Brussels firmly in control of our destiny,\u201d he said in a statement, adding that there was \u201cnothing new or bold about this bad buffet of non-Brexit options,\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday Mrs. May at least secured support from her fractured cabinet for her plan, no mean feat in itself. Yet, in Parliament, the math does not appear to have changed for Mrs. May \u2014 at least not for the better.\n\nHer Conservatives are braced for a humiliating defeat in European elections this week, confronted by the challenge of the Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage, who wants Britain to leave the European Union fast, without any deal if necessary.\n\nSeveral of those vying to succeed Mrs. May are already arguing the same hard Brexit line. As a result, several hard-line pro-Brexit supporters within Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party, who reluctantly supported the last of her three efforts to get the plan through Parliament, are indicating they will revert to their earlier hostility.\n\nMark Francois, a prominent member of the hard-line Brexit faction told the BBC that the opposition to Mrs. May\u2019s deal was \u201cgoing up, not down.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless she is rescued by a Marxist,\u201d said Mr. Francois, referring to Mr. Corbyn, \u201cthe Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead on arrival.\u201d", "date": "2019-05-27", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/world/europe/theresa-may-referendum-brexit.html", "title": "Theresa May\u2019s New Brexit Bid: A Second Referendum", "authors": [], "dataType": "news", "dateTime": null, "eventUri": null, "image": null, "idDuplicate": false, "lang": "eng", "sentiment": null, "sim": null, "source": null, "time": null, "uri": null, "wgt": null}]
