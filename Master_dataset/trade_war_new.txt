Pain of Tariffs Tests Farmers' Faith in Trump", "body": "OSSEO, Wis. -- From the start, President Trump's combative trade strategy toward China has carried the promise that short-term pain inflicted on farmers would be worth the longer-term gains for American producers, from agriculture to technology.\n\nAs the trade war intensifies, faith in that proposition among the president's most stalwart rural fans is being tested more than ever.\n\n\"How long is short-term?\" Shane Goplin, a sixth-generation farmer growing soybeans and corn in west-central Wisconsin, wondered as he maneuvered his 16-row John Deere planter.\n\nChina was the largest buyer of American soybeans until tit-for-tat tariffs all but halted the flow. And this month, souring prospects for a trade deal again sent prices tumbling. Mr. Trump responded on Thursday by announcing a $16 billion package to help those hurt by the dispute.\n\nThe strategy may help shore up farmers' support for Mr. Trump before the 2020 election, but it leaves them with a perplexing question: What does success ultimately look like?\n\nDespite the strain on Mr. Goplin's family bank account and peace of mind, he backs the president's tactics. \"I get why he's doing it,\" he said over the tractor's whir and beeps. \"America has been bullied.\" And if the trade war persisted through the election next year, he added, \"I would be O.K. with that.\"\n\nFederal help is \"very important,\" Mr. Goplin said. The administration's previous $12 billion package of emergency aid meant the difference between profit and loss on his soybeans.\n\nJudging whether an agreement will prove worth the cost, though, is trickier to calculate. Several farmers said that if Mr. Trump declared he had struck a good deal with China, they would take his word for it.\n\n\"I don't think he'll flinch until he gets what he wants,\" said Lorenda Overman, a crop and pig farmer in eastern North Carolina. \"He doesn't mind playing hardball.\"\n\nOther growers suggested that a bump in soybean prices or a drop in the country's trade deficit with China would signal a victory.\n\nLike other farmers throughout the Midwest and South, Mr. Goplin worries, as the standoff with China continues, that soybean producers like Brazil and Argentina could permanently displace American suppliers.\n\nThat is a risk, he said -- like the extreme weather, tight credit and volatile prices that have whipsawed farmers' fortunes over the past decade. And with declining profits, heavier-than-normal debt loads and rising farm bankruptcies in the Midwest, Mr. Goplin, 45, understands that for some growers, it is already too late.\n\nHe had finished planting 500 acres of soybeans this month, a few days after the president announced on Twitter that he was imposing additional tariffs on China. Now, under a postcard-perfect cerulean sky, Mr. Goplin was spending 16 to 18 hours a day getting corn into 2,000 acres of soil. After he completed a patch, he folded the retractable 20-foot-long planting tubes as if they were butterfly wings and got ready to drive to the next field.\n\nFor him, one measure of success would be a sharp reduction in the nation's soybean surplus -- known as the crop carry-over. Last month, the Department of Agriculture forecast that the soybean carry-over would reach 895 million bushels in September, more than twice what it was in 2018.\n\nIn that sense, American farmers are victims of their own success, producing more grain and food than the world market can absorb. At the same time, farmers in other countries, sometimes aided by government subsidies or import quotas, are scrambling for a share of the market, further pushing down prices.\n\nMr. Goplin talked about the tangle of trade and oversupply with his friend Joe Bragger, a sixth-generation dairy farmer in nearby Buffalo County.\n\nThey sat at Mr. Bragger's kitchen table drinking bottles of Moon Man beer as Mr. Bragger's wife, Noel, prepared burgers and potato salad. A teacher, she also cares for the farm's 32,000 pullets.\n\nMr. Bragger, 53, a large man with an infectious laugh, has a voice that squeaks like a backyard swing set when he gets excited. He had just returned from Altoona, Wis., where he listened to Vice President Mike Pence speak at what Mr. Bragger called a \"pep rally.\"\n\n\"We've been in it for -- how long, Shane? -- two years now, squabbling and tweeting,\" Mr. Bragger said of this administration's brawling over trade. \"I can tolerate a few more. \"\n\nMr. Goplin laughed. \"Last Sunday's tweet, it cost ...\" He paused, recalling that the day after Mr. Trump warned on Twitter that he was putting additional tariffs on Chinese goods, the price of a bushel of soybeans dropped more than 10 cents.\n\n\"How much did it cost you?\" Mr. Bragger asked.\n\nMr. Goplin replied: \"$40,000. It was a $40,000 tweet.\"\n\nMr. Pence used his trip to Wisconsin to make a pitch for the administration's trade deal with Mexico and Canada, a pact awaiting congressional approval that the vice president said would help farmers.\n\nTo Mr. Bragger, who with his family owns 330 cows and 1,300 acres where he plants corn, soybeans and hay crops for his livestock, this latest North America trade deal is a \"distraction.\" For a dairy farmer, he said, the difference between the previous trade treaty with Canada and the Trump administration's new one could be produced by a single large Wisconsin farm.\n\nThat doesn't mean he is against the new treaty. He just thinks it is insignificant compared with the real problem, oversupply.\n\nYet the comparison with the Canadian deal raises a question: Could the prolonged dispute with China produce a similar outcome, a relatively trivial gain -- only in this case, one that carries devastating costs for some soybean farmers?\n\n\"At the end of the day, fixing some of these other trade deals for the rest of our country, I'm O.K. with it,\" Mr. Bragger said. \"I'm not going to say don't finish it,\" he said of the China conflict. \"The whole world is watching. I'll support the trade war to the end.\"\n\nMr. Bragger and Mr. Goplin acknowledged that other farmers were in worse shape. Mr. Goplin, for example, locked in higher prices on much of this year's corn and soy crops.\n\n\"If I didn't market anything right, and didn't have any protection on the majority of my farm, I'd be scared to death,\" Mr. Goplin said.\n\nMany farmers are. In North Carolina, Ms. Overman, 57, said she could not handle another bad year. Last season, she lost $450,000 when most of her wheat and soybeans were wiped out by a hurricane, the second in three years.\n\nHer son and son-in-law have both come home to farm. \"But neither of them wants to plant one grain because they see no future in it,\" she said. \"They would be seventh generation, but they're tired of going to the bank and getting a loan and not being able to pay it back.\"\n\nEach bushel of soybeans costs her about $10.35 to grow, she said. The sale price last week, when her family finished planting 1,500 acres of early beans, was $8.03. This month, after exhausting their credit, Ms. Overman and her husband had to borrow on their life insurance to pay the bills.\n\n\"I'm feeling more like this short-term pain is already long-term pain,\" she said.\n\nMs. Overman thinks the president will get a good deal with China, but she worries that it will not be in time for her farm. \"The way to make it worth it,\" she said, \"is to sign a deal, and then backtrack to try to compensate for losses.\"\n\nMr. Goplin, too, said he believed that Mr. Trump would do all he could to help. \"It makes me feel really good to hear Trump say farmers are important to this country,\" he said. \"That's what makes me want to stick with the president.\"\n\nFor now, he is grateful that he has only to walk across the road to sell half of his corn crop to his neighbor, a dairy farmer who uses the chopped cobs to feed the cows. As for his soybeans, he will sell them to the local co-op and has no idea where they end up in the global supply chain.\n\n\"The happiest day of the year for me is when I get the crop loan paid off,\" Mr. Goplin said. \"That means I can live to farm another day. If I can farm another year, I won.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patricia_cohen@nytimes.com", "name": "Patricia Cohen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/22/autossell/Screen-Shot-2019-05-21-at-6/Screen-Shot-2019-05-21-at-6-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.png", "eventUri": "eng-4811504", "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 296385000}, {"uri": "1144187790", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-24", "time": "04:22:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-24T04:22:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/us/politics/on-politics-trump-trade-war.html", "title": "On Politics: The Trade War Is Here to Stay", "body": "Good Friday morning.

Benchmark indexes in China, Germany, France and the United States all dropped. American crude oil prices were down roughly 5 percent, amid growing concern that the ongoing trade war would start to drag on global economic demand. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level this year, in a sign investors were pricing in lower levels of growth and inflation.\n\nHopes for a quick resolution to the China trade fight faded further this week, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying on Wednesday that no additional meetings with Beijing are scheduled and that he is encouraging American firms to reorient their supply chains and source their products elsewhere.\n\nChina's president Xi Jinping this week called for the Chinese people to begin a modern \"long march,\" invoking a time of hardship from the country's history as it braces for a protracted trade war with the United States.\n\n\"The tone of rhetoric that political leaders in both countries have adopted also suggests that it will take time to restore the U.S.-China relationship to where it was prior to the breakdown in talks, let alone to reach the point where a detailed agreement can be finalized,\" Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a research note on Wednesday.\n\n\"I am growing more and more skeptical that there is a place where the two sides can come to a deal,\" said Edward Alden, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"If I look at the positions the two sides have taken at the moment, I do not see a path to a deal.\"\n\nMore companies have been pulling back from doing business with Chinese firms, especially multinationals that provided services to Huawei, the telecommunications equipment giant. The Trump administration announced last week that it would blacklist Huawei over security concerns, prompting Google and mobile carriers to say they would no longer do business with it.\n\nThe Huawei ban, coupled with Mr. Trump's decision to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods and begin the process to tax another $300 billion have exacerbated tensions with Beijing. It has vowed to further retaliate on American products, particularly agricultural goods.\n\nIn a note Wednesday, analysts from Nomura Global Markets Research said their baseline scenario was that Mr. Trump would put a 25 percent tariff on all Chinese exports to the United States by the end of 2019, most likely after he is scheduled to meet with Mr. Xi Jinping at the G-20 in late June.\n\nMore restrictions on dealing with Chinese tech companies could come soon. The New York Times reported Tuesday that the Trump administration is considering another ban on American companies supplying components to Hikvision, a Chinese surveillance camera maker that has been criticized for playing a role in the Chinese government's monitoring and repression of Uighurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic minority.\n\nThe Commerce Department said Monday that it would allow Huawei to continue doing business with American companies for 90 days to prevent disruption to mobile networks that use the company's equipment. But many companies are quickly announcing plans to exit their relationships with Huawei. In addition to Google, which announced that it would cut off support to Huawei for Android hardware and software services, as well as popular applications like Maps and Gmail, German supplier Infeon announced a similar ban. The benchmark index of American semiconductor stocks fell more than 2 percent in early trading, as investors continued to grapple with Trump administration efforts to restrict sales to Huawei.\n\n[Read more about the fallout in financial markets on Thursday.]\n\nMr. Trump has been fighting several trade wars at once, wielding tariffs against metals from Europe, Japan, Canada and Mexico as well as goods from China. In response, trading partners have hit back at American farmers, imposing punishing tariffs on everything from peanut butter to soybeans to orange juice.\n\nOver the last week, the Trump administration has moved to resolve or delay trade conflicts on other fronts, to better focus its efforts on Beijing.\n\nOn Thursday, the Agriculture Department said it would provide up to $16 billion in aid to farmers hurt by Chinese trade retaliation. The amount \"is in line with the estimated impacts of unjustified retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods and other trade disruptions,\" the department said in a statement.\n\nThe new program will make $14.5 billion in direct payments to producers, channeled through the Commodity Credit Corporation, a program that helps shore up American farmers by buying their crops. The payments will be made to agricultural producers for a wide range of products, from soybeans and cotton to chickpeas and cherries, in up to three tranches, beginning in late July or early August.\n\nThe government will also implement a $1.4 billion program to purchase surplus commodities affected by the trade war and distribute them to food banks, schools and other programs for the poor, as well as put another $100 million toward developing new export markets for American farmers.\n\nThe financial support comes after the administration handed out $12 billion in emergency relief for farmers last year, also funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation.\n\n\"China hasn't played by the rules for a long time and President Trump is standing up to them, sending the clear message that the United States will no longer tolerate their unfair trade practices, which include non-tariff trade barriers and the theft of intellectual property,\" Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, said in a statement.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump has insisted any pain will be short-lived and worth the price, administration officials have grown concerned that the president could lose the support of farmers, an important political constituency, ahead of the 2020 election. Those worries helped spur Mr. Trump last week to suddenly drop steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which agreed in turn to withdraw stiff levies on American farm goods.\n\nAfter two years of steadily escalating its trade fights on front after front, the Trump administration appears to be recognizing that the window for cutting deals with allies before the 2020 election is closing. According to administration officials and lawmakers, the president and his top advisers are increasingly feeling that, on the trade front, too many issues remained unresolved and, that trade wars -- like military wars -- are best waged one front at a time.\n\nThat thinking pushed the president and his advisers to decide to delay for six months a decision about imposing tariffs on automobiles around the world, and to reverse their position last week on the tariffs they had levied on Canadian and Mexican metal. It was one of the few times the president has chosen to lift a tariff, instead of imposing new ones.\n\nRobert Lighthizer, the president's top trade adviser, had for months been trying to persuade Canada and Mexico to agree to permanent caps on the amount of metal they send to the United States. But when progress toward a sweeping trade deal with China unexpectedly stalled earlier this month, Mr. Lighthizer decided it was time to try to bring to a close the battle he had been waging in North America, the better to focus on the long war with China, according to people familiar with the deliberations.\n\nHe reached out to Canadian and Mexican officials, offering a deal in which the United States would lift its tariffs if the countries would agree to prevent future surges of metal into the United States market, these people said. If those surges happened, the United States could reimpose tariffs of 10 percent on aluminum and 25 percent on steel on the specific products affected. And Canada and Mexico would agree that, if they retaliated, it would only be on American metal and not on American farmers.\n\nOn Monday, Canada and Mexico officially lifted the tariffs they had imposed on American pork, milk, cheese, wine and other products, a major relief to American farmers who count the countries as two of their top three export markets, in addition to China.\n\nThe collateral damage to farmers from the trade clash with China now looms as a potential obstacle to the president's re-election. China's tariffs against products like soybeans and beef and a recent move to cancel a major pork order have hit swing states, including Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin, especially hard.\n\nA survey of 400 American farmers by Purdue University and the CME Group, a global markets company, showed that sentiment plunged in April, stemming from concerns about worsening tensions with China. Only 28 percent of farmers surveyed said that they believed a soybean dispute with China would be resolved by July 1, down from 45 percent in March, while 74 percent of those surveyed said now was a \"bad time\" to make big farm investments.\n\n\"Farmers are becoming increasingly anxious over their future financial performance,\" said James Mintert, the survey's principal investigator and director of Purdue University's Center for Commercial Agriculture.\n\nThe president is increasingly focused on rural communities as he looks ahead to a fight with the Democratic nominee for the 2020 election.\n\nMr. Trump's political advisers have pointed to the rapid rise of Joseph R. Biden Jr. to the top of Democrats' 2020 field, powered, in part, by the former vice president's popularity with blue-collar voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, as a reason to mitigate the pain on farms and factories of tariffs in the Midwest, current and former administration officials said.\n\nTom Vilsack, a former agriculture secretary who now represents the dairy industry, said on Friday that the removal of the tariffs was an important step but that passage of the revised North American trade agreement and new trade deals with China and Japan remain most crucial to reviving the dairy sector.\n\n\"With the difficulties experienced with the China talks, it was fair to assume that the administration needed to have some positive news coming out of the trade side of the shop,\" Mr. Vilsack said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/23/business/23DC-TRADE-promo/23DC-TRADE-promo-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v2.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800969", "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 296329140}, {"uri": "1143567051", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "12:19:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T12:19:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5333333611488342, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/us/politics/trump-administration-farm-aid.html", "title": "Trump Administration to Announce Farm Aid to Ease Pain of Trade War", "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is preparing to announce a substantial aid package for farmers as early as Thursday, one of several recent moves aimed at mollifying an important political constituency hurt by President Trump's trade war.\n\nMr. Trump has been fighting several trade wars at once, wielding tariffs against metals from Europe, Japan, Canada and Mexico as well as goods from China. In response, trading partners have hit back at American farmers, imposing punishing tariffs on everything from peanut butter to soybeans to orange juice.\n\nWith no end in sight to several of Mr. Trump's trade fights, particularly China, administration officials have grown concerned that the president could lose the support of farmers ahead of the 2020 election. Those worries helped spur Mr. Trump last week to suddenly drop steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which agreed in turn to withdraw stiff levies on American farm goods.\n\nThe administration will attempt to further cushion the blow with a second bailout package aimed at helping farmers who have lost sales and market share as a result of the trade war. On Thursday, the White House was preparing to welcome farmers for a meeting where it expected to announce a generous bailout.\n\nThe measures are aimed at giving Mr. Trump the ability to continue his trade fight with China, which shows no signs of easing and could continue for months, if not years. Tensions between Washington and Beijing have worsened in recent weeks as the Trump administration increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, prepared to tax another $300 billion and placed Huawei, the Chinese telecom equipment giant, on a United States blacklist.\n\nA spokesperson from the Department of Agriculture said Wednesday that details on a new farming support program would be forthcoming shortly, but cautioned farmers to avoid changing their planting decisions until the details had been clarified.\n\nAfter two years of steadily escalating its trade fights on front after front, the Trump administration appears to be recognizing that the window for cutting deals with allies before the 2020 election is closing.

The United States signed that deal with Canada and Mexico late last year, but it still needs to be ratified by legislatures in all three countries.\n\nIt had become increasingly clear that the metal tariffs, which the administration once viewed as leverage to getting a revised Nafta, had become an obstacle to its resolution. Republican lawmakers, along with policymakers in Canada and Mexico, have insisted the tariffs come off before the trade pact was passed into law.\n\nAlso championing their removal was Vice President Mike Pence, who had also been pushing the president to lift the metal tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Mr. Pence, who advocated free trade policies while serving as governor of Indiana, has been touring the United States to promote the passage of the Trump administration's revised North American free trade pact and brought back stories to the White House about manufacturers and farmers who were hurt by tariffs.\n\nThe changes, while helpful, are likely to fall short of propelling the new United States Mexico Canada Agreement through the Democrat-controlled House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats have raised concerns about the deal, arguing that its labor and environmental provisions do not go far enough, and calling for the administration to roll back protections for pharmaceutical companies that Democrats say will complicate their effort to make health care more affordable.\n\nThe administration had been hoping for a Congressional vote on their trade bill this summer. But Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats are in no particular rush to give the president a major domestic policy victory in 2020. She has told associates that she is looking for a way to get to yes, while at the same time depriving Mr. Trump of a domestic policy victory she believes he lucked into.\n\nMr. Lighthizer has a good relationship with the speaker, and other Democrats, but recently he had begun to vent his frustrations about the pace of the talks, according to two senior administration officials involved on the issue.\n\nThat could pose problems for farmers who are depending on the revised pact, which includes more access to Canada's dairy market.\n\nTom Vilsack, a former agriculture secretary who now represents the dairy industry, said on Friday that the removal of the tariffs was an important step but that passage of the revised North American trade agreement and new trade deals with China and Japan remain most crucial to reviving the dairy sector.\n\n\"With the difficulties experienced with the China talks, it was fair to assume that the administration needed to have some positive news coming out of the trade side of the shop,\" Mr. Vilsack said.\n\nBoth the aid package for farmers and the lifting of tariffs on Canada and Mexico are also likely to cultivate some good will for the administration with Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa senator and farmer who also heads the powerful Senate Finance Committee, which will play a role in the deal's passage.\n\nMr. Grassley has been outspoken in his opposition to the metal tariffs and his defense of farmers. On April 28, The Wall Street Journal published an op-ed by the senator arguing that the tariffs would make it virtually impossible to pass the deal, and entitled \"Trump's Tariffs End or His Trade Deal Dies.\"\n\n\"If these tariffs aren't lifted, USMCA is dead,\" Mr. Grassley wrote. \"There is no appetite in Congress to debate USMCA with these tariffs in place.\"\n\nMr. Grassley -- whom Mr. Trump views as the archetypal representative of the Midwest's farming industry -- had given Mr. Lighthizer and Mr. Pence advance notice that he planned to publish the piece. And the article, appearing in one of the few print spaces -- The Wall Street Journal editorial page -- to which Mr. Trump pays close attention, had an impact.\n\nMr. Lighthizer quietly suggested to Mr. Grassley that the tariffs would be dropped.

His trade war has hurt many of the farmers who make up his political base, and he is eager to make good on a 2016 campaign promise to rewrite trade deals in America's favor.\n\n\"I'm pleased to announce we've just reached agreement with Canada and Mexico. We'll be selling our product into those countries without the imposition of tariffs,\" Mr. Trump said on Friday.\n\nThe United States trade representative said in a statement that the metal tariffs would be removed and both Mexico and Canada \"had agreed on the removal of all retaliatory tariffs imposed on American goods by those countries.\"\n\nThe easing of trade tensions in North America could give Mr. Trump more leeway as he pursues an ambitious trade fight with China, which has imposed tariffs on American products in retaliation for the president's levies on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods. Mr. Trump on Wednesday announced sweeping restrictions against Chinese telecom companies like Huawei, and he has threatened to tax all Chinese imports, prompting concerns from farmers and other businesses caught in the cross-fire.\n\nOn Friday, it became clear that pressure to reach an accord with Canada and Mexico before the 2020 elections outweighed the president's affection for the steel and aluminum tariffs he imposed last year.\n\nThe metal tariffs are linked to a broader free trade agreement, the newly negotiated Nafta, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Mr. Trump had described the tariffs as a source of leverage in negotiating a revision to that deal, which has yet to be ratified by legislatures in all three countries.\n\nBut both Republicans and Democrats had said they would not sign off on that deal until the White House removed metal tariffs on Canada and Mexico. They argue that the levies are raising costs for American companies and consumers, and that Canadian and Mexican retaliation is hurting American farmers and businesses.\n\nA congressional aide who has been involved in the talks between the three countries said the White House was growing increasingly sensitive to pressure from Republicans in rural states whose farmers have been suffering from reprisal that diminished their access to sell in neighboring markets. Their problems were compounded when talks with China broke down this month, this person said.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who has spent weeks traversing Midwestern states to sell the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in Congress, relayed the complaints of manufacturers and farmers hurt by the tariffs to Mr. Trump, telling him, \"We've got to get moving on this.\"\n\nWhile rescinding the metal tariffs will remove one important obstacle to the passage of the trade deal, others remain. House Democrats have insisted that the pact include more labor and environmental protections.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, is in no particular rush to give the president a major domestic policy victory in 2020, according to people familiar with her views.\n\nJes\u00fas Seade, the under secretary for North America at Mexico's Foreign Ministry, said that he hoped that ending the dispute would give \"an extra push\" toward ratifying the agreement. Mexico will lift its retaliatory tariffs in a couple of days, he said.\n\nSpeaking from Stelco, a steel producer in Hamilton, Ontario, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said on Friday that the deal was \"pure good news\" and would help clear the way for the passage of the agreement. \"We are very optimistic we will be able to move forward in coming weeks,\" he said.\n\nAs the White House eased tensions with Canada and Mexico on Friday, it continued to pressure allies elsewhere, including Europe and Japan. Those governments are still not exempt from the steel and aluminum tariffs, and they are likely to bear the brunt of auto tariffs that could reach 25 percent, should Mr. Trump opt to impose them.\n\nThe White House's announcement Friday of a delay in determining whether to impose levies on foreign automobiles delivered a temporary reprieve to global automakers and auto suppliers, which had been bracing for punishing tariffs on millions of cars imported into the United States each year. But it also set up a tense six-month period for the White House to reach trade deals with Japan, Europe and other nations that have already been complicated by mistrust and disagreements.\n\nIn a proclamation Monday, Mr. Trump said that imports of foreign cars and car parts were causing harm to the American automobile industry and threatening national security and that other countries had 180 days to address the problem through trade agreements with the United States.\n\nIf agreements \"to address the national security threat\" are not reached, Mr. Trump said he would determine \"whether and what further action needs to be taken,\" a step that could include imposing 25 percent tariffs on foreign cars.\n\nCar companies and industry groups said that a delay did not go far enough and that Mr. Trump should abandon any plan to impose car tariffs.\n\n\"The continued threat of tariffs on cars and auto parts only creates more uncertainty weakening our economy,\" said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nMany outside the administration have criticized the linkage of cars with national security, pointing out that the bulk of American auto imports come from the country's closest allies. Mexico, Japan, Canada, Germany and South Korea were together responsible for more than 85 percent of American automotive imports in 2018. Canada and Mexico have negotiated exclusions to the car tariffs as part of their earlier trade negotiations, but it is unclear if car tariffs will affect other countries, including South Korea.\n\nIn a statement, Toyota called the White House's announcement \"a major setback for American consumers, workers and the auto industry,\" saying that it \"sends a message to Toyota that our investments are not welcomed, and the contributions from each of our employees across America are not valued.\"\n\n\"The idea that U.S. automakers are threatened by automotive imports is fundamentally flawed and ill conceived,\" said John Bozzella, the president of Global Automakers, which represents foreign car brands. \"No automaker or auto parts supplier asked for this 'protection.'\"\n\nThe United States has struggled to make headway in preliminary negotiations with the European Union, which has balked at Mr. Trump's demands to allow more agricultural products like chicken and cheese into Europe.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly criticized Europe for flooding the American market with cars while limiting imports of United States vehicles, and has called for revised trade terms that make the relationship more fair. But he also previously rejected a more straightforward proposal from Europe to simply scrap automotive tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nSpeaking to the National Association of Realtors on Friday at a Washington hotel, the president denounced the European Union for putting up trade barriers to American farm products and cars.\n\n\"The European Union treats us, I would say, worse than China. They're just smaller,\" he said. \"They send Mercedes-Benzes in here like they are cookies.\"\n\nThe European Commission said in a statement Monday that it would work constructively with American partners. \"Neither the U.S. nor the E.U. can have an interest to enter a trade conflict.\"\n\nThe Trump administration wants Europe to buy more American farm products, like meat and dairy, and says a deal without agriculture will not pass Congress. But Europe insists that agriculture is not on the table.\n\nReaching a deal with Europe in six months could be difficult, especially given that elections for the European Parliament next week are expected to strengthen protectionist parties on both the left and the right. Leaders of the Green coalition in Parliament say they will not sign trade agreements with countries that have not ratified the Paris climate change accord, which Mr. Trump has pulled out of.\n\nThe United States and Japan have also been discussing a bilateral trade deal that could give American farmers more access to Japan's market. But those talks, which began nearly two years after Mr. Trump pulled out of a multilateral trade deal with Japan known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, also have yet to move beyond the initial stages.\n\nJapanese officials say that they are counting on the close relationship between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to keep trade negotiations from souring between the two countries. Mr. Trump is scheduled to visit Japan next week, and his hosts are planning a full slate of high-level hospitality. That includes a state dinner with the new emperor and empress, rounds of golf and a visit to a sumo wrestling championship, where Mr. Trump will award the winner's trophy.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/us/17DC-AUTOTARRIFF-promo-sub/17DC-AUTOTARRIFF-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 296235720}, {"uri": "1141957321", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "03:15:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T03:15:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4980392158031464, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/world/asia/xi-jinping-china-trade.html", "title": "China Faces New 'Long March' as Trade War Intensifies, Xi Jinping Says", "body": "BEIJING -- President Xi Jinping of China has called for the Chinese people to begin a modern \"long march,\" invoking a time of hardship from the country's history as it braces for a protracted trade war with the United States.\n\nMr. Xi's call, made on Monday, referred to the Long March, a grueling 4,000-mile, one-year journey undertaken by Communist Party forces in 1934 as they fled the Nationalist army under Chiang Kai-shek. From there, they regrouped and eventually took control of China in 1949, making the Long March one of the party's foundational legends.\n\nThe comments appear intended to stir the spirit of the Chinese people as the Trump administration continues to press China on trade. But they also seem to acknowledge that the Chinese public could face difficult times ahead. The tariffs come as Beijing tries to lift the economy out of a slowdown, and as a variety of unrelated factors raise the prices of basic food items like pork and fruit for the average Chinese shopper.\n\nSpeaking at the site of the start of the Long March in Jiangxi Province, Mr. Xi told a crowd of cheering locals that \"now there is a new long march, and we should make a new start.\"\n\nHe did not mention the trade war directly, and Mr. Xi has used the term \"the new Long March\" in speeches before to exhort officials, military officials or ordinary citizens to follow his policies. But the visit, broadcast on state-run television on Tuesday, came as tensions flare between the world's two biggest economies. Among the officials with Mr. Xi was Liu He, his chief economic adviser and top trade negotiator.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Xi told another audience in Jiangxi that the country \"must be conscious of the long-term and complex nature of various unfavorable factors at home and abroad, and properly prepare for the various difficult situations.\"\n\nThe trade war shows little sign of letting up. In the latest move, the Trump administration is considering placing a Chinese company called Hikvision on a list that would limit its ability to procure American technology like chips and software to meet its needs. The company, which provides equipment for China's growing surveillance state, said in a statement on Wednesday that it \"has never in the past done any business that requires us to violate human rights.\"\n\nAt a daily news briefing on Wednesday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said, \"China opposes the U.S. practice of abusing state power and arbitrarily discrediting and suppressing foreign enterprises, including Chinese enterprises.\"\n\nIn one of the first gestures hinting at a potential opening salvo, Mr. Xi on Monday visited a rare earths mine in the city of Ganzhou, which some observers saw as an attempt to remind Mr. Trump of the leverage that China has when it comes to certain resources. Rare earths are found in many of the electronics that the world uses every day, and China is the largest source. China has used its control of rare earths to exert pressure before, most notably in 2010 when it halted all exports to Japan for two months over a territorial dispute.\n\nMr. Xi later called on the industry to continue to \"intensify efforts\" to develop rare earths, calling them a \"strategic resource.\" At a media briefing on Wednesday, officials told reporters not to read too much into the visit, adding that it was a routine visit.\n\nThe Chinese state media has ratcheted up nationalistic rhetoric in the past few days, comparing the trade war to the Korean War, during which Chinese troops were in direct combat with American forces. Over the weekend, China's national movie channel, CCTV-6, ran back-to-back films about the Korean War, saying that the footage was \"echoing present times.\"\n\nThe central point of those films is that \"there's no equal negotiation without fighting,\" Hu Xijin, the editor of Global Times, a newspaper owned by the Communist Party, wrote on Twitter over the weekend.\n\nChina in the past has successfully rallied its people to target businesses owned by Japanese and South Korean companies during disputes with those countries. With the trade war with the United States, China has to move more carefully. American products are often made in Chinese factories, and China needs its consumers to keep spending as it tries to turn around its growth slump.\n\nChinese consumers also have more immediate concerns. Even as the economic slowdown appeared to be stabilizing, certain living costs have risen steeply.\n\nA vicious African swine fever that swept across China has led to more than a million pigs being culled, driving up the price of pork. A steep increase in the price of vegetables and fruit has led many people to complain online that they no longer have \"fruit freedom\" -- the ability to buy as much fruit as they like.\n\n\"Everyone has personally felt a rise in prices,\" said Zhang Lifan, a historian and former businessman.\n\n\"Normal people will have to bear the consequences of the Chinese trade war. There is no way to fight this, and the new Long March is not sustainable,\" Mr. Zhang said.\n\nFor people like Xu Jifeng, who works for an American telecommunications company in Beijing, the back and forth between China and the United States has little bearing on his day-to-day life. He said he would most likely choose a Huawei phone over an Apple phone the next time he needs to upgrade. But he was more interested in talking about the rising cost of produce.\n\nMr. Xu, 44, said the price of a watermelon has gone up by more than a dollar.\n\n\"I think this reflects the bad overall state of the economy,\" Mr. Xu said. \"The government says it's just temporary and that they will keep it under control.\"\n\n\"But coming at the same time as these China-U.S. trade frictions, I think fruit prices must be showing the effects.\"\n\nIn April, the price of pork jumped 14 percent compared with a year earlier, while the broader food consumer price inflation rose 6.1 percent, according to government statistics. By the end of last week, the average price of a basket of fruit had hit a nearly five-year high of $1.10 a kilogram, according to official statistics.\n\nSo many people online were talking about the rising costs of fruit that #fruitfreedom became a top trending topic on Weibo, China's most popular social media site.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics blamed the weather, and said that the price increase was short-term. \"The price increase of fresh fruits will not continue to be high,\" a spokeswoman for the bureau said.\n\nPeople have responded online by posting photographs of fruit with commentary about how much less they can afford. One woman complained that her usual haul of fruit from the supermarket was costing her nearly as much as she would pay for a new lipstick.\n\nOne person wrote on Weibo, \"Now the price of fruit is really more expensive than meat. From now on, when I eat apples, I don't dare to peel the skin, not even spit out the seeds.\"\n\nAnother asked \"Where is fruit freedom? All I can achieve is cold water freedom.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexandra_stevenson@nytimes.com", "name": "Alexandra Stevenson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/22/world/22china-xi1/22china-xi1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4801161", "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 296190900}, {"uri": "1141791853", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:20:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7803921699523926, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/business/trump-china-tariffs.html", "title": "Trump Could Raise Tariffs on China. Here's How China Could Respond.", "body": "A week ago, the United States and China looked as if they were going to reach a deal to end their trade war. Today, they are trying to salvage their many months of negotiations.\n\nVice Premier Liu He, a senior Chinese economic policy maker, is set to begin two days of negotiations in Washington on Thursday aimed at heading off an escalation. On Sunday, President Trump accused China of trying to renegotiate the nearly finished trade deal and threatened to impose more tariffs on Friday. Chinese officials have said they would respond, without specifying how. The prospect of a deepening trade war between the world's two largest economies has scared investors and darkened the global economic outlook.\n\nChina has strongly denied that it reneged on anything. \"Over the past one year's negotiation, our sincerity and kindness is obvious,\" Gao Feng, a Commerce Ministry spokesman, said at a news briefing on Thursday. \"Negotiations are the process of exchanging ideas, solving problems and reaching consensus. The two sides having different views is normal.\"\n\nChina has options if Mr. Trump goes ahead with his threat, including ways to strike at American businesses that go beyond tariffs.\n\n\"We expect China to quickly retaliate with matching tariffs,\" said Jake Parker, a vice president in Beijing for the U.S.-China Business Council, a business advocacy group representing 200 mostly large American companies that do business with China. \"We are also advising our members to prepare for increased customs scrutiny, regulatory enforcement at the local level, and diversification away from U.S. products.\"\n\nStill, Beijing's choices are painful and could hurt the Chinese economy just as much as they could hurt the United States.\n\nTrump's trade threat\n\nPresident Trump said on Sunday that American tariffs of 10 percent on $200 billion in Chinese goods, imposed last September, would rise to 25 percent on Friday. The tariffs would take effect just after midnight on Thursday, meaning the United States could wake up on Friday to an even more damaging trade war. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that the tariffs might be reconsidered if Beijing restored what the United States regards as previous Chinese commitments, and made progress beyond them.\n\nThe president also threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion in Chinese goods, without specifying when.\n\n[China 'broke the deal' on trade, and Trump's retaliation starts Friday.]\n\nMeeting tariffs with tariffs\n\nChina's obvious choice would be higher, and possibly wider, tariffs.\n\nIt could raise the retaliatory tariffs that it imposed on American-made goods last autumn. When President Trump imposed his 10 percent tariffs, Beijing responded by imposing a range of tariffs, from 5 percent to 25 percent, on $60 billion a year of American goods. That covered about two-fifths of Chinese imports from the United States.\n\nChina could also revive import barriers specifically aimed at some of the states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2016 election. In December, amid improved chances for a trade deal, China resumed buying American soybeans after it stopped buying them last summer. China also removed the 25 percent tariff that it had imposed last summer on American-made cars and sport utility vehicles.\n\nFor China, the problem with retaliatory tariffs is that they might not be enough to persuade Washington to relent. China has worked to diversify its economy, but it still depends heavily on exporting manufactured goods abroad, including to the United States. While some American businesses would be pinched by retaliatory Chinese tariffs, the broader economic impact on the United States could be more limited.\n\n[Read more about how China has tried to stabilize its economy recently.]\n\nTariffs are also only applied to a small portion of the prices consumers pay for purchases, so American shoppers wouldn't see big changes in price tags.\n\nChina could broaden its tariffs to cover the one-third of its imports from the United States that it has not yet penalized. These are mainly semiconductors and Boeing aircraft. But Chinese companies need the semiconductors, and there are few rival producers elsewhere for some of them. They would simply have to pay the tariffs and become less competitive.\n\nPutting tariffs on Boeing aircraft poses the same dilemma for Beijing. It would force Chinese airlines to buy from Airbus, the only real alternative supplier. Airbus would then be able to charge much higher prices.\n\nWeaponizing shoppers\n\nAnother option is for the Chinese government to encourage the country's consumers to boycott American products, or to allow such boycotts to be organized at a grass-roots level. China has used this weapon during foreign policy disputes with South Korea and Japan over the past decade.\n\nBut once unleashed, Chinese nationalism could be hard to contain. If a boycott led to anti-American protests in the streets, Beijing's ability to reach deals with the United States would be constrained. A boycott also could hurt China's consumers, by limiting their choices, and hurt the Chinese workers who make American-branded cars, assemble iPhones and brew Starbucks lattes.\n\nChina's other options\n\nIf China really wants to fight back hard, it has other options. But all of them have big potential drawbacks.\n\nIt could delay imports from the United States through elaborate customs inspections and quarantines. China temporarily delayed last year its imports of Lincoln sport utility vehicles by the Ford Motor Company and apples, oranges and cherries from American farmers. It could also send inspectors to check out the business licenses and operations.\n\nIf China wanted to get Mr. Trump's attention in a big way, it could outright hinder the global supply chain. China makes a huge amount of the parts and components that American companies need to produce their finished products. Many American companies have asked trade officials for exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese goods, contending that they are heavily dependent on these products. Lou Jiwei, a former finance minister of China with many connections to the Chinese leadership, suggested at a conference last September that Chinese officials might study the filings and block exports of some of these products.\n\nThat would disrupt corporate supply chains. But it could also permanently damage China's reputation as a reliable supplier for practically every large company in the West. Foreign companies are already re-evaluating their dependence on China as a manufacturing hub.\n\nFinally, China could let the value of its currency, the renminbi, slide sharply against the dollar. That would make China's exports less expensive and more competitive in foreign markets, and could partly offset the cost of higher tariffs.\n\nBut letting the renminbi drop could pose the greatest risks of all. It would make oil and other imports more expensive in China, fanning Chinese inflation at a time when prices are already starting to rise. And if a falling currency prompts Chinese companies and families to evade limits on moving their money overseas, a flood of outbound money could destabilize China's financial system.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keith_bradsher@nytimes.com", "name": "Keith Bradsher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/09/world/09chinaoptions-promo/09chinaoptions-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800969", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 296169600}, {"uri": "1141791852", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:20:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/us/politics/china-trade-tariffs.html", "title": "Trump Increases China Tariffs as Trade Deal Hangs in the Balance", "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump escalated his trade war with China on Friday morning, raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and taking steps to tax nearly all of China's imports as punishment for what he said was Beijing's attempt to \"renegotiate\" a trade deal.\n\nMr. Trump's decision to proceed with the tariff increase came after a pivotal round of trade talks in Washington on Thursday night failed to produce an agreement to forestall the higher levies. The White House said talks would resume again on Friday but it remains uncertain whether the two sides can bridge the differences that have arisen over the past week.\n\nIn his comments at the White House on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Trump vacillated between threatening China and suggesting a deal could still happen. The president said he had received a \"beautiful letter\" from President Xi Jinping of China and would probably speak to him by phone, but said he was more than happy to keep hitting Beijing with tariffs.\n\n[U.S.-China trade war worsens, but global markets find a footing.]\n\n\"I have no idea what's going to happen,\" he said. \"They'll see what they can do, but our alternative is, is an excellent one,\" Mr. Trump added, noting that American tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese products were bringing \"billions\" in to the United States government.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, China's Ministry of Commerce said that the government \"deeply regrets that it will have to take necessary countermeasures.\" It didn't specify what those countermeasures might be.\n\n\"It is hoped that the U.S. and Chinese sides will meet each other halfway and work together\" to resolve their dispute, the statement added.\n\nMarkets in Asia and Europe rose in Friday trading, suggesting investors still believe the two sides can reach a deal.\n\nThe renewed brinkmanship has plunged the world's two largest economies back into a trade war that had seemed on the cusp of ending. The United States and China were nearing a trade deal that would lift tariffs, open the Chinese market to American companies and strengthen China's intellectual property protections. But discussions fell apart last weekend, when China called for substantial changes to the negotiating text that both countries had been using as a blueprint for a sweeping trade pact.\n\nMr. Trump, angered by what he viewed as an act of defiance, responded on Sunday by threatening to raise existing tariffs to 25 percent and impose new ones on an additional $325 billion worth of products. China has said it is prepared to retaliate should those tariffs go into effect.\n\n\"We were getting very close to a deal then they started to renegotiate the deal,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We can't have that.\"\n\nChinese officials said the decision to come to the United States after Mr. Trump's tariff threat showed they are serious about trying to reach a resolution. But it is unclear whether China is willing to make the changes that the Trump administration is demanding, including codifying much of the agreement into Chinese law.\n\n\"I come here facing pressure,\" Liu He, China's vice premier, said on Thursday in an interview with China Central Television in Washington. \"That expresses China's greatest sincerity. And we want to resolve some of the differences we face honestly, confidently and rationally. I think there is hope.\"\n\nAn administration official described Mr. Xi's letter to Mr. Trump as conveying a nice, diplomatic tone but noted that the word \"equality\" was included, suggesting that China believes the United States is demanding too much and that a trade agreement must be more equitable. Mr. Xi also said he believed that his friendship with Mr. Trump would endure the trade dispute.\n\nDespite the overture, the administration official said that this round of talks had the dour feeling of heading toward a breakup. There is a growing sense of disappointment in Mr. Xi being unable to follow through on things that Mr. Trump's trade negotiators thought had been addressed.\n\nMr. Trump's decision to impose 25 percent tariffs on nearly one-third of all Chinese products is the biggest trade action that Mr. Trump has taken so far. The higher tax hits many consumer products that Americans rely on from Beijing, like seafood, luggage and electronics, raising prices for American companies and their customers across a large portion of sectors.\n\nStock markets fell Thursday in the United States, but pared some of those losses after Mr. Trump's comments in the afternoon. The S&P 500 index ended the day down less than 0.5 percent.\n\nTalks resumed at 5 p.m. on Thursday at the offices of the United States trade representative, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump's top trade negotiator, continued them over a dinner with Mr. Liu and some members of the Chinese delegation.\n\nThe new 25 percent rate went into effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday. But the higher tariffs will hit only products that leave China after that time, not those already in transit. That could provide some additional time for the two sides to reach an agreement. Mr. Trump may also be able to rescind the tariffs once a deal is reached, retroactively reversing the higher rates.\n\n\"This week is really a challenge if you've got boats on the ocean,\" said Brian Keare, the field chief information officer at Incorta, who advises companies like Broadcom, Starbucks and Apple on scenario planning amid the uncertainty they face under the Trump administration. \"If I've got 30 days' notice, I can make a smarter decision. If I've got 72 hours, my hands are more tied.\"\n\nChina, which has already placed tariffs on nearly all of America's exports, including agriculture products, has threatened to respond with additional \"countermeasures\" to Mr. Trump's latest tariff.\n\nLyle Benjamin, the president of the Montana Grain Growers Association, said that China had essentially stopped buying American wheat since last year. He was hopeful that a trade truce would change that, but now he expected prices to keep falling.\n\n\"It's highly frustrating, particularly in the agricultural sector, to be collateral damage as we try to achieve these trade goals for other industries,\" Mr. Benjamin said. \"It's a tough game right now and it's tied almost entirely to this trade war.\"\n\nBut Mr. Trump, already emboldened by a healthy American economy, may be encouraged to keep his trade war going given the monthly trade deficit with China fell in March to its lowest level since 2014 as China slowed its exports to America. The overall United States trade deficit with the world increased 1.5 percent in March to $50 billion, as it continued to import more goods and services than it exported worldwide.\n\nMr. Trump has seized on that shrinking deficit as evidence that his trade policy is narrowing the trade deficit and boosting growth, as have some of his supporters.\n\nThe Trump administration has done projections on the effect of the additional tariffs on the economy and believes that the negative effects will be minimal and pale in comparison to those facing China, an administration official said. The White House will consider taking additional measures to mitigate the effects of any retaliatory measures that China takes against America's farmers.\n\n\"To the president's credit, the tariffs are working,\" said Dan DiMicco, the chairman of the trade lobbying group Coalition for a Prosperous America and a former trade adviser to Mr. Trump during his 2016 campaign. \"America's manufacturers and workers are now seeing gains as manufacturing employment rises and China's hold on the U.S. market shrinks.\"\n\nMr. Trump's toughened stance toward China has rattled American businesses, which had been anticipating a trade truce but are now bracing for higher tariffs.\n\n\"Clearly, we think a negotiating strategy based on tariffs is the wrong direction,\" said David French, the senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation.\n\nRetailers wielded their influence successfully in 2017 when Republicans were considering a tax plan that they believed would have harmed their businesses. But when it comes to trade, Mr. French said that the Trump administration had been intransigent about their tariff concerns. To make its point, the retail association has been holding events featuring businesses that are suffering from tariffs in politically important states like Ohio.\n\nMost business groups agree with Mr. Trump that China engages in unfair trade practices. Among the shared concerns is that China needs to protect American intellectual property and curb subsidies for state-owned enterprises. But those businesses, which depend on China for many of the products they rely on and sell, say the economic pain of tariffs makes them a poor negotiating tool.\n\n\"American business continues to have major problems with China's commercial policies, but we simply must find a way to tackle these that doesn't turn our most competitive companies into collateral damage,\" said Peter Robinson, the chief executive of the United States Council for International Business.\n\nMr. Robinson suggested that the United States should team up with other trading partners to pressure China to change its ways and work with the World Trade Organization to adjudicate its complaints.\n\nBut administration officials have begun to run out of patience with China, which they say reneged on several areas of agreement over the weekend. After a meeting last week in Beijing, Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Lighthizer were angered to receive a new draft of the agreement from the Chinese with major revisions to provisions they thought had been agreed to. According to people who have been tracking the talks, Chinese officials determined that many of the concessions they were being asked to make would clash with Chinese laws, which the government was not prepared to change.\n\n\"The administration has been talking to China for months now about specific things that needed to change in Chinese law,\" said Clete Willems, a former member of Mr. Trump's trade team who left recently to become a partner at the law firm Akin Gump. \"The administration was operating under the assumption that some of that would be part of the deal, so to the extent that China is saying that's no longer possible, that is a pretty big reversal.\"\n\nWall Street analysts have been girding for more volatility this week and many have been adjusting their predictions about the likelihood of an all out trade war.\n\n\"The opportunity window for avoiding a trade war is closing fast,\" economists at Citigroup wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThey warned that an increase in tariffs could begin to push up inflation in the United States and tighten financial conditions. A full-blown trade war is expected to be a drag on global economic growth.\n\nThus far, most companies have managed to absorb the brunt of the initial batch of China tariffs, keeping inflation at bay, but analysts said that jumping to a rate of 25 percent is impossible to ignore.\n\n\"Any maneuverability these companies had been using to blunt the impact of these tariffs is very likely exhausted,\" said Henrietta Treyz, the director of economic policy at the investment advisory firm Veda Partners.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/09/business/09DC-CHINATRADE-1/09DC-CHINATRADE-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800969", "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 296169600}, {"uri": "1141791849", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:20:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5529412031173706, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/business/china-trump-trade-tariffs-reaction.html", "title": "China, Defiant but Careful, Promises Aggressive Response to Tariffs", "body": "BEIJING -- When the United States ratcheted up trade tensions with Beijing on Friday, the news was greeted with weariness and foreboding among the people in China who will pay the immediate price: owners of factories big and small.\n\nBrook Chen runs a plant in Shanghai that makes suitcases for brands including Samsonite. More than four-fifths of his orders come from the United States.\n\nThe trade war, now nearly a year old, has already squeezed Mr. Chen's bottom line. American customers insisted that he lower his prices so they wouldn't have to raise theirs. When he contemplates moving production out of China -- to Southeast Asia, for instance -- he worries about losing access to China's vast supply chain and capable work force.\n\n\"This is totally a lose-lose situation,\" Mr. Chen said. \"We lose profits and have to shut down. American importers cannot find effective alternatives that can deliver products with the same quality.\"\n\nThe Chinese government issued a muted response on Friday after President Trump raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. China's Ministry of Commerce vowed to retaliate, although it did not say how or when. Still, global financial markets -- which have been hit by trade tensions in recent days -- rose in hopes of an eventual deal.\n\nChina's heavily controlled news media have been walking a careful line, calling for defiance but not more dramatic action, such as a boycott of American products.\n\nBefore Friday's tariff increase, multiple state media outlets had published a cryptic, anonymously written article with the headline, \"If You Want to Talk, We Can Talk. If You Want to Fight, We'll Fight.\" The article presented China as a calm, neutral presence upon which American policies had, very regrettably, exerted pressure.\n\nChinese people are polite by nature, the article said, yet unafraid of confrontation. \"We are prepared to fight back,\" it said.\n\nThe question for Chinese leaders is how long the higher tariffs will last. China has ways to keep its economy humming, at least in the near term. Negotiators also have time to reach a deal, as the Trump administration effectively delayed the tariff increase by saying they only applied to goods that leave China on Friday or later. Oceangoing goods, in other words, won't get hit by the 25 percent levy until they arrive at American ports over the next few weeks.\n\nStill, China's economy has shown it isn't invulnerable. Some factories are already suffering.\n\n\"You can definitely feel the anxiety,\" said Lu Mengxi, the founder of a winery in northwestern China that sells both domestically and abroad, including in the United States.\n\nWhat began last year as an investigation into China's practices toward American companies operating within its borders has turned into a sprawling conflict that has weighed on financial markets and economic activity across the globe.\n\nWhile analysts widely believe the two countries will eventually reach a deal to avert a trade dispute that could seriously hurt the world economy, the appetite for further conflict seems unabated on both sides.\n\nAmerican companies operating in China have generally chided both countries' governments for using tariffs to bring each other to the negotiating table. On Friday, however, Ker Gibbs, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, sounded more favorably inclined toward the Trump administration's policies and less tolerant of Beijing's.\n\n\"While many of our companies are hurt by the tariffs and ongoing trade tensions, we understand the U.S. government's frustration,\" Mr. Gibbs said in a statement. \"There needs to be a deal that rebalances the economic relationship.\"\n\nFew in China appear to believe that a change of tactics is due, either.\n\n\"It would be easy to do what a small minority of people in China are advocating, and to go along with America on everything,\" Hu Xijin, editor in chief of the state-run newspaper Global Times, wrote in a commentary on Friday. \"But that just won't do. That would not be responsible to the people's interests.\"\n\n\"The trade negotiations have gone on for so long because the two countries' fundamental interests cannot be reconciled,\" Nicole Zhang, 26, an employee at an online travel company, said while shopping in a Beijing mall on Friday. \"National interests are unfeeling things like that. That's just how it is.\"\n\nAt the beginning of the year, China's position was more defensive. Its economic growth slowed in the second half of last year, in part because tariffs hurt business confidence. Since then, the Chinese government has poured billions of dollars into the financial system and pressed state-run banks into service extending credit.\n\nOfficials said last month that the economy grew 6.4 percent in the first quarter of the year, matching the pace from the previous quarter. Industrial output has been solid. Shoppers have opened their wallets.\n\nStill, for many Chinese businesses, especially those that sell overseas, uncertainty remains front of mind. China's exports to all major regions, not only to the United States, grew more slowly in the beginning of this year. Should the trade war intensify further, China may find it increasingly expensive to prop up its economy, and it could face another slowdown or widespread job losses.\n\nThe state news media have worked to reassure the country's consumers. In a headline published on Friday before the tariffs rose, the People's Daily newspaper, which is the Communist Party's mouthpiece, declared that Chinese trade \"has positive momentum and strong driving power.\"\n\nSome companies with business on both sides of the Pacific are trying to stay positive, too. N\u00e9e Lau, the owner of Amourvino Winery in Napa, Calif., said the tariffs China imposed last year had hurt his profits. Still, Mr. Lau said he would rather not raise prices, even if it meant earning less for now. Holding onto his overseas dealers and clients, he said, was more important to the long-term health of his business.\n\n\"The United States and China will definitely come to some kind of agreement. It's just a matter of time,\" Mr. Lau said. \"It's impossible for a war between two superpowers to go on forever.\"\n\nJason Wang, who owns a shoemaker in Fujian Province that sells to the American market, says that what frustrates him is that the tariff negotiations are taking place far from the people, like him, who are most directly affected.\n\nMr. Wang also lamented the nationalist sentiment on both sides that he felt had egged on the two countries' leaders. Americans, he said, probably felt that their country was taking a strong stance by imposing tariffs.\n\n\"And when China fights back, many praise the government for being tough,\" he said.\n\n\"But I think no one actually wins in the end,\" Mr. Wang said. \"Ordinary people on both sides are paying the price.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "raymond_zhong@nytimes.com", "name": "Raymond Zhong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/10/world/10chinareax-1/10chinareax-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800969", "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 296169600}, {"uri": "1141791846", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:20:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4705882370471954, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/world/asia/us-china-trade-war.html", "title": "U.S.-China Trade Standoff May Be Initial Skirmish in Broader Economic War", "body": "WASHINGTON -- A yearlong trade war between the United States and China is proving to be an initial skirmish in an economic conflict that may persist for decades, as both countries battle for global dominance, stature and wealth.\n\nProgress toward a trade agreement nearly collapsed this past week, with both sides hardening their bargaining positions. And even if a trade deal is reached, it may do little to resolve tensions between the world's two largest economies.\n\nThe United States is increasingly wary of China's emerging role in the global economy and the tactics it uses to get ahead, including state-sponsored hacking, acquisitions of high-tech companies in the United States and Europe, subsidies to crucial industries and discrimination against foreign companies.\n\nThe Trump administration has begun trying to limit China's economic influence in the United States and abroad, warning about China's ambitions in increasingly stark terms. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, compared China's ambitions to Russia and Iran in a speech in London last Wednesday, saying Beijing poses \"a new kind of challenge; an authoritarian regime that's integrated economically into the West in ways that the Soviet Union never was.\"\n\nThe United States has been erecting barriers to limit Chinese investment in American companies, re-examining the kinds of technology that can be exported to China and restricting China's role in building America's next-generation telecommunications networks, while also discouraging other countries from using Chinese equipment.\n\nThe F.B.I. has increased its scrutiny of Chinese researchers in the United States over fears they may be acquiring intellectual secrets. A Justice Department initiative is targeting commercial espionage of American technology, and earlier this year the United States unveiled a sweeping indictment of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, over accusations of stealing trade secrets and evading American sanctions on Iran.\n\nChina, whose ambition is to dominate industries of the future, is pushing back. A column on Saturday in the Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper stated, \"The United States is again waving the club of tariffs after misjudging China's strength, capacity and will, further escalating trade friction between our two countries.\"\n\nThe piece was written under the pen name Zhong Sheng -- the \"voice of China\" -- a name used when the paper publishes comments on foreign affairs that are authoritative.\n\nRestraining China's ambitions and methods is a tricky task -- and there is concern that the Trump administration's effort is creating a new red scare, fueling discrimination against China and its citizens that could ultimately hurt the United States. As many as 30 Chinese professors have had their visas to the United States canceled in the past year, or been put on administrative review, according to Chinese academics and their American counterparts.\n\n\"We've got decades of painful negotiating with China ahead,\" said David Lampton, a China scholar at Stanford University. Mr. Lampton said a trade deal, if reached, would do little to resolve the bigger conflict. \"It's just a skirmish in an ongoing battle.\"\n\nChinese negotiators returned to Beijing over the weekend without a trade agreement and with even larger economic barriers between the two countries. The Trump administration raised tariffs on $200 billion in exports on Friday and said it would move ahead with the legal process of taxing another roughly $300 billion of products at the same 25 percent rate.\n\nThe two countries could yet come to an agreement that opens opportunities for businesses and rolls back the levies they have placed on each other. Both American and Chinese officials said on Friday that they would continue to talk and could meet in Beijing next month. Liu He, China's vice premier, called the failure to reach a deal \"just a small setback in the talks between two countries,\" while Mr. Trump, in a tweet, described the talks as \"candid and constructive.\"\n\nWhile a trade deal could calm some tensions and establish more good will between the two nations, it is unlikely to achieve many of the ambitious goals that the administration has set for itself. Mr. Trump's advisers, in particular the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, have been focused on what the administration calls China's practices of \"economic aggression.\"\n\nBut the administration has struggled to address the immensity of the problems in the text of a trade deal. People close to the talks say that the negotiators appear powerless to force any changes that aren't in China's interest.\n\nMr. Liu, who is leading China's team in the trade negotiations, hinted at that uphill battle in a video statement released by the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n\"Now both sides have reached consensus in many respects, but frankly there are also areas of disagreement,\" he said. \"We believe that these are major matters of principle, and any country has its own important principles -- we can't make concessions on matters of principle.\"\n\nDespite punishing tariffs already on nearly half of Chinese exports to the United States, Beijing is still resisting many of the most significant changes that the administration seeks. It has been reluctant to roll back subsidies for advanced manufacturing industries or to make public commitments to stop cybertheft.\n\nInstead, a trade deal between the two countries seems more likely to bring change around the margins -- tens of billions of dollars of soybean purchases, some tariffs lifted and changes to the text of Chinese laws or regulations that the country might ultimately disregard, particularly once another administration occupies the White House.\n\n\"This is a decades-long endeavor,\" said Robert Daly, the director of the Wilson Center's Kissinger Institute on China and the United States. \"This can't be waved away over cake at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nThe notion that the United States has one last shot to change China's behavior is held by an array of people on both sides of the political spectrum. But it is an aggressive notion of American power to upend a rival system that has delivered prosperity for its people and put China on course to be the world's largest economy.\n\nMany in China see the United States as a declining power bent on enforcing its will on a world that no longer cowers before its hegemonic might. The troubles in American democracy and the long economic slump after 2008 persuaded many in China that its instincts to chart its own course were correct. In the eyes of many Chinese, their country is simply reclaiming its historic status as a dominant regional power in Asia.\n\nIt has also projected power across Asia, Africa and elsewhere while the United States has, on many fronts, retreated from its post-World War II commitment to the global order. But it has done so with little application of military force, in sharp contrast to what many in China see as American militarism.\n\nMany in China have sought to avoid a trade conflict, which could have a larger impact on their economy than the United States'. But they have long thought the United States would have a difficult time accepting a true peer in economic, technology and military power, so consider the management of conflict with the United States to be an inevitable result of their own rise.\n\nWhile the Trump administration accused China of breaking a trade deal, China's resistance to the emerging terms stemmed from its belief that the United States was asking too much and offering too little in return. Many of the changes the United States seeks would limit what Chinese officials regard as a tried-and-true approach of using tens of billions of dollars from state-owned banks and government investment funds to turn previously small industries like car production or solar panel manufacturing into the largest industries of their kind in the world.\n\nAnd the Chinese view some of the Trump administration's demands as infringing on their sovereignty and giving America too much power over their economy -- including requiring the country to codify changes through legislation in the National People's Congress. To the increasingly nationalistic public in China, the American requests are reminiscent of 19th century history of unequal treaties forced on the country by foreign powers.\n\nMr. Trump on Saturday suggested China was simply delaying a deal in the hopes that a Democrat would win election in 2020 and continued his pugilistic approach, saying \"the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term. Would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting BIG TARIFFS!\"\n\nIn the United States, China's unwillingness to bow to America's demands is uniting lawmakers like the Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.\n\nThat is a significant shift from the prevailing view in the United States since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 that close economic engagement with China would produce an increasingly democratic country that would be closely tied to an international economic order founded mainly on Western liberal ideals.\n\nThat has not happened.\n\nChina has indeed grown in prosperity, leaping into the ranks of what the World Bank defines as upper-middle income countries. Its economy is now bigger than any other country except the United States. Its manufacturing sector is now bigger than those of the United States, Germany and South Korea combined.\n\nBut in the last five years, China has veered toward increasingly repressive authoritarianism at home and a rapid military buildup. The State Department estimates that Beijing has put 800,000 to two million Muslims in hastily built internment camps ringed with barbed wire in northwestern China. The Chinese government has built an archipelago of air bases on artificial islands in the South China Sea in between Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. And China now has the world's largest navy and has conducted military exercises as far away as East Africa and the Baltic Sea.\n\nOn the economic front, the competition is even fiercer. Trump administration officials warn that China is trying to dominate the global 5G infrastructure that will be the basis for future mobile communications and is competing to set other technological standards that will determine which global companies win.\n\nChina is extending low-cost loans and building infrastructure around the globe through its One Belt, One Road program, which critics warn is making poorer countries beholden to China. It is out-investing the United States in some high-tech industries, and is gaining dominance in certain segments, like mobile payment, new energy vehicles and areas of artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile American companies have long hankered for access to China's growing market, their position has begun to shift as they see China's practices and treatment of foreign companies. A survey released by the American Chamber of Commerce in China in February showed that the majority of its members favored retaining tariffs on Chinese goods while trade negotiations continued.\n\nChina's own experts say that the Beijing leadership has been caught off guard by the pace of change in American perceptions of Sino-American relations.\n\n\"Even if there is some kind of agreement between Xi and Trump, in the long run the strategic bilateral relationship is already in trouble,\" said Zhang Jian, a professor in the School of Government at Peking University. \"There is no coming back, even if there is a deal.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/12/us/12dc-tradewar-sub-2/merlin_153827598_526c0d28-e557-4511-a8da-a90f4aa0af0b-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800969", "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 296169600}, {"uri": "1141791843", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:20:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/business/us-china-tariffs.html", "title": "In China, Some Fear the End of 'Chimerica'", "body": "Wu Shichun is one of countless Chinese entrepreneurs who over the past four decades have prospered from access to American customers and money.\n\nToday, as the American government threatens to take that away, the serial entrepreneur and venture capital investor is fundamentally rethinking how he does business.\n\nOne of his portfolio companies designs and makes fashion products in China, then sells to American consumers on Amazon.com. Another, a vape device maker, sells most of its products in the United States. The third, which makes metal materials for electronic manufacturers, exports 40 percent of its production there. All three would be hit by new American tariffs.\n\n\"From now on I'll have to invest in companies that focus on the Chinese market,\" said Mr. Wu, 42.\n\n\"I hope China and the U.S. can find a better way to coexist,\" he said. \"It doesn't have to be mutually destructive.\"\n\nThe Chinese government has struck a defiant tone since President Trump ratcheted up the trade war on Friday by raising tariffs on Chinese exports worth $200 billion a year. \"If the U.S. wants to talk, our door is open,\" said a commentary on state-controlled China Central Television on Monday night that quickly went viral. \"If the U.S. wants to fight, we'll be with them till the end.\"\n\nMany entrepreneurs and intellectuals, by contrast, are hoping for a deal. China's rise out of the stark terror of the Cultural Revolution was fueled in part from connections to the United States, an early diplomatic partner that offered investment, markets and opportunity. There's even a word going around the Chinese internet for the tight economic bonds that have formed between the world's two largest economies: \"Chimerica.\"\n\nThe trade war is taking direct aim at Chimerica. New tariffs, if they stick, threaten to cut off a big market for many Chinese companies.\n\n[Trump's love for tariffs began in Japan's '80s boom.]\n\nBeyond tariffs, trade hawks within the Trump administration are pursuing what they call decoupling, or breaking up a relationship that they now feel poses a long-term strategic threat to the United States. The trade hawks hope to get American companies to shift their factories to friendlier countries. They are pushing to restrict Chinese investment in the United States and cut academic and other bonds.\n\nNow many people in China are wondering what will happen if the countries decouple. They question whether the country can continue its miraculous rise as borders and barriers go up.\n\n\"From the day we were born, my generation has always seen the country's economy heading for the better,\" Feng Dahui, an early Alibaba employee and an internet entrepreneur in the city of Hangzhou, wrote on his timeline on WeChat, the Chinese social media service, on Monday evening.\n\n\"We've experienced the internet revolution and enjoyed the benefits of globalization,\" he continued. \"Now this type of optimism seems to be deserting us. Everything seems to be ending abruptly.\"\n\nTheir concerns are unlikely to sway the Chinese government. Most political analysts believe that the only effective pressure will have to come from within the Chinese Communist Party's leadership, and official voices have been uniformly strident. Negative commentaries have been stricken from China's heavily censored internet.\n\nStill, some entrepreneurs are expressing their worries.\n\nXiao Yu said the e-commerce business he founded, OFashion, which sells luxury goods from Europe and the United States to Chinese consumers, saw growth slow in the second half of last year partly because of the trade war. While only about 10 percent of its merchandise comes from American brands like Michael Kors or Coach, the trade war has hit China's stock market and hurt consumer confidence.\n\nThe trade war could jeopardize his dreams of raising money from American investors and perhaps even taking his start-up public on an American stock exchange, he said.\n\n\"As an entrepreneur, our fate is tightly bound to the country,\" Mr. Xiao said. He hopes and is confident that the two countries can reach a deal.\n\n\"China and the U.S. don't have to have strained relations,\" he said.\n\nMany also appear worried that the trade war and the government's tightening control over the private sector could halt or even reverse its progress. In a country only a couple of generations removed from starvation, the possibility doesn't seem far-fetched to many. One 2017 post online, called \"A Guide to Eating Tree Bark,\" described how people in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia survived during the starvation of the Great Leap Forward. It has recently gone viral again, with more than 100,000 page views.\n\nThe two sides have plenty of reasons to distrust each other. The United States blames China for heavy job losses, theft of corporate secrets and cheating at the rules of global trade. China credits the hard work and sacrifices of its people for its success and sees the trade war as driven by American fears of a prosperous Chinese nation.\n\nBut the doves in China say both sides benefit from the relationship more than they admit. Foreign investors were early backers and inspirations for Chinese internet giants like Alibaba and Tencent, for example. And many American companies and investors have profited handsomely from China's rise.\n\nThose hoping for a deal worry that the Chinese government has fundamentally misjudged the Trump administration. At three top-level economic and monetary meetings in April, an economist at a Chinese investment bank said, government officials sent the signals that the leadership was optimistic about a trade deal.\n\nSome people are resurrecting old articles online about the Chinese-American relationship that are now going viral. One of them was a January speech by Li Ruogu, a former chairman of the Export-Import Bank of China and former deputy governor of China's central bank. Mr. Li argued that many Chinese, including some senior officials, didn't realize that the relations had shifted fundamentally. The conflict wasn't about the United States being threatened by China's growth, he said, but by its vision of state-led capitalism.\n\n\"This is the conflict of systems,\" he wrote. \"It won't end easily.\"\n\nAnother popular, and subsequently censored, article had the headline \"The Reasons Behind the Chimerica Breakup,\" recalling the portmanteau coined by Niall Ferguson and Moritz Schularick.

Such a move would have taken aim at Japan and Europe, big auto manufacturers, and likely disrupted trade talks that the Trump administration had just begun.\n\nThe decision reflects the administration's reassessment of pieces of its tariff strategy with allies around the world as it focuses on an all-encompassing trade war with China.\n\nOn Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also said that the United States was closing in on an agreement with Mexico and Canada to roll back tariffs on steel and aluminum, which were imposed last year. If the administration does, it would end a standoff that has heightened tensions among the three countries and complicated efforts to pass the new North American Free Trade Agreement into law.\n\n\"I think we're close to an understanding with Mexico and Canada,\" Mr. Mnuchin said at a Senate hearing Wednesday, although he added that he was not ready to say that the United States was lifting tariffs. \"I can assure you it is a priority of ours.\"\n\nAsked after the hearing about the prospect of a deal with China, Mr. Mnuchin was cautious.\n\n\"I'm hopeful,\" he said. \"I wouldn't say I'm confident.\"\n\nThe potential rollback of certain tariffs reflects the challenge of fighting trade wars on multiple fronts. Lawmakers and businesses are putting more pressure on the White House to concentrate their efforts on combating China's unfair trade practices, while reversing far more unpopular tariffs on allies like Europe, Canada and Mexico.\n\nYet the outcome for these tariffs is still uncertain. Mr. Trump has long been a devotee of tariffs, viewing them as an effective way to rebalance trading relationships. Political advisers and auto industry executives have emphasized that the president will make the final decision on whether to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on foreign cars.\n\nThe specter of auto tariffs has hung over relations with the European Union and Japan, both major suppliers of automobiles to the United States. Canada and Mexico have negotiated a quota with the United States as part of their trade agreement that would exempt them from the measure.\n\nThe president has frequently floated the idea of auto tariffs in the past, but two people familiar with the matter said that the White House had decided to delay a decision on the levies for six months, one of the president's options under current trade law.\n\nThe decision was due by Friday, but the tariffs have provoked fierce opposition among industry leaders and in Congress. In addition, the White House is now engaged in preliminary trade talks with the European Union and with Japan, and auto tariffs would throw a bomb into those negotiations.\n\n\"Pleased that @POTUS has delayed decision on auto tariffs,\" Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, tweeted Wednesday in response to media reports that the levies would not be imposed.\n\nAuto tariffs would have opened another front to Mr. Trump's trade war, but one with much smaller potential benefits and larger political liabilities. Auto industry executives on both sides of the Atlantic are opposed to tariffs, and the duties would have inflicted collateral damage on some of his most loyal voters in states like Alabama and South Carolina, which are home to big Mercedes-Benz and BMW factories.\n\n\"Our biggest market is Germany,\" said Jeppe Kofod, a member of the European Parliament from Denmark. \"The mere fact that Germany is hurt -- we would be very much affected by that.\"\n\nThe 25 percent tariff on steel and the 10 percent tariff on aluminum that the Trump administration imposed last year have had a more muted economic effect, but they have done much to rattle alliances.\n\nMexico and Canada, both of which retaliated with tariffs of their own, have previously appeared to be close to an agreement. But Mr. Trump has been hesitant to relent over his desire to protect America's steel and aluminum sectors and his belief that the tariffs might be used as further leverage.\n\nThe United States and Canada sent mixed signals Wednesday about the future of the steel and aluminum tariffs. The Canadian foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, declined to say whether the countries had struck a deal to lift those tariffs after meetings with lawmakers and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, in Washington on Wednesday.\n\nMs. Freeland said that her conversations had been \"productive\" and that the two sides had been in constant contact in recent weeks. But she suggested that it would be a mistake to predict how long negotiations would last.\n\n\"As has been the case from the outset, we believe that these tariffs need to be lifted,\" Ms. Freeland said.\n\nEven if the president rolls back metal levies on Canada and Mexico, the current level of tariffs in the United States would remain high. The levies that Mr. Trump has put in place have given the United States a tariff rate that is twice as high as the rates imposed by Canada, Britain, Italy, Germany and France. And the overall tariff would increase greatly should Mr. Trump choose to impose measures on foreign cars.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats in Congress have been sharply critical of the metal tariffs, warning that the new Nafta deal would not pass until they were removed.\n\nMs. Freeland said Wednesday that a failure to remove the tariffs could doom the deal in Canada.\n\n\"As long as the tariffs are in place, ratification will be very, very problematic,\" she said.\n\nThe United States has been trying to persuade Canada and Mexico to agree to a quota system for steel and aluminum in exchange for rolling back the tariffs. Canada and Mexico have pushed back.\n\nIt is unclear what terms the three countries are close to settling on. But Mexican officials have expressed optimism on the topic. A senior Mexican official said this week that recent talks about removing the tariffs had been \"fruitful.\"\n\nSenator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he had been pressing Mr. Trump to eliminate the metal tariffs completely.\n\n\"It's critical to the credibility of our global trade agenda,\" Mr. Grassley told reporters on Tuesday. \"I say the president needs to lift these tariffs.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/business/15DC-TRADE--1/15DC-TRADE--1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 296169600}, {"uri": "1141790166", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:17:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:17:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/upshot/us-china-trade-war.html", "title": "Why the U.S.-China Trade War Could Be Long and Painful: No Offramps", "body": "There's a shrinking supply of the 'constructive ambiguity' that would let each side present a deal as a win.\n\nJust two weeks ago, the United States and China seemed to be gliding toward a trade deal meant to resolve tensions between the world's two largest economies.\n\nBut the breakdown in talks since -- the United States raised tariffs to 25 percent on $200 billion of Chinese imports, for example, and is threatening to tax an additional $300 billion -- worries people who study international economic diplomacy.\n\nThat's because both the United States and China seem to be digging into their positions in ways that will be hard to resolve with the mutual face-saving that typically turns high-stakes negotiations into deals.\n\nTo use a common negotiating metaphor, it is not clear what the offramps might be that would allow a de-escalation and prevent a major trade war that would prove costly to both nations.\n\nIn effect, President Trump appears to view continuing tension with China as good for him politically and has said, contrary to the view of mainstream economists, that tariffs are a reason for the United States' recent economic good fortune.\n\nChina's leaders may not reveal their thinking in real time on Twitter, but they have signaled that many of the concessions the United States wants would require China to sacrifice core parts of its economic strategy and national sovereignty -- in particular its ambitions to lead in the high-tech industries of the future.\n\n\"Each side has dug itself into some fairly deep holes such that it will be difficult to emerge from,\" said Douglas Rediker, chairman of International Capital Strategies and a former U.S. representative to the International Monetary Fund. As is often the case in negotiations, the pathway to a deal may rest in a \"constructive ambiguity\" that both sides can present to their domestic audiences as a win.\n\n\"Do I believe there's enough room to find common ground?\" Mr. Rediker said. \"Yes, but only based on this ambiguity that doesn't necessarily resolve the issues in one party's favor or another.\"\n\nBoth sides have taken subtle steps to allow time for last-ditch efforts. China sent a senior negotiator to Washington last week despite the breakdown in talks, and it delayed the start of its retaliatory tariffs on American imports until June 1. The United States applied the newest wave of higher tariffs based on when ships containing the affected goods arrive, adding a few weeks in which a reversal could be hammered out.\n\nAnd President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China could meet at the G20 summit in late June in Osaka, Japan, which would be an opportunity for de-escalation at the highest levels.\n\nBut open lines of communication and time to work won't by themselves solve the problem of how to finesse some mutually agreeable deal, particularly given that both countries view this negotiation as resetting their economic relationship in ways that would have long-lasting consequences.\n\nAdd in Mr. Trump's tendency to view every negotiation through a zero-sum prism, and it may be hard to find a pathway for both parties to go home able to proclaim victory.\n\nWhen the negotiations seemed to be going well a few weeks ago, \"I thought we were going toward constructive ambiguity,\" said Mary E. Lovely, an economist and trade expert at Syracuse University's Maxwell School.\n\nThe United States is demanding that China codify rules into law to protect American companies (and their technology) that do business in China. Chinese negotiators now reject that possibility; American officials said they had agreed to those provisions.\n\n\"It looks like there was a level of specificity that China wasn't willing to accept and a level of ambiguity that the Trump administration wasn't willing to accept,\" Ms. Lovely said. \"It looks like the Chinese are firm that there are some areas where they are not willing to go, that they see as disrespectful.\"\n\nIf the escalation now being signaled by both sides goes into force, Americans will face higher prices for a wide range of goods, and certain American manufacturers will face less demand for their products. Already, American farmers are suffering amid reduced Chinese demand for soybeans and other products. The Chinese manufacturing sector is hurting as well -- and is likely to suffer further if tariffs reduce American demand for their products or drive relocation of production to other countries.\n\nUltimately the question becomes how much of that pain each side will be willing to endure, and whether the two nations' leaders feel a sense of urgency to each help the other save face domestically.\n\nThings can change quickly. In a different sphere, for example, Mr. Trump went from threatening North Korea with nuclear annihilation to acting as if they were old friends practically overnight.\n\nBut given where things stand, it may take that kind of surprising reset between two top leaders, built on personal relationships, rather than the slow grind of hammering out an agreement that is more typical of economic diplomacy.\n\n\"The off-ramps are tricky here because the president believes this is good policy, and the Chinese are loath to cave on it,\" said Jay Shambaugh, a professor of international economics at George Washington University and director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. \"It's not abundantly clear how you climb down without any damage.\"\n\nThe question for the weeks and months ahead is how much damage each side will tolerate before rethinking some of those basic assumptions and deciding that they don't want to dig in quite so hard, after all.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_irwin@nytimes.com", "name": "Neil Irwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/14/upshot/up-trade/up-trade-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 296169420}, {"uri": "1141790178", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:17:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:17:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4823529422283173, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/upshot/unemployment-inflation-changing-economic-fundamentals.html", "title": "The Economy That Wasn't Supposed to Happen: Booming Jobs, Low Inflation", "body": "Maybe using data from a few decades in the middle of the 20th century to set policy in the 21st isn't such a good idea.\n\nThe labor market the United States is experiencing right now wasn't supposed to be possible.\n\nNot that long ago, the overwhelming consensus among economists would have been that you couldn't have a 3.6 percent unemployment rate without also seeing the rate of job creation slowing (where are new workers going to come from with so few out of work, after all?) and having an inflation surge (a worker shortage should mean employers bidding up wages, right?).\n\nAnd yet that is what has happened, with the April employment numbers putting an exclamation point on the trend. The jobless rate receded to its lowest level in five decades. Employers also added 263,000 jobs; the job creation estimates of previous months were revised up; and average hourly earnings continued to rise at a steady rate -- up 3.2 percent over the last year.\n\nCompare that reality with the projections the Federal Reserve published just three years ago. In mid-2016, Fed officials thought that the long-run rate of unemployment would be around 4.8 percent, and that this would coincide with 2 percent inflation.\n\nIf that were the jobless rate today, 1.9 million Americans would not be working who are instead gainfully employed. And despite this ultralow unemployment rate, inflation is only 1.6 percent over the last year, below the level the Fed aims for.\n\nBecause this is 2019 and everything immediately devolves into partisan warfare, these good results are immediately seized upon by Trump partisans who view the good news as a result of the president's policies, and by opponents who give credit to the already-improving economy that President Obama handed over in January 2017.\n\nThere is truth in both. The job market had already been improving for years when President Trump took office, and its performance since then has been more continuation of the trend than an abrupt upturn.\n\nAfter more than two years of the Trump administration, warnings that trade wars and erratic management style would throw the economy off course have proved wrong so far, and tax cuts and deregulation are most likely part of the reason for the strong growth rates in 2018 and the beginning of 2019 (though most forecasts envision a slowing in the coming quarters as the impact of tax cuts fades).\n\nIn particular, it now appears that recession fears that emerged at the end of 2018 were misguided -- especially once the Fed backed off its campaign of rate increases at the start of 2019.\n\nBut beyond the assigning of credit or blame, there's a bigger lesson in the job market's remarkably strong performance: about the limits of knowledge when it comes to something as complex as the $20 trillion U.S. economy.\n\nThe last few years have made it clear that the Phillips curve -- the relationship between unemployment and inflation -- has either changed shape or become irrelevant.\n\nThe breakdown of the old guidelines suggests that policymakers need to avoid overreliance on them, and to stay broad-minded to the full range of economic possibilities. Maybe using data from a few decades in the middle of the 20th century to set policy in the 21st isn't actually a good idea.\n\nThe results of the last few years make you wonder whether we've been too pessimistic about just how hot the United States economy can run without inflation or other negative effects.\n\nThere are even early signs that the tight labor market may be contributing to, or at least coinciding with, a surge in worker productivity, which if sustained would fuel higher wages and living standards over time. That further supports the case for the Fed and other policymakers to let the expansion rip rather than trying to hold it back.\n\nIt's tough setting economic policy. To make decisions, you have to create a forecast, and there's a reason these forecasts tend to be based on historical experience.\n\nBut the last 20 years have been a wrenching period for the world economy, with all sorts of forces that have reshaped fundamentals: globalization, demographic shifts, technological changes and much more.\n\nThe continued boom in the American job market suggests that economic policymakers need to be open-minded about when the old relationships and rules of thumb no longer apply.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_irwin@nytimes.com", "name": "Neil Irwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/02/upshot/up-jobs/up-jobs-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800233", "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 296169420}, {"uri": "1141790177", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:17:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:17:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5137255191802979, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/upshot/trade-war-stock-market-china-us-tariff.html", "title": "Why Markets Aren't Sweating the U.S.-China Trade War Much: The 'Trump Put'", "body": "The president has tended to back off whenever markets and the economy have looked soft.\n\nThe real question is not why the stock market is down this week. It is why it is down so little.\n\nAfter all, the world's two largest economies have seemed to be hurtling toward a major escalation of their trade war. American officials have complained that Chinese negotiators have been playing a bait-and-switch, backing away from concessions they had agreed to.\n\nPresident Trump said the United States would raise its tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent on Friday, and begin taxing the remaining $325 billion of goods at that rate \"shortly.\" For a while, it was unclear whether negotiations would resume at all this week.\n\n[President Trump taunted China by tweet on Wednesday.]\n\nIf trade talks did disintegrate, even with the arrival of high-level Chinese officials in Washington, the economy would be in danger of experiencing a meaningful downturn and potentially a recession. Economists at Moody's Analytics, for example, expect it would subtract 1.8 percentage points from G.D.P. growth and cause unemployment to rise.\n\nIt would particularly hammer the financial results of some of the prominent American companies that either import Chinese goods or rely on the country as a major export market.\n\nYet the S&P 500 was down only 2.2 percent in the first three trading days of the week. The index has given up only about a month's worth of gains; markets were lower as recently as early April.\n\nThe answer to the puzzle lies in a few words: the Trump Put.\n\nA \"put\" is a type of option security that lets people put a floor under their losses. If you buy stock for $50 a share and also a put with a $40 strike price, you are protected from losing more than $10 per share.\n\nIn his 28 months in office, Mr. Trump has created a sense in markets that he will play that role for the economy as a whole. His administration has followed through on some of his threats -- applying tariffs on many steel and aluminum imports, the existing tariffs on Chinese imports that Mr. Trump threatened to expand on Sunday -- but has backed off whenever markets and the economy have looked soft.\n\nA prime example came late last year, with financial markets falling and the risk of recession rising. The emergence of constructive negotiations between American and Chinese officials -- in particular after a Feb. 22 Oval Office meeting -- was one factor in a rally that has driven stocks up 15 percent so far in 2019. The Federal Reserve's decision to back off plans for interest rate increases, as well as successful Chinese efforts to stimulate its economy, were other major factors.\n\nIf you're trying to bet on where markets will be six months or a year from now, there are a few things you know. The president of the United States cares a lot about what happens to the stock market, as his tweets make plain. He will be running for re-election in 18 months. He enjoys making big, bold promises, many of which don't materialize.\n\nThat adds up to a conviction that nothing really bad will happen -- that the administration will strike some kind of deal, even if it does little to address long-term economic tensions between the United States and China.\n\nThe only problem is that the existence of the Trump Put creates a funny circular system.\n\nPresident Trump is more confident in taking an aggressive negotiating stand because the stock market is up a lot this year and the American economy is looking solid. The perception of a Trump Put means that markets don't fall very much even with that tougher negotiating stand. But that, in turn, means a weaker signal to the president and his inner circle that there would be negative consequences if they followed through with the president's Twitter threats to place tariffs on all Chinese imports.\n\nWith China's vice premier, Liu He, set to come to Washington for two days of talks, there is plenty of incentive for both sides to reach a deal.\n\nBut the existence of the Trump Put seems to increase the odds of a miscalculation. The danger would be greater if the relatively muted market response to the threats of escalation caused Trump administration negotiators to believe his line that the United States economy was doing well because of tariffs (as Mr. Trump has tweeted) and not despite them (as almost all mainstream economists believe).\n\nIf that miscalculation happens and the Trump Put turns out to be less reliable than it appeared, we will most likely find ourselves in a more damaging sort of global trade war than anything we've seen up to this point.\n\nAnd that, in turn, could make the turbulence in markets this week seem downright quaint.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_irwin@nytimes.com", "name": "Neil Irwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/08/upshot/08up-markets/08up-markets-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800969", "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 296169420}, {"uri": "1141717839", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "19:16:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T19:16:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4745098054409027, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/business/economy/trump-fed-judy-shelton.html", "title": "Trump Team Vets Fed Critic for Board Seat", "body": "The Trump administration is vetting Judy Shelton, a conservative economist and former Trump campaign adviser, for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board, according to people familiar with the matter, putting the longtime Fed critic one step closer to a leadership role at an institution she would like to drastically change.\n\nMs. Shelton, 64, was recently interviewed by Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, but has yet to meet with President Trump.\n\nIf nominated and confirmed, Ms. Shelton would take one of two open positions on the seven-member board of governors in Washington. Two of Mr. Trump's would-be nominees, Herman Cain and Stephen Moore, were withdrawn from consideration after Republican lawmakers made clear they would not support their nominations given concerns about their past treatment of, or statements about, women.\n\nMs. Shelton, now executive director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, previously advised Mr. Trump during his presidential campaign and served on his transition team. She has regularly praised Mr. Trump's economic policies, and now favors near-zero interest rates, a position likely to curry favor with a president who has called the central bank the \"biggest risk\" to the economy.\n\nIn an interview, Ms. Shelton criticized the Fed's current practice of paying interest on excess money that banks keep at the Fed as a way to set the Fed's policy rate. The approach, she said, encourages banks to hold money that they would otherwise lend out, since they are being paid to keep their money idle. To help \"phase out\" the practice, Ms. Shelton said, she would support gradually cutting interest rates back to rock-bottom. If that spurred inflation, Ms. Shelton said, she would want to sell off the Fed's holdings of Treasury securities and other government-backed bonds to keep prices from spiraling out of control.\n\n\"It's like paying the banks to do nothing,\" Ms. Shelton said of the current practice. Her plan would be \"effectively cutting interest rates, but not as a primary goal.\"\n\nMs. Shelton, who is friends with both Mr. Kudlow and Mr. Moore, has been a proponent of the White House's $1.5 trillion tax cut, deregulatory approach, and continuing trade war with China, which she calls \"uncomfortable\" but something \"we have to pursue.\"\n\n\"The policy changes, I think, are unleashing the potential for a high-growth, productive economy,'' she said.\n\nMs. Shelton could have an easier road to nomination than some of Mr. Trump's more recent picks. She was confirmed in March 2018 as head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, so she has already passed a government background check and made it through Senate Foreign Relations Committee vetting. If she is nominated, the Senate Banking Committee will hold her Fed confirmation hearing.\n\nStill, while four of Mr. Trump's Fed nominees were confirmed, his two most recent formal nominations -- Nellie Liang and Marvin Goodfriend -- were never cleared by lawmakers. And neither Mr. Moore, a political commentator, nor Mr. Cain, a former presidential candidate, was ever formally nominated after concerns about past issues surfaced.\n\nMs. Shelton would be an unconventional pick for the Federal Reserve's board of governors. Her preference for a linked currency -- one tied to gold or some other reference point, rather than simply backed by faith in the government -- would make her unique among her colleagues. She wrote in 2018 that \"we make America great again by making America's money great again.\"\n\nThat stance may appeal to Mr. Trump, who has fondly recalled the gold standard.\n\nShe has also been an outspoken opponent of the Fed, criticizing the central bank's policies as a driver of the 2008 financial crisis and its attempt to clean up the mess. \"No other government institution had more influence over the creation of money and credit in the lead-up to the devastating 2008 global meltdown,\" she wrote in The Wall Street Journal in April. \"And the Fed's response to the meltdown may have exacerbated the damage by lowering the incentive for banks to fund private-sector growth.\"\n\n\"She would bring a different voice, a different perspective,'' said James A. Dorn, vice president for monetary studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. \"Judy has been much more critical of the Fed than most of the people who are currently on the board.\"\n\nMs. Shelton holds a doctorate in business administration from the University of Utah and cut her teeth at the Hoover Institution from 1985 to 1995. She sat just down the hall from Milton Friedman, a conservative economist who developed important groundwork for modern monetary policy. Condoleezza Rice, who went on to be secretary of state under President George W. Bush, was another colleague.\n\nShe then made her way to Washington. She worked with Bob Dole's presidential campaign back in 1996. She spent much of the 2000s writing opinion pieces, serving on corporate boards and working with the National Endowment for Democracy, most recently as chairwoman.\n\nShe began the 2016 election cycle advising Ben Carson, but began advising Mr. Trump's campaign in August 2016, after she penned a Wall Street Journal opinion piece titled \"Trump's Contribution to Sound Money.\" Steven Mnuchin, now the Treasury secretary, called and asked her to join the cause, she said. She went on to work on the Trump transition team in a Treasury role.\n\nMs. Shelton has been married to Gilbert Shelton, a former banker and investor, for more than 40 years. Both she and her husband regularly donate to right-leaning candidates and organizations, records show.\n\nSince taking her post at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a multilateral institution founded in 1991 to help foster post-Cold War projects in Central and Eastern Europe, Ms. Shelton has continued to watch and praise Mr. Trump's actions. She has also remained critical of the Fed, both in her writings and in a recent interview.\n\n\"It's fair to challenge the models and practices of the Federal Reserve, and to say, 'Is this is the best we could do?'\" Ms. Shelton said. \"Central banks, to some extent, have been a demoralizing force for free markets.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeanna_smialek@nytimes.com", "name": "Jeanna Smialek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/21/business/21DC-FEDNOM-01/21DC-FEDNOM-01-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4801004", "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 296162160}, {"uri": "1138803347", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-17", "time": "20:04:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-17T20:04:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/podcasts/daily-newsletter-podcast-hosts-rashida-tlaib.html", "title": "Interviewing the Interviewer", "body": "[Want to get this by email?

Can I ask you questions or no?\n\nMichael Barbaro: Not really. Who were you an assistant to?\n\nNatalie: I was an assistant to Nick Kristof and Charles Blow.\n\nMichael: Oh, wow. I had no idea. So you spent time in our Opinion department with the columnists.\n\nNatalie: I did. I was mainly a fact-checker.\n\nMichael: What's your favorite story of checking facts for Nick and Charles?\n\nNatalie: Honestly, the most hilarious moments did not involve fact-checking. They involved being Nick Kristof's travel planner. I had to file expenses for him.\n\nMichael: That man travels. And travels.\n\nNatalie: He would go places and bring back, like, a receipt on a piece of bark. It was hard to file. Then I would need to interface with all these governments that he had recently insulted in a column, to try to get him a visa.\n\nMichael: As in, hi, it's Natalie. I know you are really mad at Nick, but he'd like your permission to enter your country.\n\nNatalie: Exactly. He just called out your dictatorship, but, um, he's on his way!\n\nMichael: So you learn the art of persuasion.\n\nNatalie: Yes. And diplomacy. Also truly learned that if you are straightforward and honest with people, they will respect you.\n\nMichael: Wise words.\n\nNatalie: Even if they don't necessarily adore hearing from you.\n\nMichael: So that naturally leads you to want to report yourself?\n\nNatalie: Yeah, exactly. I caught the bug. Fact-checking is grueling work, but it is also the core of what we do. I liked the precision of it.\n\nMichael: I very much remember your first \"Daily\" episode, a really eye-opening investigation into pregnancy discrimination, because we all decided immediately that we wanted you back on ASAP, which is what happened.\n\nNatalie: Oh, that's nice.\n\nMichael: And now, from guest ... to guest host. How are you feeling about that?\n\nNatalie: Oof. It's not as easy as impersonating Michael in my living room?\n\nMichael: Hah.\n\nNatalie: No, but seriously, it isn't easy. One of the things about newspaper reporting that I always try to remember is that there is this imbalance built into it -- the things I say don't generally end up in an article, whereas the things people say to me do. But then, on \"The Daily,\" you, as the reporter, are right there in it. Every gasp, every giggle, every ... hmmmm.\n\nMichael: Hmmm. Do you think there are advantages to that? Having a reporter (you) be so present in the conversation?\n\nNatalie: The really nice thing is that there are these moments in reporting that never, ever make it into the newspaper -- moments of levity in a tough call, little tangents that would never make it into the lead of a news story, but are just so deeply a part of what we do. It's nice to feel like we can show people that we are humans, just talking to other humans, trying to figure things out.\n\nMichael: Entirely. There's also just the transparency of hearing both sides of a conversation. Not just one side.\n\nNatalie: Yes! I think that is really important, especially now. With the whole fake news meme.\n\nMichael: What's been the most fun about it?\n\nNatalie: The most fun -- being in the studio with the producers or with you, hearing something incredible in the middle of an interview, and looking up at the producers and making eye contact and just being like, YES! That's amazing!\n\nMichael: Give me an example.\n\nNatalie: Oh, well, when we were talking with Eldon, there was a moment in the middle of the interview where he brought up something that we hadn't really thought about in planning the interview. He pipes up with this smart, thoughtful description of what he's worried about. It was more than just the immediate questions of survival -- will the trade war kill his farm? -- but something much bigger and more diffuse. Will the trade war cause long-term damage to the trading relationships that the U.S. agriculture industry has built up over decades? I looked up at Paige, one of the producers, in that moment, and just shook my head, truly in wonder. Like, wow, this man needs a podcast!\n\nMichael: The Eldon Show. He's one of those guests we end up talking about for years. Like, remember Eldon? Why don't we just call back Eldon and make that an episode?\n\nNatalie: I get that.\n\nMichael: O.K., so, I have to run into a script planning session. But I want to leave with a final question and a thought. You possess this rare combination of intelligence, kindness, authority and wittiness. We like you. Will you agree to host more episodes?\n\nNatalie: Hmmm. Just kidding. Obviously, yes. Please. Whenever. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nMichael: Wonderful! We'll be in touch.\n\nNatalie: I'm just nervous the world will resist a Barbaro-free episode. Anyway, we can talk about that neurosis later. Byeee!!!\n\nMichael: They crave something new.\n\nTalk to Natalie on Twitter: @nataliekitro. And Michael: @mikiebarb.\n\nAbout that ending\n\nMany of you wondered why we ended Tuesday's episode about Representative Rashida Tlaib with a quote from President Trump that condemned her statements about the Holocaust and claimed she dislikes Jewish people. Why did we give him the last word? Several factors went into that decision:\n\n1. The president's quote appeared in what we call the \"back announce,\" the final words Michael reads in a segment that update you on what's happened since we recorded an interview. Back announces are, by design, almost always chronological. Events are laid out in the order they happened. In this case, the president's tweet was sent a day after Tlaib decried her critics for \"twisting and turning my words.\" It was the last development.\n\n2. We believed that Tlaib's claim that her words were being taken out of context, juxtaposed with a scolding presidential tweet that offered no context whatsoever, was revealing.\n\n3. Donald Trump is the president. His words and opinions matter. In an episode in which we devoted 30 minutes to having Tlaib tell her story and frame her views, we felt comfortable including the words of one of her most vocal critics: the president of the United States.\n\nWhat we're listening to\n\nWho: Marc Georges, an editor for \"The Daily\"\n\nWhat: \"Nerdette Recaps Game of Thrones with Peter Sagal\"\n\nThe cultural colossus that is \"Game of Thrones\" will come to an end this weekend. After eight years of political intrigue, zombie fights and dragon fire, we'll finally learn who will sit on the Iron Throne -- for now, at least. I've been watching the show since the beginning and have been rabidly seeking all the extra G.o.T. content I can find.\n\nOne of my favorite podcasts that covers the series is \"Nerdette Recaps Game of Thrones with Peter Sagal.\" Yes, that Peter Sagal, from NPR's \"Wait Wait ... Don't Tell Me!\" Hosts Greta Johnsen and Tricia Bobeda, along with Peter, have great chemistry on the mic, and the best thing about their podcast is that it doesn't turn into a love fest for G.o.T. The trio take the TV show seriously, and they honestly critique what worked and what didn't. It's a fun hang, and every week I find myself both laughing and nodding along to the crew.\n\nOn \"The Daily\" this week\n\nIran is back on a \"collision course\" with the U.S., and that may be part of national security adviser John Bolton's plan. Mark Landler explains.\n\n\"Look how I turned out. I turned out pretty tough.\" Representative Rashida Tlaib, who's at the center of a new political storm over her comments about Israel, tells us how her upbringing in an immigrant Palestinian family helped shape her political outlook.\n\nIn the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, much more is at stake than tariffs. \"For significant numbers of people, national pride and dignity is on the line,\" Peter Goodman says.\n\nWe talked to a farmer in Illinois and a truck manufacturer in Iowa, both supporters of President Trump, who've found themselves caught in the middle of the trade war.\n\nAlabama passed a law banning nearly all abortions.

On Monday, China retaliated with tariffs of its own. The trade war is now full-on -- except that it's not really about trade.\n\nChina does account for the largest share of America's trade deficit. But many experts don't seem to think that bilateral trade deficits are a problem in themselves -- they're just a symptom of other issues (if even that). \"The overall United States global trade imbalance is the result of economic conditions in the United States -- the excess of investment over savings,\" Martin Feldstein, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has argued, adding that if America's trade imbalance with China were eliminated, it would simply shift to other countries.\n\nWhether President Trump is misguided in doggedly pursuing tariffs or playing coy and using them as leverage with the Chinese government, America's continued drive to levy penalties is less about fixing a trade problem than about changing China's investment rules. In particular, the Trump administration perceives those rules as forcing the transfer of foreign technology to Chinese companies, unfairly helping them.\n\nBut even American negotiators who parse the trade versus tech issue this clearly tend to overlook an essential fact: The international trade and financial system that was set up after World War II -- with the creation of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and, much later, the World Trade Organization (all nurtured and dominated by the United States) -- actively encouraged \"technological spillovers\" from developed economies to developing ones. Under the W.T.O.'s agreements on intellectual property, developed countries are under \"the obligation\" to provide incentives to their companies to transfer technology to less developed countries.\n\nSuch transfers were seen to be in the West's interest, too: Far better that poor countries achieve self-sustaining growth than be dependent on foreign aid, the thinking went. But China did much better than achieve self-sustaining growth.\n\nBy the late 2000s, it had come to seem too successful, and a threat: The West was struggling then with a major financial crisis (largely of its own doing). Today, the longstanding principle that knowledge transfers are good all-around is being questioned. Do they continue to serve the global interest and should they still be encouraged -- even when it comes to China? Or should China be treated as an exception? It is in a class of its own, by dint of both its size and the state's involvement in its economy.\n\nAmerican negotiators have long complained that China's foreign investment practices are unfair. A report of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, published in 2013 and often cited since, estimated that China accounted for 50 to 80 percent of all international intellectual property theft. In its 2018 report, the Office of the United States Trade Representative accused China of using joint ventures to funnel technology to Chinese companies and of failing to protect foreign companies' intellectual property rights.\n\nBut the reality is more complex.\n\nYes, American companies have been granted access to some 35 restricted sectors in China -- like auto production, oil exploration, nuclear power, telecommunications, banks and medical institutions -- only on the condition that they transfer know-how to local partners. Chinese companies are developing electric vehicles with support from Renault-Nissan and Ford. Amazon and Microsoft are being asked to partner -- and share technology -- with Chinese companies before they can sell cloud-computing services in China.\n\nAnd yes, DuPont and General Motors have sued their Chinese joint-venture partners for misappropriating trade secrets. Outright theft also has sometimes occurred, including in the defense sector, of information about bombers and missile systems.\n\nBut to say all these things in the same breath is to risk conflating inadequate rules with violations of existing rules that may be adequate, and government policy with the behavior of private actors. Officials in the Trump administration suggest that China's foreign-investment requirements themselves amount to theft. In many instances, however, technology is being transferred between companies in the context of consensual, negotiated business agreements.\n\nAlso, violations or near-violations are par for the course during certain stages of a country's development. That fact doesn't make them acceptable, but it offers useful context for thinking through how best to react to them. Other rapidly growing economies, including Japan and South Korea in the 1980s, were also accused of unfairly securing technology from foreign partners (or subsidizing their exports). But as those countries' incomes rose and their own capacity to innovate developed, they started complying with the rules -- typically when per capita income reached $25,000.\n\nChina, at its current growth rates, is more than a decade away from achieving that income level. And yet it has already made more progress than is usually acknowledged toward protecting intellectual property rights. AmCham China's 2019 China Business Climate Survey Report noted that 59 percent of the more than 300 American companies it interviewed said that China's enforcement of intellectual property rights had improved over the last five years; 37 percent said it had stayed the same. (China is growing up in other respects, too. Both the I.M.F. and the United States Treasury have recently determined that the Chinese government is not manipulating its currency. And its current account surpluses have virtually evaporated.)\n\nThat said, penalties for, say, infringing patents remain weak in China and enforcement is lax. The National People's Congress passed a foreign-investment law in March, but it offered too little on implementation. In fact, the United States's latest tariffs were prompted by its perception that the Chinese government was backtracking on its commitment to incorporate into Chinese law major terms of the two countries' draft agreement to end the trade war.\n\nThe fundamental question, therefore, is this: Are China's current technology-transfer policies fair, given both past international practice and the country's extraordinary development? Or, to put the point more provocatively, did China's growth break the international economic order?\n\nRelatedMore from Opinion on China's economy.Opinion | Yi-Zheng LianXi Jinping Wanted Global Dominance. He Overshot.May 7, 2019Opinion | Yukon HuangThe Unlikely, Obvious Solution to the Trade WarSept. 24, 2018Opinion | Yukon HuangChina's Economy Is Not Normal. It Doesn't Have to Be.March 13, 2018\n\nThe answer partly depends on the existence, or not, of globally accepted guidelines. Just last year, in its World Economic Outlook report, the I.M.F. again highlighted the vital role that the diffusion of technology worldwide has played in driving growth globally. And China now accounts for almost one-third of global growth every year, according to Bloomberg.\n\nA more innovative China also doesn't mean a less competitive America. For one thing, as the Harvard economist Robert Lawrence has pointed out, developed countries and developing ones generally do not compete in the same product lines. The economist Zhang Jun and others have also argued that much of China's technological capacities are overstated anyway. Many of the more sophisticated components used in products that China exports to the West (think iPhones) are made elsewhere and merely assembled in China.\n\nCurbs on America's exports of \"emerging and foundational technologies\" -- notably to do with artificial intelligence or fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications networks -- will curtail knowledge flows to China. But they will also damage America's capacity for innovation, American tech experts have argued. (Likewise, Mr. Trump's decision this week to ban, on security grounds, foreign tech equipment in American telecommunications systems could hurt American companies.)\n\nTechnology transfers from the most developed states to less developed ones remain beneficial all-around, including for the most developed states -- even if the unique features of China's remarkable growth require adapting existing norms and regulatory mechanisms to better manage those transfers.\n\nThe Trump administration, which instinctively recoils at multilateral initiatives, is unlikely to want to turn to the W.T.O. or the World Bank. (It should, though, not least because the United States has usually fared well by W.T.O. rulings.) The next best opportunity to at least broach these issues will be during the Group of 20 summit meeting in Osaka, Japan, in June. China's growth may seem like a challenge to the world's economic order, but it is other states' reactions to it that could threaten the system.\n\nYukon Huang is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author of \"Cracking the China Conundrum: Why Conventional Economic Wisdom Is Wrong.\"\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

In Washington, on Wall Street and in corporate boardrooms, Beijing has used the country's size and promise for decades to quell opposition and reward those who helped its rise.\n\nThose days may be coming to an end.\n\nAs it struggles with President Trump's trade war, a maturing and debt-laden China is discovering that it no longer has the same pull. Members of both political parties in the United States favor a tougher stance against Beijing. Some old business allies are standing on the sidelines or even cheering the Trump administration's strong stands.\n\nChina could still prevail on the trade war's major issues. But the conflict's length and severity reflect the growing perception that the country no longer holds the promise that once enthralled politicians and businesses in the United States.\n\nMany American companies with large, profitable businesses in China do not want to pay expensive tariffs and worry that the United States is antagonizing the Chinese public, said Ker Gibbs, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. But many of the same businesses also chafe at the numerous restrictions that China has long maintained on foreign companies.\n\n\"We're looking at their expanding into global markets, and saying, 'Wait a minute, why can't we do that here?'\" Mr. Gibbs said.\n\nChina's economic slowdown, which could hinder growth globally, is a major reason its influence has ebbed. But there are other factors. The country's heavy debts, built up over years of lending used to spur growth, limit its options. If it retaliates against the United States sharply by devaluing its currency or shutting factories crucial to global supply chains, the moves could ricochet and hurt its own newfound wealth.\n\nForeign businesses have found it less appealing to make or sell their products in China over the last several years because of heavy restrictions on foreign businesses, stronger local competitors and rising costs. Mr. Trump's tariffs last year gave many businesses a final reason to look elsewhere.\n\nCall it the ABC supply chain, as in \"anywhere but China.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Kelly A. Kramer, the chief financial officer of Cisco, the big telecom equipment supplier, told investors that the company had \"greatly, greatly reduced\" its exposure to China because of the tariffs.\n\nMorey, a company near Chicago that makes rugged electronics for bulldozers and other outdoor equipment, reluctantly paid more for printed circuit boards made in China after Mr. Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion a year in Chinese imports last fall.\n\nWith those tariffs now rising to 25 percent, Morey executives have begun talking to suppliers in Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore.\n\n\"I was thinking this is a short-term issue that will go away,\" said George Whittier, the company's president and chief operating officer, \"and I don't think you can rationally think that any more.\"\n\nChina holds a lot of cards. It remains a huge profit source for Apple, Boeing, General Motors, Starbucks and other major corporations. It can use its substantial financial firepower and the government's control over crucial economic levers to endure a protracted trade conflict, while state-run media outlets help stem discontent at home.\n\nChinese officials and experts say the country can stand firm against Western pressure. Even some advocates of more market-oriented policies say Beijing should just make its own decisions now instead of tying them to a trade pact with Washington.\n\n\"China should focus on its own reform, which will eventually solve some current trade war contentious issues,\" said Zhu Ning, a Tsinghua University economist.\n\nStill, China has lost some of the swagger and appeal that once opened so many doors in Washington and on Wall Street.\n\nChina has long used its tremendous size and growth potential as both carrot and stick. Companies that played by its rules could gain access to a market of more than one billion people who were becoming increasingly affluent and eager to spend. Companies that complained could be left out.\n\nIt worked. G.M. and other companies caved in to demands like being forced to take on local joint venture partners, knowing that they were training future competitors. General Electric sold one complete diesel locomotive from Erie, Pa., to China, then taught the Chinese to build their own. Apple censors its App Store in China. When Google protested censorship and hacking, it was mostly kicked out.\n\nBusinesses then helped make China's case in Washington. When China wanted to join the World Trade Organization, the global trade club, it enlisted Wall Street's help. Businesses helped persuade successive American presidents to refrain from punishing China for manipulating its currency, even as Beijing manipulated its currency. They fought efforts to raise tariffs.\n\nChina remains vital to many businesses, but the dynamic has shifted. It still grows at a pace that developed countries envy. But its economy has slowed significantly from rates that as recently as 2010 topped 10 percent a year. Since Xi Jinping took power in 2012, the government has taken a stronger hand in business, requiring foreign companies to forge ties with the Communist Party and demanding access to data.\n\nBeijing has fewer ways to strike back against the United States now. Its tremendous success in nurturing its own homegrown industries, which has helped China's economy rise up the value chain, has reduced its imports of American goods, giving it fewer items to hit with tariffs.\n\nA decade ago, China bought Jeeps made in Michigan by Chrysler, bulldozers and other construction equipment made in Illinois by Caterpillar and huge diesel engines made in Indiana by Cummins. Now Chrysler makes Jeeps in Changsha and Guangzhou. Caterpillar makes construction equipment in Xuzhou. And Cummins builds engines at factories in Beijing, Chongqing, Hefei, Liuzhou, Xi'an and Xiangyang.\n\n\"China has been so effective at squeezing manufactured imports out of its market that it has really limited its options to retaliate,\" said Brad Setser, a Treasury official in the Obama administration who is now an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nChina's imports from the United States now fall mostly into four big categories: Boeing aircraft from Washington State; semiconductors, mainly from Intel factories in Oregon; farm products and energy from the Great Plains and Texas; and German-brand sport utility vehicles from South Carolina and Alabama. Although China could still shake the American political system if any harsh retaliation hurt economic growth in the United States, it has fewer opportunities to target electoral swing states and hurt Mr. Trump's chances of re-election next year.\n\nSlapping tariffs on those industries could also have big drawbacks. China needs those chips for its technology upgrades. Targeting Boeing planes would shift more Chinese business to Airbus, giving the European aircraft maker more leverage in negotiations with Beijing. On agriculture, China still does not grow enough soybeans to meet its needs, so higher tariffs on American crops might simply mean higher food prices down the line.\n\nChina has also shown surprising vulnerabilities, like its dependence on American semiconductor technology and software. Last year, when the United States briefly prohibited American companies from selling technology to the Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE for violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea, ZTE ground to a halt.\n\n\"The trade friction has also been a cold shower that has made us see our structural shortcomings more clearly,\" said a front-page commentary in People's Daily on Monday that bore a pen name used to signal authoritative positions on international relations.\n\nChina has options besides tariffs, but they have disadvantages as well.\n\nIt could sell a large chunk of the $1.3 trillion in United States Treasury debt that it holds. That could temporarily push up American interest rates. But it would saddle China with large losses. Beijing would have to find someplace else to park the money. Its previous sales, undertaken mainly to shore up the country's currency in 2015 and early 2016, did not affect the bond market much.\n\nAnother option would be for China to let its currency slide in value against the dollar, making its goods cheaper abroad and offsetting American tariffs. Doing that could prompt the Trump administration to raise its tariffs even higher. It might also tempt other countries to devalue their currencies, setting off a potentially costly currency war. And a Chinese devaluation could cause Chinese families and households to send their own savings out of the country.\n\nChina could crack down on American-owned factories in China or on those crucial to the supply chains of American companies. But that could lead still more multinational companies to consider leaving the country.\n\nThe dilemma for China is that the longer the trade war lasts, the more companies may decide to invest elsewhere. For now, domestic politics seem more important in China, with the leadership and the general public reacting angrily to what is portrayed in the country as peremptory American demands.\n\n\"We have the confidence and ability to withstand any external risks and impact,\" Geng Shuang, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said on Thursday.\n\nChris Buckley contributed reporting.

She and the company deny the charges.\n\nWhile Canada says China has made no specific link between the detentions of the two men and Meng's arrest, experts and former diplomats say they have no doubt it is using their cases to pressure Canada.\n\nECONOMIC FALLOUT\n\nThe Commerce Department said on Wednesday it was adding Huawei and affiliates to its \"Entity List,\" which bars them from buying components and technology from U.S. firms without government approval.\n\nLawmakers in the U.S. Congress have long feared that Huawei's equipment could be used by the Chinese government to spy on Americans. Democrats and Republicans lined up in support of the Trump administration's move.\n\nRepublican Senator Marco Rubio said firms should reconsider entering into long-term contracts with Huawei, noting in a tweet that \"very soon Huawei will lose access to important components like chips, antennae & phone operating systems.\"\n\nRubio added that for Huawei there are \"real questions now about how they can survive this.\"\n\nLeading analysts downgraded their assessments for several microchip companies in the wake of the move against Huawei, which was the world's third largest purchaser of semiconductors last year.\n\nHuawei was the world's third largest purchaser of semiconductors last year, accounting for 4.4% of global market share and behind only Samsung Electronics and Apple, according to Gartner, a research firm.\n\nSusquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said he believed Huawei had built up a one- to two-year supply of U.S. components, noting that \"this is what Huawei was afraid of!\" Rolland cut price targets on several microchip companies, including Xilinx Inc.\n\nShares of Xilinx were down 5.7 percent in the early afternoon on Thursday while those of rival chipmaker Qualcomm Inc fell 3.6 percent.

But at What Cost?", "body": "SYDNEY, Australia -- In a recent online discussion, Bill Shorten, the front-runner in the race to be Australia's next prime minister, left little doubt about where he stood on the politically delicate issue of relations with China -- and where the world's other superpower fit into his calculus.\n\n\"If I'm P.M., I welcome the rise of China in the world,\" he said in a post on the Chinese social media platform WeChat that was aimed at Australia's 1.2 million voters of Chinese descent. Mr. Shorten, the leader of the center-left Labor Party, added that he saw China not as a \"strategic threat,\" but as a \"strategic opportunity.\"\n\nThose words put him directly at odds with the Trump administration, which has sounded alarms about China's global ambitions and tactics. But Mr. Shorten, while acknowledging that Australia would always be an ally of the United States, declared that it was time for his nation \"to stand on its own feet and think for itself.\"\n\nIf Mr. Shorten's party prevails in Saturday's election, his embrace of China would represent a significant break from the current conservative Australian government, which has taken a harder line toward Beijing's growing influence in the country and whose leader, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, is an avowed admirer of President Trump. It could also signify a crack in the united front that the Trump administration is trying to build to check China's ascent.\n\nFor Mr. Shorten, the calculation may be largely about economics. The Labor leader, whose campaign has promised significant spending to bolster public health programs, education and wages, is hoping that improved relations with China, Australia's biggest trading partner, will keep the economy growing.\n\nMr. Morrison, whose conservative coalition has narrowed the gap with Mr. Shorten's Labor Party in polls but is still trailing, has focused his election message on the notion that Labor's spending plans would send the economy into a recession. That is a frightening prospect to Australians who have known only economic expansion for a generation.\n\nBut critics fear that any softening toward China could have much broader ramifications, putting pressure on Australia, for instance, to roll back its clampdown on foreign interference or to keep silent on Chinese human rights abuses.\n\nMr. Morrison's warier stance on China was crystallized by remarks he made on Monday when asked about the protracted trade war between Washington and Beijing. He said that he would not pick sides, saying, \"You stand by your friends, and you stand by your customers as well.\"\n\nThe prime minister's branding of China as a \"customer\" drew derision from Mr. Shorten, who promised \"a bit more sophistication\" in handling ties between the countries. For decades, Australia's economy has been buoyed by the export of natural resources to China, as well as money from Chinese students, tourists and investors.\n\nIt's clear which leader Chinese officials prefer: Social media accounts on WeChat affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party have mocked Mr. Morrison and his government. One account disparaged \"a country whose head has been kicked hard by kangaroos\" and now wanted to be friends again after a rough patch.\n\nRegardless of who wins the election, Australia will continue to face profound questions over how it balances the economic necessity of cooperating with China with the imperative of protecting its national security interests. Australia is also grappling with its place in the Asia-Pacific region, and the world beyond, as China seeks to expand its economic and military power.\n\nThe relationship between the two countries has grown strained in recent years as the Australian government, heeding warnings from national security leaders, has pushed back against Beijing's attempts to expand its reach within the country's corporations, universities and national institutions, including Parliament.\n\nThe Australian government passed legislation cracking down on foreign interference and secret lobbying on behalf of foreign interests. It also banned the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from seeking a contract to install fifth-generation cellular networks in Australia, citing potential threats to national security.\n\nBeijing, in turn, has held up Australian coal and wine imports, and is believed to be behind a cyberattack that infiltrated the networks of the federal Parliament and the three main political parties. (China has dismissed the hacking allegations as a smear campaign.)\n\nChina has also bypassed the federal government by signing deals with individual Australian states as part of its gargantuan Belt and Road infrastructure initiative -- a global push that the United States and other critics say has lacked transparency and trapped partners in debt.\n\nWhile it is seen as unlikely that Mr. Shorten, who declined requests for an interview, would reverse the government's ban on Huawei, his party has indicated that it is open to signing on to the Belt and Road program.\n\n\"The fact that Australia is this ally that sits geographically parked in the Asia-Pacific does put it very much in the cross hairs of China's worldview, particularly on the idea of splintering and weakening the U.S. alliance system,\" said Euan Graham, the executive director of La Trobe Asia, a department of La Trobe University in Melbourne.\n\nThe Labor Party has traditionally promoted itself as more independent of American foreign policy compared with the conservative coalition, which under Prime Minister John Howard sent Australian troops into Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Shorten said that Mr. Trump's views on some issues were \"barking mad.\" When asked by a television audience this year how he would reconcile those comments should he meet with Mr. Trump as prime minister, Mr. Shorten said he would deal with Mr. Trump \"professionally and politely.\"\n\n\"But you ask, China or America? In Australia, we're smart enough to work with all of them to Australia's long-term interest if we behave in a smart and respectful fashion,\" Mr. Shorten told the audience.\n\nTwo recent cases involving public figures with ties to Australia may offer a glimpse of how Mr. Shorten would carry out that \"respectful\" approach.\n\nMr. Shorten has been reluctant to publicly criticize China over its detention of a Chinese-Australian novelist, Yang Hengjun, saying the case should not be handled through \"megaphone diplomacy.\" But in the case of Bahraini soccer player Hakeem al-Araibi, who had been granted asylum in Australia, Mr. Shorten's party directly contacted the authorities in Thailand, where Mr. al-Araibi was being held, to urge his release.\n\nIf China senses a friendlier stance from a Labor government, human rights is likely to be one of the areas where it would try to push first, said Giovanni Di Lieto, an international trade law expert at Monash University in Melbourne.\n\n\"That will be the real litmus test,\" he said.\n\nMr. Shorten is hoping to shift the debate on the proper approach toward China, which has largely been driven by a sharp divide between the country's business community and its national security establishment.\n\nConnections to China run deep in the Labor Party, and have been a sore point at times. One of Mr. Shorten's mentors, former Prime Minister Paul Keating, was until recently the chairman of the advisory board for the China Development Bank, which has poured nearly $200 billion into Belt and Road projects.\n\nAnd Bob Carr, a former Labor foreign minister, has essentially become one of the Chinese government's most effective spokesmen, and now heads a university institute dedicated to Chinese-Australian relations.\n\nWhile the governing coalition has had its share of China-connected scandals as well, the shadows have been especially hard for Labor to cast off.\n\nDuring one election campaign debate, a coalition government minister began reeling off the names of past Labor politicians who had taken on Chinese-funded roles after leaving politics.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_tarabay@nytimes.com", "name": "Jamie Tarabay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/world/15oz-shorten-1/15oz-shorten-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4785042", "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 295642980}, {"uri": "1136482703", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-15", "time": "09:22:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-15T09:22:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/business/us-china-trade-war-economy.html", "title": "The Global Economy Was Improving. Then the Fighting Resumed.", "body": "LONDON -- In ordinary times, worries about the health of the global economy tend to prompt leaders of the largest countries to join forces in pursuit of safety.\n\nThese are not ordinary times.\n\nThe biggest threat to global fortunes has become the intensifying conflict between the two largest economies on earth, the United States and China. As their leaders openly contemplate how to inflict pain on each other, the rest of the world now frets about becoming collateral damage in an escalating trade war.\n\nOnly a week ago, China and the United States appeared to be moving toward cooling their hostilities, while global economic prospects were improving. Worries about a worldwide slowdown were giving way to burnished hopes for expansion.\n\nFears about the weakening of China's economy were easing as President Trump advertised a soon-to-be-signed trade deal. That lifted the outlook for Asian economies dependent on global commerce like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Europe, a perpetual source of concern, was flashing signs of renewal. Defying skeptics, the American economy remained on a tear.\n\nBut late last week, as Mr. Trump sharply increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, the world found itself grappling with the likelihood that the trade war will cost treasure. The concern mounted on Monday as Beijing retaliated and the Trump administration detailed plans to slap 25 percent tariffs on virtually all goods that China sends to the United States.\n\nFor businesses and consumers alike, it all raised the prospect that they would soon be paying higher prices for goods, a reality that discourages commerce.\n\n\"An escalation scenario would be terrible all around,\" said Gabriel Sterne, head of global macro research at Oxford Economics in London. \"A negative impact on trade flow is going to be bad for global growth for several years. It's bad news for almost everybody.\"\n\nIf both sides follow through on their threatened tariffs, China's annual economic output will be reduced by 0.8 percent while the United States will see its annual growth reduced by 0.3 percent, according to Oxford Economics.\n\nThose numbers are small in the grand scheme of things, but the pain could be felt acutely within industries that are especially exposed to the trade war, such as American agriculture and Chinese electronics manufacturers.\n\nThe harm could be especially severe for countries that are most dependent on trade, including Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico and Japan.\n\nAt the center of trouble sits China, the world's most populous country. Its breakneck development over recent decades has added hundreds of millions of consumers to the global marketplace while supplying a vast assemblage of low-cost goods.\n\nGiven that China is the source of roughly one-third of the world's economic growth, any disruption to its trade amounts to a global event.\n\nMr. Trump has designed his tariffs to wound China as he seeks to pressure its leaders to agree to cease subsidizing state-owned companies, stop demanding intellectual property from American businesses and open its markets to foreign competitors. Until last week, the president was insisting that a trade deal with China was imminent. Then, he abruptly accused China of reneging on its commitments and opted to increase tariffs.\n\nThe sharp escalation comes at an especially fraught time for the world economy, jeopardizing what had seemed to be a stabilizing, if gradually slowing Chinese economy.\n\nVolumes of freight imported by China surged in April, according to an analysis of data by UBS, the global investment bank. Worldwide, airfreight was up in March compared with a year earlier, according to the International Air Transport Association.\n\nBut these trends are fragile. Airfreight has declined nearly 4 percent since its peak in 2017. Outside China, manufacturing in Asia has been slowing for much of the last two years. A trade war between the United States and China -- two countries that collectively account for roughly 40 percent of world economic output -- would almost certainly aggravate the situation.\n\nExports to China from Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam have plunged by about 14 percent over the past year, or about $6.3 billion, according to analysis from Oxford Economics.\n\nThose same countries have lifted their exports to the United States by a similar percentage. But the United States is a less important trading partner, and the increase amounts to less than $2 billion.\n\nIn Europe, the trade war presents another unwanted source of concern at a time of tenuous progress.\n\nConcerns that Britain's unruly departure from the European Union would damage trade across the continent had abated -- at least in the immediate term -- as London and Brussels agreed to extend their fractious divorce proceedings until the end of October.\n\nGermany, the Continent's largest economy, had been moderating fears of weakness, with data showing an increase in factory orders and exports. Germany's exports to China were up by more than 5 percent in March compared with a year earlier.\n\nBut much of what Germany sends China amounts to the piece parts of China's industrial apparatus -- car parts, engines, electrical machinery and other gear folded into factory operations. If Chinese factory operations slow in the face of American tariffs, China's appetite for German goods will most likely wane.\n\nIn Italy and France, industrial activity has been weakening in recent months.\n\n\"For Europe, it's happening at a very delicate point in time,\" said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Norway. \"You have growth being very feeble again.\"\n\nThe trade war has already spooked global stock markets, prompting plunges in share prices that slightly reversed on Tuesday.\n\nIf investor fear deepens, money will almost certainly flow into the ultimate safe haven, the American dollar. That would most likely be accompanied by money leaving so-called emerging markets, exacerbating crises in Argentina and Turkey, while bringing down the value of currencies more broadly, from Brazil to South Africa to India.\n\nFalling currencies make imported goods more expensive in those countries, forcing poor people to pay more for food, fuel and transportation.\n\nAfter rising early this year, currencies and stock prices across emerging markets have dipped precipitously in recent weeks.\n\nThe key question now is how long trade hostilities will endure.\n\nIt is a question with no clear answer.\n\nMr. Trump appears to be taking resolve from a strong American economy as he declares a willingness to absorb the strains of a drawn-out battle with China. The unemployment rate sits at 3.6 percent, its lowest level in half a century. The economy expanded at a 3.2 percent annual clip during the first three months of the year.\n\nMr. Trump has declared that the United States can win a trade war if it stays the course. Yet he has also used Twitter to complain that the Federal Reserve is not cutting interest rates while China's leaders stimulate their economy with injections of credit.\n\nPerhaps that represents his lobbying for lower rates. It can also be read as an admission that Mr. Trump lacks -- and covets -- tools possessed by his adversaries in Beijing, who enjoy domination of the levers of policy.\n\nMr. Trump's strategy appears to be stoking nationalist anger in China, where the Communist Party government leans heavily on such sentiments for propaganda purposes. That could harden China's willingness to hold its position, as its leaders fear the consequences of gratifying an attack from the American leader.\n\nIt is not a recipe for expanded global trade, which grew by about 4 percent in 2017, then slowed to 2 percent last year and may contract this year.\n\n\"Once growth in trade volumes turns negative, it makes us all have to take a closer look at some sort of recession scenario,\" said Marie Owens Thomsen, global chief economist at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva. \"Things are looking more disconcerting for sure. The downside risks are increasing.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_s_goodman@nytimes.com", "name": "Peter S.

On May 13, The Times reported:\n\nThe United States and China intensified their trade dispute on Monday, as Beijing said it would increase tariffs on nearly $60 billion worth of American goods and the Trump administration detailed plans to tax nearly every sneaker, computer, dress and handbag that China exports to the United States.\n\nThe escalation thrust the world's two largest economies back into confrontation. While President Trump said on Monday that he would meet with China's president, Xi Jinping, next month in Japan, the stakes are only increasing as the president continues to taunt and threaten China, causing it to retaliate on American businesses.\n\nThe articles continues:\n\nChina's Finance Ministry announced Monday that it was raising tariffs on a wide range of American goods to 20 percent or 25 percent from 10 percent. The increase will affect the roughly $60 billion in American imports already being taxed as retaliation for Mr. Trump's previous round of tariffs, including beer, wine, swimsuits, shirts and liquefied natural gas exported to China.\n\nThe move came after Mr. Trump increased tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to as much as 25 percent on Friday, and threatened to move ahead with taxing the remainder of goods that the United States imports from China. The Office of the United States Trade Representative released a list on Monday of the roughly $300 billion worth of products that could face up to a 25 percent tariff and requested public comment, which will begin the formal process for enacting those duties. The list includes almost every consumer product imaginable, from coffee makers to sneakers to telescopic sights for rifles.\n\nWatch the four-minute video \"The Anatomy Of A Trade War\" from Newsy. As you watch, respond to the following questions:\n\n* What is a tariff?\n\n* Why might tariffs be considered a \"double-edged sword\"?\n\n* What is a trade war?\n\n* How do trade wars affect citizens?\n\nNow, read the article, \"U.S.-China Trade Standoff May Be Initial Skirmish in Broader Economic War,\" and answer the following questions:\n\n1. Why is the Trump administration trying to limit China's economic influence in the United States and abroad?\n\n2. How is the administration trying to restrain China's ambitions and methods of influence? Why is this a \"tricky task,\" according to the article?\n\n3. David Lampton, a China scholar at Stanford University, says the present trade war is a \"skirmish in an ongoing battle.\" What does he mean by that statement?\n\n4. Why is a trade deal unlikely to change China's behavior?\n\n5. How do many in China view the United States? How do they view China? How do these views contrast with the American perspective of the two countries?\n\n6. Why has China been resistant to the emerging terms of the trade deal?\n\n7. Since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, the prevailing view in the United States was that close economic engagement with China would produce an increasingly democratic country that would be closely tied to an international economic order founded mainly on Western liberal ideals. Did this prove to be true? Why or why not?\n\n8. How have Sino-American relations shifted in recent years? What are the future implications of this new relationship?\n\nFinally, tell us more about what you think:\n\nIs a trade war an effective way to restrain China's ambitions and methods of influence?\n\nIn \"Trump's Trade War Escalation Will Exact Economic Pain, Adviser Says,\" Jeanna Smialek, Jim Tankersley and Mark Landler write about how this conflict could affect everyday Americans:\n\nPresident Trump's chief economic adviser said on Sunday that American consumers would bear some pain from the escalating trade war with China, contradicting Mr. Trump's claim that his tariffs are a multibillion-dollar, mostly one-way payment by China to the American Treasury.\n\nThe comments from Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, came after the 11th round of trade negotiations broke off without a deal, prompting Mr. Trump to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products and begin a process to impose levies on nearly every product China exports to the United States.\n\n\"In fact, both sides will pay,\" Mr. Kudlow said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"Both sides will suffer on this.\"\n\nMr. Kudlow's acknowledgment of economic pain, while widely shared by economists, contradicted the president's view that trade wars are easy to win and that the burden falls disproportionately on America's trading partners. Mr. Trump again asserted on Monday that there was \"no reason\" that American consumers would pay the tariffs.\n\nBoth Mr. Kudlow and the president say that a protracted trade war will ultimately be in the United States' financial interest. Mr. Kudlow said that any pain would be worth the price if it forced China to treat American companies more fairly.\n\n\"You've got to do what you got to do,\" Mr. Kudlow said. \"We have had unfair trading practices all these years and so in my judgment, the economic consequences are so small that the possible improvement in trade and exports and open markets for the United States, this is worthwhile doing.\"\n\nTake a look at these lists of goods that the latest tariffs could make more expensive, including back packs, dog collars, strawberry jam and soy sauce. How many of these do you consume on a regular basis? To what extent might you and your family be affected by these tariffs?\n\nDo you agree with Mr. Trump and Mr. Kudlow that \"any pain would be worth the price if it forced China to treat American companies more fairly\"?

We've gone up trillions and trillions of dollars since the election; they've gone way down since my election.\"\n\nHe called the trade dispute \"a little squabble\" and suggested he was in no rush to end his fight, though he held out the possibility an agreement could be reached, saying: \"They want to make a deal. It could absolutely happen.\" Stock markets rebounded on Tuesday, after plunging on Monday as China and the United States resumed their tariff war.\n\nAdditional tariffs could be on the way. Mr. Trump faces a Friday deadline to determine whether the United States will proceed with his threat to impose global auto tariffs, a move that has been criticized by car companies and foreign policymakers. And despite complaints by Republican lawmakers and American companies, Mr. Trump's global metal tariffs remain in place on Canada, Mexico, Europe and other allies.\n\nThe trade barriers are putting the United States, previously a steadfast advocate of global free trade, in an unfamiliar position. The country now has the highest overall trade-weighted tariff rate at 4.2 percent, higher than any of the Group of 7 industrialized nations, according to Torsten Slok, the chief economist of Deutsche Bank Securities. That is now more than twice as high as the rate for Canada, Britain, Italy, Germany and France, and higher than most emerging markets, including Russia, Turkey and even China, Mr. Slok said.\n\n[A trade war with China could be long and painful.]\n\nThe shift is having consequences for an American economy that is dependent on global trade, including multinational companies like Boeing, General Motors, Apple, Caterpillar and other businesses that source components from abroad and want access to growing markets overseas.\n\nWhile trade accounts for a smaller percentage of the American economy than in most other countries -- just 27 percent in 2017, compared with 38 percent for China and 87 percent for Germany, according to World Bank data -- it is still a critical driver of jobs and economic growth.\n\nFor now, the American economy remains strong, with rising wages and the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. But with less trade, American jobs up and down the value chain that are seemingly unrelated to importing and exporting goods could suffer, including research and development, retail and marketing products.\n\nDouglas Irwin, a trade historian at Dartmouth College, said Mr. Trump's tariff battle with China was bringing about \"a new status quo for the world economy.\"\n\n\"If we do have this consensus that we want to isolate ourselves from China, that's a big historic shift in U.S. trade policy,\" Mr. Irwin said. \"We've moved away from tariffs as a bargaining chip to get a better deal to tariffs as a means to an end to decoupling the economies.\"\n\nMr. Trump and his economic advisers say the administration's trade policy is aiding the American economy, companies and consumers. And despite the tough approach, the administration continues to insist its goal is to strike trade agreements that give American businesses better trade terms overseas.\n\nAt a briefing last week, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, praised the president's trade policies for helping economic growth thus far and said the administration supports \"free and fair reciprocal trade.\"\n\nBut if the goal really is freer trade, the administration has never been further from achieving that goal than it is today, said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\"They're heading in the opposite direction,\" Mr. Bown said.\n\nBeyond a minor update to the United States agreement with South Korea, no other free trade deals have been finalized. Mr. Trump's revisions to the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico still await passage in Congress, while trade talks with the European Union and Japan have been troubled from the start, with governments squabbling over the scope of the agreement.\n\nThe easier explanation, said Michael Strain, the director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, is to take the president at his word that he is a protectionist.\n\n\"Those are the words they're using, and those are the actions they're taking,\" he said.\n\nIn remarks this week, Mr. Trump said companies that did not want to pay the tariffs could shift production out of China and into the United States or another country that has not been hit with tariffs. While there are signs that this shift is happening, it seems to benefiting countries like Mexico and Vietnam rather than the United States.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the president's actions will precipitate a broader shift away from global integration that might echo around the world and outlast the Trump administration.\n\nMr. Trump came into office fiercely critical of the failure of past administrations and global bodies like the World Trade Organization for failing to police China's unfair trade practices. He withdrew the United States from multilateral efforts like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multicountry trade deal negotiated by President Barack Obama, and the Paris climate accord.\n\nThat shift has created an opening for other countries to step forward as global leaders, including Europe, Japan and China, despite its position as one of the world's most controversial economic actors. On Tuesday, China submitted its proposals for overhauling the World Trade Organization, including broadening the privileges of developed countries, a status that China claims for itself.\n\nAdvocates of free trade fear that governments in India, China, South Africa and elsewhere might find Mr. Trump's model of protectionism appealing and erect even higher barriers to foreign companies.\n\nWhile the United States and China could still strike a trade deal that would roll back many of their tariffs, that likelihood has appeared to diminish in recent weeks.\n\nProgress toward a deal came to a sudden halt this month when China backtracked on certain commitments and Mr. Trump threatened to move ahead with higher tariffs.\n\n\"We had a deal that was very close, and then they broke it,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\nThe two sides continue to disagree over whether the deal's provisions must be enshrined in China's laws. But they are also arguing over Mr. Trump's tariffs, which were intended to prod the Chinese to agree to more favorable trade terms for the United States. China insists those tariffs must come off once a deal is reached, but the Trump administration wants some to remain in place, to ensure China abides by its commitments.\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday on CNBC, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, supported the administration's tactics.\n\n\"Ideally, you wouldn't have tariffs,\" he said. But the United States already faces \"all kinds of impediments\" to gaining access to the Chinese marketplace, including tariffs, subsidization of industries and theft of intellectual property.\n\n\"We already have a series of hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese penalties against the United States which are threatening our long-term viability,\" Mr. Rubio said.\n\nCanada and Mexico have repeatedly pressed the administration to lift its tariffs on steel and aluminum now that negotiations over the Nafta revision are done. The three countries signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in November, but the pact awaits passage in all three legislatures.\n\nThe Trump administration still views the tariffs as a source of leverage in case it needs to demand final changes to the deal from Canada and Mexico. But Canadian and Mexican officials -- as well as many in Congress -- say the levies are actually an impediment because all three legislatures will refuse to finalize the deal while they are in place.\n\nA similar standoff could soon unfold with the European Union, which Mr. Trump has accused of being a \"brutal trading partner\" and being \"tougher than China.\"\n\nThe president, who wants Europe to open its markets to American farmers and companies, has already imposed tariffs on European metals and is threatening to levy a 25 percent tax on imports of European cars and car parts if the bloc does not give the United States better trade terms.\n\nEurope has absorbed Mr. Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs without too much damage. But car tariffs would strike the most important industry in Germany, which has the Continent's biggest economy. European officials would regard car tariffs as a breach of a truce they worked out last year with Mr. Trump, and they have said they would refuse to negotiate as long as car tariffs were in place.\n\nCecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, repeated on Monday that the European Union had prepared a list of American products worth $22.5 billion -- including ketchup, suitcases and tractors -- that would face immediate retaliatory tariffs.\n\n\"We're prepared for the worst,\" Ms. Malmstrom said in an interview with the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper in Germany.\n\nEuropean officials still hold out hope that Mr. Trump will see them as allies and not geopolitical rivals like the Chinese. And he could ultimately delay the decision and extend the Friday deadline for countries that are in trade talks with the United States.\n\nBut the president shows no signs of backing away from his stance that tariffs have helped the United States.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that tariffs had rebuilt America's steel industry and were encouraging companies to leave China, making it \"more competitive\" for buyers in the United States.\n\n\"China buys MUCH less from us than we buy from them, by almost 500 Billion Dollars, so we are in a fantastic position,\" Mr. Trump tweeted. \"Make your product at home in the USA and there is no Tariff.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/14/world/14dc-trade-print/merlin_154532736_ccf8fe3f-b205-4db0-b09a-d4bb0e5856f0-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4783551", "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 295563480}, {"uri": "1136075001", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-14", "time": "20:34:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-14T20:34:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/politics/republicans-balk-at-more-tariffs-as-trump-mulls-more-farm-aid.html", "title": "Republicans Balk at More Tariffs as Trump Mulls More Farm Aid", "body": "WASHINGTON -- At a White House meeting earlier this month, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the powerful Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, pressed President Trump to repeal the metal tariffs he imposed on Canada and Mexico, which he argued were hurting the struggling farmers the president had vowed to protect.\n\nHours later, Mr. Trump made clear that the message was not received.\n\n\"Tariffs are working,\" the president said on Twitter, attributing an investment announced by U.S. Steel to the steel and aluminum tariffs Mr. Trump put into effect last year.\n\nMr. Trump sold his trade disputes with China, Canada, Mexico and Europe as an effort to lower trade barriers. But the rewritten North American Free Trade Agreement has stalled in Congress, Europe is preparing retaliation in the event that Mr. Trump unleashes automobile tariffs this week and negotiations with China have broken down, devolving into an all-out trade war.\n\nThe collateral damage has been America's farmers, and Mr. Grassley, a generally loyal ally to the president, has emerged as his chief critic on trade.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Grassley, an Iowa farmer himself, warned that Mr. Trump could face political consequences if the pain that farmers are feeling continues to fester.\n\n\"It's going to have some impact on elections, of course,\" Mr. Grassley said. \"So far, I haven't seen farmers abandoning Trump, but it's going to have some impact.\"\n\nMr. Trump last week raised tariff rates on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent and threatened to impose tariffs on another $300 billion of Chinese goods if negotiations continue to falter. On Monday, China hit back with tariffs as high as 25 percent on $60 billion of American goods, effective June 1.\n\nMr. Trump, cognizant of China's penchant for hitting where it hurts, said he expected Beijing to once again retaliate against America's farmers by slowing or stopping purchases of agricultural products, like soybeans and farm equipment.\n\nThe administration, which provided $12 billion in aid to farmers last year to mitigate the effects of the trade war, is developing plans for another bailout this year. Mr. Trump suggested this week that he will provide another $15 billion in financial support to farmers, potentially funded through the tariffs he is imposing on Chinese imports.\n\n\"Our great Patriot Farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now,\" Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nThe predicament facing farmers as a result of the trade war is grim.\n\nPrices of soybeans, pork and cotton all slumped this week after China retaliated against the United States. JP Morgan on Tuesday downgraded the stock of Deere, the farm equipment manufacturer, warning that the agriculture sector is \"rapidly deteriorating\" and that additional farm aid would likely do little to buttress the fortunes of farmers.\n\nWhile Mr. Grassley supports the need to confront China, he made clear that the tariffs must go.\n\n\"I'm no fan of tariffs,\" Mr. Grassley said. \"I'm disappointed by the news of additional tariffs out of Beijing and here in Washington. Both countries are going to be hurt.\"\n\nGovernment subsidies are generally anathema to conservative economic orthodoxy. As Republicans grapple with Mr. Trump's trade policy, some Republicans have quietly come to accept them, while others insist that they only make matters worse.\n\nSenator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, told reporters on Tuesday that the proposed bailout sounds \"inadequate\" to deal with the problem, adding that \"it won't supply the benefit in terms of the demand and market share that a trade deal would.\"\n\nAmong the most vocal critics of Mr. Trump's plans to subsidize farmers is Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania. On Tuesday he sharply criticized the White House's strategy with China, arguing that \"Americans were paying the price\" of Mr. Trump's recent moves.\n\nMr. Toomey, who represents a state whose agricultural sector mainly relies on domestic consumption, called Mr. Trump's second round of payouts \"a handout\" that would saddle taxpayers with debt.\n\n\"The term is meant to be pejorative because it's a very bad policy,\" he said. \"I mean, think about what we're doing -- we're inviting this retaliation that denies our farmers, the most productive farmers on the planet, the opportunity to sell their products overseas and then we say, 'Don't worry, we'll have taxpayers send you some checks and make it O.K.' \"\n\nFarmers say that they would prefer free trade over government subsidies. But with exports of products such as wheat and soybeans to China drying up, they are willing to take whatever help they can get.\n\n\"It's going to be needed,\" said John Heisdorffer, a soybean producer from Keota, Iowa, and chairman of the American Soybean Association. \"I hear from so many farmers now, how they're struggling.\"\n\nMr. Heisdorffer said that many farmers are feeling emotionally drained by the ups and downs of the trade negotiations with China and that he hopes Mr. Trump can find a way to roll back all the tariffs.\n\n\"At this point, I still hear a lot of support for the president,\" he said. \"We support what he's doing, but we felt all the time that there was a different way than tariffs to have done it.\"\n\nBut Mr. Trump thus far has shown little interest in changing course. Before boarding Marine One on Tuesday, the president described the economic battle with China as a \"little squabble\" and said that the United States would win in the end.\n\nFor lawmakers such as Mr. Grassley, who espouse the virtues of free trade, the stubbornness of the squabble has amounted to growing frustration. The senator from Iowa said this week that he intended to begin sending his concerns to Mr. Trump in writing.\n\n\"I'm not sure if you talk to him face to face he hears everything you say,\" Mr. Grassley said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alan_rappeport@nytimes.com", "name": "Alan Rappeport", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/14/business/14DC-FARMTRADE-01/14DC-FARMTRADE-01-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4785184", "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 295562040}, {"uri": "1136031252", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-14", "time": "19:21:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-14T19:21:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/business/us-china-tariffs.html", "title": "In China, Some Fear the End of 'Chimerica'", "body": "Wu Shichun is one of countless Chinese entrepreneurs who over the past four decades have prospered from access to American customers and money.\n\nToday, as the American government threatens to take that away, the serial entrepreneur and venture capital investor is fundamentally rethinking how he does business.\n\nOne of his portfolio companies designs and makes fashion products in China, then sells to American consumers on Amazon.com.

The trade hawks hope to get American companies to shift their factories to friendlier countries. They are pushing to restrict Chinese investment in the United States and cut academic and other bonds.\n\nNow many people in China are wondering what will happen if the countries decouple.

He hopes and is confident that the two countries can reach a deal.\n\n\"China and the U.S. don't have to have strained relations,\" he said.\n\nMany also appear worried that the trade war and the government's tightening control over the private sector could halt or even reverse its progress. In a country only a couple of generations removed from starvation, the possibility doesn't seem far-fetched to many.

The United States blames China for heavy job losses, theft of corporate secrets and cheating at the rules of global trade.

Now the United States wants China to change its economic growth model, the author argued, while China only wants to buy more American products to solve short-term trade imbalances.\n\n\"Chimerica parted ways on May 10,\" the author wrote. \"Now it's time to decide whether to adopt the U.S. rules or the Chinese rules.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "li_yuan@nytimes.com", "name": "Li Yuan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/14/business/14NEWWORLD-1/merlin_154605039_78d1dec8-9ed7-4e54-9472-0a1b7c34f548-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4783551", "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 295547100}, {"uri": "1135855417", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-14", "time": "15:13:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-14T15:13:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4392156898975372, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/upshot/us-china-trade-war.html", "title": "Why the U.S.-China Trade War Could Be Long and Painful: No Off-Ramps", "body": "There's a shrinking supply of the 'constructive ambiguity' that would let each side present a deal as a win.\n\nJust two weeks ago, the United States and China seemed to be gliding toward a trade deal meant to resolve tensions between the world's two largest economies.\n\nBut the breakdown in talks since then -- including the United States raising tariffs to 25 percent on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatening to tax an additional $300 billion -- worries people who study international economic diplomacy.\n\nThat's because both the United States and China seem to be digging into their positions in ways that will be hard to resolve with the kinds of mutual face-saving that typically turns high-stakes negotiations into deals.\n\nTo use a common negotiating metaphor, it is not clear what the off-ramps are that might allow a de-escalation and prevent a major trade war that would prove costly to both nations.\n\nIn effect, President Trump appears to view continuing tension with China as good for him politically and has said, contrary to the view of mainstream economists, that tariffs are a reason for the United States' recent economic good fortune.\n\nChina's leaders may not reveal their thinking in real time on Twitter, but they have signaled that many of the concessions the United States wants would require China to sacrifice core parts of its economic strategy and national sovereignty -- in particular its ambitions to lead in the high-tech industries of the future.\n\n\"Each side has dug itself into some fairly deep holes such that it will be difficult to emerge from,\" said Douglas Rediker, chairman of International Capital Strategies and a former U.S. representative to the International Monetary Fund. As is often the case in negotiations, the pathway to a deal may rest in \"constructive ambiguity\" that both sides can present to their domestic audiences as a win.\n\n\"Do I believe there's enough room to find common ground?\" Mr. Rediker said. \"Yes, but only based on this ambiguity that doesn't necessarily resolve the issues in one party's favor or another.\"\n\nBoth sides have taken subtle steps to allow time for last-ditch efforts at some agreement. China sent a senior negotiator to Washington last week despite the breakdown in talks, and it delayed the start of its retaliatory tariffs on American imports until June 1; the United States applied the newest wave of higher tariffs based on when ships containing the affected goods arrive, adding a few weeks in which a reversal could be hammered out.\n\nAnd President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China could meet at the G20 summit in late June in Osaka, Japan, which would be an opportunity for de-escalation at the highest levels.\n\nBut open lines of communication and time to work won't by themselves solve the problem of how to finesse some mutually agreeable deal -- particularly given that both countries view this negotiation as resetting their economic relationship in ways that would have long-lasting consequences.\n\nAdd in Mr. Trump's tendency to view every negotiation through a zero-sum prism, and it may be hard to find a pathway for both parties to go home able to proclaim victory.\n\nWhen the negotiations seemed to be going well a few weeks ago, \"I thought we were going toward constructive ambiguity,\" said Mary E. Lovely, an economist and trade expert at Syracuse University's Maxwell School.\n\nThe United States is demanding that China codify rules to protect American companies and their technology doing business in China into law. Chinese negotiators now reject that possibility (American officials have said they earlier agreed to those provisions).\n\n\"It looks like there was a level of specificity that China wasn't willing to accept and a level of ambiguity that the Trump administration wasn't willing to accept,\" Ms. Lovely said. \"It looks like the Chinese are firm that there are some areas where they are not willing to go, that they see as disrespectful.\"\n\nIf the escalation now being signaled by both sides goes into force, it will mean Americans face higher prices for a wide range of the goods they buy, and certain American manufacturers will face less demand for their products. Already, American farmers are suffering amid reduced Chinese demand for American soybeans and other products. The Chinese manufacturing sector is hurting as well -- and is likely to suffer further if tariffs reduce American demand for their products or drive relocation of production to other countries.\n\nUltimately the question becomes how much of that pain each side will be willing to endure, and whether the two nations' leaders feel a sense of urgency to each help the other save face domestically.\n\nThings can change quickly. In a different sphere, for example, Mr. Trump went from threatening North Korea with nuclear annihilation to acting like old friends practically overnight.\n\nBut given where things stand, it may take that kind of surprising reset between two top leaders, built on personal relationships, rather than the slow grind of hammering out an agreement that is more typical of economic diplomacy.\n\n\"The off-ramps are tricky here because the president believes this is good policy and the Chinese are loath to cave on it,\" said Jay Shambaugh, a professor of international economics at George Washington University and director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. \"It's not abundantly clear how you climb down without any damage.\"\n\nThe question for the weeks and months ahead is how much damage each side will tolerate before rethinking some of those basic assumptions and deciding that they don't want to dig in quite so hard, after all.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_irwin@nytimes.com", "name": "Neil Irwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/14/upshot/up-trade/up-trade-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4783551", "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 295542780}, {"uri": "1135491778", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-14", "time": "07:17:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-14T07:17:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/arts/television/stephen-colbert-trumps-trade-war.html", "title": "Stephen Colbert Says It's Too Late to Rebrand Trump's Trade War", "body": "Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night's highlights that lets you sleep -- and lets us get paid to watch comedy.

And then Trump fired back with, 'I believe the word is vegetable.'\" -- JIMMY FALLON\n\nAnd while Trump insists that China will foot the bill for the tariffs, his chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said that both China and the United States would end up paying.\n\n\"[As Trump] 'It's paid mostly by China. Largely. Somewhat. Kinda sorta. I mean, that's what I heard. They don't pay anything. We're screwed.'\" -- STEPHEN COLBERT\n\nDuring an appearance on Fox News, Kudlow requested the phrase \"trade war\" be traded in for \"trade negotiation,\" which Colbert cried foul over.\n\n\"No, you can't.

The United States trade representative on Monday detailed a list of what would face a tax of as much as 25 percent, which includes nearly 4,000 product categories.\n\nMr. Trump said on Monday he had not yet decided whether to impose the tariffs, but his administration has begun the formal process necessary for the United States to make good on his threat.\n\nOfficials said that the new batch of tariffs \"covers essentially all products not currently covered\" by Mr. Trump's existing tariffs on Chinese imports, but that the list \"excludes pharmaceuticals, certain pharmaceutical inputs, select medical goods, rare earth materials, and critical minerals.\"\n\nSo what would get hit with tariffs? The list reads like a shopping list for Target or Walmart, including toys, shoes, coffee makers and watches. Smartphones, photocopiers and video game consoles will face a tax. Also included are guns, fireworks, backgammon, Christmas decorations, practical joke toys, furs (with or without paws) and merry-go-rounds.\n\nThe list includes nearly 40 Chinese import categories that Americans collectively spent $1 billion or more on in 2017, according to government statistics. The largest among those, at $44.5 billion, are cellphones, followed by laptops at $37.2 billion and toys at $12.2 billion.\n\nHere's a quick scan of other consumer favorites that will be subject to tariffs if Mr. Trump follows through:\n\nHousewares\n\nKitchenware\n\nLED lamps\n\nFlags\n\nMicrowave ovens\n\nCurtains and drapes\n\nCoffee makers\n\nHair dryers\n\nBed linens\n\nClothing\n\nSweaters\n\nShoes, including golf shoes, boots, running shoes and other footwear\n\nBras\n\nGloves\n\nSunglasses\n\nWigs and facial hair made of human hair\n\nT-shirts\n\nTrack suits\n\nTech\n\nSmartphones, like iPhones\n\nFlat-panel televisions\n\nCopiers and fax machines\n\nVideo cameras\n\nLithium ion batteries\n\nKeyboards\n\nLoudspeakers\n\nSporting goods\n\nGolf clubs\n\nWater skis, surf boards and other water sport equipment\n\nBicycle parts\n\nFishing rods\n\nMilitary rifles, shotguns and their parts\n\nRocket launchers and flame throwers\n\nDrugstore essentials\n\nGreeting cards\n\nArtificial flowers\n\nFlashlights\n\nPens\n\nMr. Trump has insisted that the tariffs will not raise prices for consumers, saying that China will bear the brunt of the taxes, a view that many economists dispute.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump encouraged companies to avoid tariffs by moving production out of China and into the United States or a country like Vietnam. He said the next round of tariffs represented \"a tremendous amount of money that would come into our country.\"\n\nShifting production across borders would be difficult for some consumer-facing companies to do quickly, said Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS and former head of the price and wage section at the Federal Reserve.\n\nThat means consumers could have little choice but to pay more for those goods, or buy fewer of them. It's likely that the result will be higher consumer inflation.

Mr. Kudlow said that any pain would be worth the price if it forced China to treat American companies more fairly.\n\n\"You've got to do what you got to do,\" Mr. Kudlow said. \"We have had unfair trading practices all these years and so in my judgment, the economic consequences are so small that the possible improvement in trade and exports and open markets for the United States, this is worthwhile doing.\"\n\nNegotiations between the countries broke down last week after administration officials accused the Chinese of backtracking on several key provisions of a proposed deal, including changes to Chinese law. Administration officials insist the talks have been constructive, and say they will continue, possibly including a meeting next month between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China at the Group of 20 summit meeting next month in Osaka, Japan. But Mr. Trump has muddied that message with tweets suggesting he would be happy to leave tariffs in place indefinitely.\n\nMr. Trump's confidence in the strength of the American economy is fueling his decision to escalate the trade fight. But it is an economic gamble, one that could inflict lasting damage depending on how far Mr. Trump is willing to take his battle and what it produces in the end.\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday, Mr. Trump said the United States was \"right where we want to be with China,\" adding that the United States \"will be taking in Tens of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs from China.\"\n\nEconomists differ on how much the trade war will crimp economic growth, but most agree that the cost of tariffs is passed on to businesses or consumers in the form of higher prices on everything, including lighting fixtures and art supplies. Among the items covered by the administration's latest increase in tariffs to 25 percent: computers, toilet paper, dog collars, Christmas tree lights and mattress supports.\n\nThe new tariff will not knock the American economy into recession, forecasters say, but it will hurt economic growth -- and could do so drastically -- if Mr. Trump follows through with his plan to place the tariff on all imports from China.\n\nThe United States imported $540 billion worth of goods from China in 2018, according to government statistics.\n\n\"Trump is dragging a dangerous misconception into a critical moment in his standoff with the Chinese,\" Chad Bown, an expert on trade at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said last week. \"And American businesses and consumers stand to pay the price.\"\n\nTariffs enacted last year reduced the inflation-adjusted income of American consumers by $4.4 billion each month by November, according to one study. That loss, which arose both from the tariff and from more expensive or foregone imports, breaks out to about $419 per household over a year. The latest round of increases will push the per-household cost above $800, said David Weinstein, a Columbia University economist and a co-author on the research.\n\nMr. Trump and his advisers insist his approach will ultimately pay off for the American economy -- either by prodding China to open its markets and treat American firms more fairly, or by encouraging companies to shift manufacturing to the United States to avoid tariffs.\n\nBut the decision to prolong the trade war could upend economic projections that showed robust hiring, growth and investment this year, in part because of fading concerns about a protracted trade fight. And it could defy steady predictions by administration economists that Mr. Trump's trade policy will help increase growth in 2019 to 3.2 percent -- well above what most other forecasters expect.\n\n\"There is absolutely no question that these tariffs, if imposed and sustained, increase the probability of a recession,\" Rob Martin, a former Fed section chief who is now an executive director at UBS, said of a potential escalation. \"It makes you more vulnerable.\"\n\nMr. Martin and his colleagues estimate that Mr. Trump's latest increase could shave 0.25 to 0.35 percentage points off gross domestic product over six months. If the remainder of China's products get hit with a 25 percent tariff, it could shave up to another full percentage point from G.D.P.\n\n\"If we move into that next tranche of tariffs, we're in 100 percent uncharted territory,\" Mr. Martin said. The products in that category are about two-thirds consumer goods and for many -- which could include toys, bicycles and iPhones -- it could be hard to find quick substitutes.\n\nBut a prolonged trade war could inflict damage on China's economy. Economic growth in China slowed in the second half of last year, in part because tariffs hurt business confidence. Since then, the Chinese government has poured billions of dollars into the financial system and pressed state-run banks into service extending credit.\n\nOfficials said last month that the economy grew 6.4 percent in the first quarter of the year, matching the pace from the previous quarter.\n\nBut Mr. Trump is clearly banking on a protracted fight to shift the economic calculus, warning China in a tweet that \"a deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term.\"\n\nWhile Mr. Trump is confident in his approach, his decision to add new trade barriers with China -- in the form of higher tariffs -- has confounded analysts and some business groups that have otherwise praised his handling of the economy.\n\nAnalysts at the Tax Foundation, a Washington think tank that forecast a large increase to economic growth from the tax cuts Mr. Trump signed in 2017, now say that the tariffs the president has put in place or threatened -- and the effects of Chinese retaliatory tariffs on American exporters -- would more than cancel out all the economic benefits of the tax law.\n\n\"The tariffs, if allowed to continue, will mute the economic benefits of tax reform,\" said Nicole M. Kaeding, a Tax Foundation economist -- particularly for low- and middle-income consumers who will be stuck paying higher prices. \"Economists argue about many things, but the impact of tariffs on the economy is not debated. They are harmful.\"\n\nMany of those groups say growth would be even stronger this year if Mr. Trump had reached a deal with China and averted a prolonged government shutdown. They blame Mr. Trump's fundamental misunderstanding of tariffs -- which he believes are lifting the economy -- for driving the country into a danger zone.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs said in a research note that further escalation of the trade war could reduce growth by nearly half a percentage point this year, and that \"if trade tensions sparked a major sell-off in the equity market, the growth impact could worsen considerably.\"\n\nStocks swooned last week but had begun to rebound by Friday afternoon. Financial conditions have tightened, but remain well below levels seen late last year.\n\n\"So far, U.S. markets don't express a lot of concern -- I think everybody expects a deal,\" said Roberto Perli, an economist at Cornerstone Macro. \"The risk is that time passes, nothing happens and the market realizes -- maybe we were too optimistic.\"\n\nMr. Trump has expressed satisfaction with \"big beautiful tariffs\" that he said were producing \"billions of dollars\" for America.\n\n\"I am very happy with over $100 Billion a year in Tariffs filling U.S. coffers...great for U.S., not good for China,\" Mr. Trump said on Twitter last week.\n\nOf the $419-per-household cost of last year's tariffs, most of the hit -- $286 -- came from the levy itself. Because the American government collected that money, it was able to redistribute it, including through a $12 billion program of farm subsidies. But that could change as the trade war persists.\n\n\"It's pretty likely that the tariff revenue is going to fall,\" Mr. Weinstein of Columbia University said, as firms find themselves unable to shoulder the higher rates and stop importing from China. \"We're going to see a lot of supply chains shifting around.\"\n\nThat means Chinese companies will also lose out as businesses buy more American-made goods or continue turning to other low-cost producers outside China, like Vietnam and Malaysia.\n\nMr. Trump's shift on tariffs appears to have surprised Fed officials, who had been expecting the trade dispute to calm down. This month, the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, told reporters at a news conference that risks to growth from trade policy had \"moderated somewhat,\" citing \"reports of progress in the trade talks between the United States and China.\"\n\nIt is unlikely that Mr. Powell and his colleagues will react quickly to the higher tariffs and renewed trade war. The Fed will most likely judge any inflation that comes from trade policy as temporary, and may want to see economic growth weakening before acting on it through a rate cut or other measures.\n\n\"The Fed is unlikely to act immediately, in part because it is unclear whether this drama will end in a deal, an all-out trade war or something in between,\" said Krishna Guha, head of the Global Policy and Central Bank Strategy team at advisory firm Evercore ISI.\n\nIf the central bank does react, it is more likely that it would cut rates to offset the economic pain. Raphael Bostic, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said at a National Association for Business Economics conference last week that the tariff increase could prompt a rate cut if higher costs cause consumers to pull back, \"depending on the severity of the response.\"\n\nMr. Guha concurred, saying that the Fed would not hesitate to react if there were signs of a real risk to economic growth. Instead, they will most likely \"cut rates on insurance grounds, in particular given weak inflation.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeanna_smialek@nytimes.com", "name": "Jeanna Smialek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/13/business/12DC-tradeecon/12DC-tradeecon-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4783551", "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 295403580}, {"uri": "1134310973", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-12", "time": "18:59:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-12T18:59:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5960784554481506, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/us/politics/larry-kudlow-trump-trade.html", "title": "Kudlow Breaks With Trump, Saying 'Both Sides Will Pay' in Trade War With China", "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump's chief economic adviser said on Sunday that American consumers would bear a burden from the escalating trade war with China, contradicting Mr. Trump's claim that his tariffs were a multibillion-dollar, one-way payment by China to the United States Treasury.\n\nThe adviser, Larry Kudlow, made his comments two days after negotiations for a trade deal with China broke off and Mr. Trump followed through on a threat to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese exports.\n\n\"In fact, both sides will pay,\" Mr. Kudlow said in an interview on Fox News. \"Both sides will pay in these things.\"\n\nMr. Kudlow's acknowledgment was merely a recognition of Economics 101. But it flew in the face of one of the president's favorite arguments: that trade wars are easy to win, and that the pain falls disproportionately on America's trading partners, which he accuses of having exploited the United States for years through predatory trade practices.\n\nAfter months of pressing urgently for a deal with China, Mr. Trump abruptly shifted course in the past week, stung by what he viewed as its attempt to renege on key parts of a draft agreement. The president declared he was ready to prolong the standoff with Beijing because the cost of a trade war is much higher for the Chinese, with their huge numbers of exports to the United States, than it is for Americans.\n\n\"Talks with China continue in a very congenial manner,\" Mr. Trump said Friday on Twitter. \"There is absolutely no need to rush -- as Tariffs are NOW being paid to the United States by China of 25% on 250 Billion Dollars worth of goods & products. These massive payments go directly to the Treasury of the U.S.\"\n\nHe went even further in a subsequent tweet, claiming that tariffs would \"bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind\" -- a statement that seemed to undercut his administration's contention that China has robbed American companies of billions of dollars through coercive practices like the forced transfer of technology and unfair licensing agreements.\n\nThere is no doubt that China is being buffeted by the tariffs, which could soon apply to virtually everything it exports to the United States. Mr. Kudlow said economic growth in China would slow down as its exports diminished. He argued that the effect on the American economy would be modest -- only a 0.2 percent reduction in growth -- even if Mr. Trump extended tariffs across the board, as he has threatened to do.\n\n\"You got to do what you got to do,\" Mr. Kudlow said. \"In my judgment, the economic consequences are so small but the possible improvement in trade, and exports, and open market for the United States -- this is worthwhile doing.\"\n\nThe Chinese government said on Sunday that the door to resolving the impasse was always open, but that it would not yield on matters of principle, according to state news media. There are no winners in a trade war, The People's Daily newspaper said in a commentary carried by the official Xinhua News Agency on Sunday. China does not want to fight, the newspaper said, but it is not afraid to do so.\n\nWhile economists differ on how much the trade war will crimp economic growth, most agree that the cost of tariffs is passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices on everything, including lighting fixtures and art supplies. Among the items covered by the administration's latest increase in tariffs to 25 percent: computers, toilet paper, dog collars, Christmas tree lights and mattress supports.\n\n\"Trump is dragging a dangerous misconception into a critical moment in his standoff with the Chinese,\" Chad Bown, an expert on trade at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said last week. \"And American businesses and consumers stand to pay the price.\"\n\nMr. Kudlow held open the prospect of progress: He said that Mr. Trump was likely to meet President Xi Jinping of China at the Group of 20 summit meeting next month in Osaka, Japan.\n\nIt was hard to tell if Mr. Trump's hard line was merely a negotiating tactic. But as the 2020 election campaign begins, he is showing clear signs that he views standing firm as a winning political strategy.\n\nAt a rally last week in Florida, he criticized the current Democratic front-runner, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., for being weak in his dealings with foreign leaders, and ridiculed the prospect of Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., negotiating with the Chinese president.\n\nFormer aides have also warned Mr. Trump against signing a watered-down agreement, saying that it could become fodder for Democrats, particularly progressives like Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, who has staked out a position on China trade as hawkish as that of Mr. Trump.\n\nFor his part, the president has argued that China's decision to pull back from an agreement last week reflected Beijing's calculation that it could extract a better deal from a Democratic president.\n\n\"I think that China felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election, 2020, to see if they could get lucky & have a Democrat win,\" Mr. Trump tweeted on Saturday, \"in which case they would continue to rip-off the USA for $500 Billion a year.\"\n\n\"The only problem,\" Mr. Trump added, \"is that they know I am going to win (best economy & employment numbers in U.S. history, & much more), and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term. Would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting BIG TARIFFS!\"\n\nThe daylight between Mr. Kudlow and his boss on tariffs is not unusual in this administration. There are also fissures between the president and his national security team on how to deal with adversaries like Iran and North Korea. But the resulting muddle in the administration's messages has fueled criticism from former officials that this White House does not have a coherent plan for dealing with China.\n\n\"The Chinese have an advantage because they have a strategy and we don't,\" Robert M. Gates, who served as defense secretary to Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said Sunday on the CBS News program \"Face the Nation.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_landler@nytimes.com", "name": "Mark Landler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/12/us/politics/12dc-trumptrade/merlin_154330416_a08b0a2e-ae27-4266-a8ea-1d408d25d222-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4783551", "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 295383540}, {"uri": "1133687142", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-11", "time": "17:22:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-11T17:22:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/world/asia/us-china-trade-war.html", "title": "Trade Standoff May Be Initial Skirmish in Broader U.S.-China Economic War", "body": "WASHINGTON -- A yearlong trade war between the United States and China is proving to be an initial skirmish in an economic conflict that may persist for decades, as both countries battle for global dominance, stature and wealth.\n\nProgress toward a trade agreement nearly collapsed this past week, with both sides hardening their bargaining positions. And even if a trade deal is reached, it may do little to resolve tensions between the world's two largest economies.\n\nThe United States is increasingly wary of China's emerging role in the global economy and the tactics it uses to get ahead, including state-sponsored hacking, acquisitions of high-tech companies in the United States and Europe, subsidies to crucial industries and discrimination against foreign companies.\n\nThe Trump administration has begun trying to limit China's economic influence in the United States and abroad, warning about China's ambitions in increasingly stark terms. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, compared China's ambitions to Russia and Iran in a speech in London last Wednesday, saying Beijing poses \"a new kind of challenge; an authoritarian regime that's integrated economically into the West in ways that the Soviet Union never was.\"\n\nThe United States has been erecting barriers to limit Chinese investment in American companies, re-examining the kinds of technology that can be exported to China and restricting China's role in building America's next-generation telecommunications networks, while also discouraging other countries from using Chinese equipment.\n\nThe F.B.I. has increased its scrutiny of Chinese researchers in the United States over fears they may be acquiring intellectual secrets. A Justice Department initiative is targeting commercial espionage of American technology, and earlier this year the United States unveiled a sweeping indictment of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, over accusations of stealing trade secrets and evading American sanctions on Iran.\n\nChina, whose ambition is to dominate industries of the future, is pushing back. A column on Saturday in the Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper stated, \"The United States is again waving the club of tariffs after misjudging China's strength, capacity and will, further escalating trade friction between our two countries.\"\n\nThe piece was written under the pen name Zhong Sheng -- the \"voice of China\" -- a name used when the paper publishes comments on foreign affairs that are authoritative.\n\nRestraining China's ambitions and methods is a tricky task -- and there is concern that the Trump administration's effort is creating a new red scare, fueling discrimination against China and its citizens that could ultimately hurt the United States. As many as 30 Chinese professors have had their visas to the United States canceled in the past year, or been put on administrative review, according to Chinese academics and their American counterparts.\n\n\"We've got decades of painful negotiating with China ahead,\" said David Lampton, a China scholar at Stanford University. Mr. Lampton said a trade deal, if reached, would do little to resolve the bigger conflict. \"It's just a skirmish in an ongoing battle.\"\n\nChinese negotiators returned to Beijing over the weekend without a trade agreement and with even larger economic barriers between the two countries. The Trump administration raised tariffs on $200 billion in exports on Friday and said it would move ahead with the legal process of taxing another roughly $300 billion of products at the same 25 percent rate.\n\nThe two countries could yet come to an agreement that opens opportunities for businesses and rolls back the levies they have placed on each other. Both American and Chinese officials said on Friday that they would continue to talk and could meet in Beijing next month. Liu He, China's vice premier, called the failure to reach a deal \"just a small setback in the talks between two countries,\" while Mr. Trump, in a tweet, described the talks as \"candid and constructive.\"\n\nWhile a trade deal could calm some tensions and establish more good will between the two nations, it is unlikely to achieve many of the ambitious goals that the administration has set for itself. Mr. Trump's advisers, in particular the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, have been focused on what the administration calls China's practices of \"economic aggression.\"\n\nBut the administration has struggled to address the immensity of the problems in the text of a trade deal. People close to the talks say that the negotiators appear powerless to force any changes that aren't in China's interest.\n\nMr. Liu, who is leading China's team in the trade negotiations, hinted at that uphill battle in a video statement released by the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n\"Now both sides have reached consensus in many respects, but frankly there are also areas of disagreement,\" he said. \"We believe that these are major matters of principle, and any country has its own important principles -- we can't make concessions on matters of principle.\"\n\nDespite punishing tariffs already on nearly half of Chinese exports to the United States, Beijing is still resisting many of the most significant changes that the administration seeks. It has been reluctant to roll back subsidies for advanced manufacturing industries or to make public commitments to stop cybertheft.\n\nInstead, a trade deal between the two countries seems more likely to bring change around the margins -- tens of billions of dollars of soybean purchases, some tariffs lifted and changes to the text of Chinese laws or regulations that the country might ultimately disregard, particularly once another administration occupies the White House.\n\n\"This is a decades-long endeavor,\" said Robert Daly, the director of the Wilson Center's Kissinger Institute on China and the United States. \"This can't be waved away over cake at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nThe notion that the United States has one last shot to change China's behavior is held by an array of people on both sides of the political spectrum. But it is an aggressive notion of American power to upend a rival system that has delivered prosperity for its people and put China on course to be the world's largest economy.\n\nMany in China see the United States as a declining power bent on enforcing its will on a world that no longer cowers before its hegemonic might. The troubles in American democracy and the long economic slump after 2008 persuaded many in China that its instincts to chart its own course were correct. In the eyes of many Chinese, their country is simply reclaiming its historic status as a dominant regional power in Asia.\n\nIt has also projected power across Asia, Africa and elsewhere while the United States has, on many fronts, retreated from its post-World War II commitment to the global order. But it has done so with little application of military force, in sharp contrast to what many in China see as American militarism.\n\nMany in China have sought to avoid a trade conflict, which could have a larger impact on their economy than the United States'. But they have long thought the United States would have a difficult time accepting a true peer in economic, technology and military power, so consider the management of conflict with the United States to be an inevitable result of their own rise.\n\nWhile the Trump administration accused China of breaking a trade deal, China's resistance to the emerging terms stemmed from its belief that the United States was asking too much and offering too little in return. Many of the changes the United States seeks would limit what Chinese officials regard as a tried-and-true approach of using tens of billions of dollars from state-owned banks and government investment funds to turn previously small industries like car production or solar panel manufacturing into the largest industries of their kind in the world.\n\nAnd the Chinese view some of the Trump administration's demands as infringing on their sovereignty and giving America too much power over their economy -- including requiring it to codify changes through legislation in the National People's Congress. To the increasingly nationalistic public in China, the American requests are reminiscent of 19th century history of unequal treaties forced on the country by foreign powers.\n\nIn the United States, China's unwillingness to bow to America's demands is uniting lawmakers like the Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.\n\nThat is a significant shift from the prevailing view in the United States since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 that close economic engagement with China would produce an increasingly democratic country that would be closely tied to an international economic order founded mainly on Western liberal ideals.\n\nThat has not happened.\n\nChina has indeed grown in prosperity, leaping into the ranks of what the World Bank defines as upper-middle income countries. Its economy is now bigger than any other country except the United States. Its manufacturing sector is now bigger than those of the United States, Germany and South Korea combined.\n\nBut in the last five years, China has veered toward increasingly repressive authoritarianism at home and a rapid military buildup. The State Department estimates that Beijing has put 800,000 to two million Muslims in hastily built internment camps ringed with barbed wire in northwestern China. The Chinese government has built an archipelago of air bases on artificial islands in the South China Sea in between Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. And China now has the world's largest navy and has conducted military exercises as far away as East Africa and the Baltic Sea.\n\nOn the economic front, the competition is even fiercer. Trump administration officials warn that China is trying to dominate the global 5G infrastructure that will be the basis for future mobile communications and is competing to set other technological standards that will determine which global companies win.\n\nChina is extending low-cost loans and building infrastructure around the globe through its One Belt, One Road program, which critics warn is making poorer countries beholden to China. It is out-investing the United States in some high-tech industries, and is gaining dominance in certain segments, like mobile payment, new energy vehicles and areas of artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile American companies have long hankered for access to China's growing market, their position has begun to shift as they see China's practices and treatment of foreign companies. A survey released by the American Chamber of Commerce in China in February showed that the majority of its members favored retaining tariffs on Chinese goods while trade negotiations continued.\n\nChina's own experts say that the Beijing leadership has been caught off guard by the pace of change in American perceptions of Sino-American relations.\n\n\"Even if there is some kind of agreement between Xi and Trump, in the long run the strategic bilateral relationship is already in trouble,\" said Zhang Jian, a professor in the School of Government at Peking University. \"There is no coming back, even if there is a deal.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/12/us/12dc-tradewar-sub-2/merlin_153827598_526c0d28-e557-4511-a8da-a90f4aa0af0b-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4782070", "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 295291320}, {"uri": "1133500178", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-11", "time": "10:55:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-11T10:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/opinion/killing-the-pax-americana.html", "title": "Opinion | Killing the Pax Americana", "body": "O.K., they weren't supposed to start the trade war until I got back from vacation. And I really have too many kilometers to cover and hills to climb to weigh in on a regular basis or at great length. But since I'm currently sitting in an outdoor caf\u00e9 with my coffee and croissant, I thought I might take a few minutes to address two misconceptions that, I believe, are coloring discussion of the trade conflict.\n\nBy the way, I don't mean Trump's misconceptions. As far as I can tell, he isn't getting a single thing about trade policy right. He doesn't know how tariffs work, or who pays them. He doesn't understand what bilateral trade imbalances mean, or what causes them. He has a zero-sum view of trade that flies in the face of everything we've learned over the past two centuries. And to the (small) extent that he is making any coherent demands on China, they're demands China can't/won't meet.\n\nBut Trump's critics, while vastly more accurate than he is, also, I think, get a few things wrong, or at least overstate some risks while understating others. On one side, the short-run costs of trade war tend to be overstated. On the other, the long-term consequences of what's happening are bigger than most people seem to realize.\n\nIn the short run, a tariff is a tax. Period. The macroeconomic consequences of a tariff should therefore be seen as comparable to the macroeconomic consequences of any tax increase. True, this tax increase is more regressive than, say, a tax on high incomes, or a wealth tax. This means that it falls on people who will be forced to cut their spending, and is therefore likely to have a bigger negative bang per buck than the positive bang for buck from the 2017 tax cut. But we're still talking, at least so far, about a tax hike that is only a fraction of a percent of GDP.\n\nThis means that it's hard to justify claims that the trade war, at least what's currently in the pipeline, will cause a global recession.\n\nIf the trade war expands not just to all imports from China but to imports from Europe and other parts of the world, we could get this up to a contractionary fiscal policy of a couple of points of GDP; $200 billion here, $200 billion there, and soon you're talking about real money. And that certainly could happen: Trump imagines that he's winning, and might well move on from China to European cars and so on. But we're not there yet.\n\nBut doesn't the prospect of foreign retaliation change the picture? Actually, what foreign retaliation does is prevent tariffs from being less bad than an ordinary tax increase. When a large country like the U.S. imposes tariffs, one effect - if we don't face foreign retaliation - is a rise in the price of U.S. exports, either though a rise in the dollar or by drawing resources away from export to import-competing sectors. This price rise is, other things equal, a gain for America (although not for export-oriented sectors like agriculture.) And this \"terms of trade\" effect can mitigate or even reverse the overall losses as tariffs distort the economy.\n\nIf (when) foreigners retaliate, however, the terms of trade effect goes away, and we're back to tariffs just being a tax on domestic consumers.\n\nMaybe the larger point here is that there tends to be a certain amount of mysticism about trade policy, because the fact that it's global and touches on one of the most famous insights in economics, the theory of comparative advantage, gives it an amount of mind space somewhat disproportionate to its actual economic importance. Yes, trade policy is important; but in terms of the strict economics it's not more important than health policy, or fiscal policy, or policy in general.\n\nI say this, by the way, as someone whose career as a professional economist was based mainly on research into international trade and finance. In general, people who actually work on these issues tend to assign them less importance than those who haven't studied them closely.\n\nAll of this, however, is only about the strict economics of a trade war, which may be the least important aspect of what's happening.\n\nFor trade policy isn't just about economics. It's also about democracy and peace.\n\nThis is obvious and explicit in Europe, where the origins of the European Union lie in the Coal and Steel Community of the early 1950s - an agreement whose economic benefits, while real, were in a way incidental to its real purpose, preventing any future wars between France and Germany. And membership of the E.U. has always been contingent on democratization - which is, by the way, why the E.U.'s limp reaction to the de facto collapse of democracy in Hungary and, it appears, Poland represents such moral failure.\n\nIt's more implicit in the case of the United States. But the historical record is pretty clear: the postwar trading system grew out of the vision of Cordell Hull, FDR's Secretary of State, who saw commercial links between nations as a way to promote peace. That system, with its multilateral agreements and rules to limit unilateral action, was from the beginning a crucial piece of the Pax Americana. It was as integral to the postwar order as the IMF, which was supposed to provide a safety net for nations having balance of payments trouble, or for that matter NATO.\n\nAnd Trump's trade war should correspondingly be seen as part and parcel of his embrace of foreign dictators, lack of respect for our allies, and evident contempt for democracy, at home as well as abroad.\n\nBut wait, you say: China is neither an ally nor a democracy, and it is in many ways a bad actor in world trade. Isn't there a reasonable case for confronting China over its economic practices?\n\nYes, there is - or there would be if the tariffs on Chinese products were an isolated story, or better yet if Trump were assembling an alliance of nations to confront objectionable Chinese policies. But in fact Trump has been waging trade war against almost everyone, although at lower intensity. When you're imposing tariffs on imports of Canadian steel, on the ludicrous pretense that they endanger national security, and are threatening to do the same to German autos, you're not building a strategic coalition to deal with a misbehaving China.\n\nWhat you're doing, instead, is tearing down what's left of the Pax Americana.\n\nWasn't this inevitable in any case? I don't think so. True, U.S. economic dominance has been eroding over time, not because we're getting poorer, but because the rest of the world is getting richer. But there was reason to hope that a relatively peaceable international order could be sustained by an alliance of democratic powers. In fact, until a few years ago it seemed to me that we were seeing exactly that taking place for the world trading system, which was transitioning from largely benign U.S. hegemony to a comparably benign co-dominion by the U.S. and the E.U.\n\nAt this point, however, things look a lot bleaker. It's not just Trump. And it's not even just Trump plus Brexit. The Europeans are also turning out to be a big disappointment. As I said, if they can't even deal with the likes of Viktor Orban within their own community, they're definitely not up to providing the kind of leadership the world needs.\n\nBut where the Europeans are weak, Trump is malign. He's working actively to make the world a more dangerous, less democratic place, with trade war just one manifestation of that drive. And the eventual negative consequences for America and the world will be much bigger than anything we can capture with economic modeling of the effects of tariffs.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
