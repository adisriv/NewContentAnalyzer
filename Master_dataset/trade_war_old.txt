Last Thursday, the Agriculture Department announced that it would provide up to $16 billion in farm aid, to be financed, the president has said, using the \"massive Tariffs being paid to the United States for allowing China, and others, to do business with us.\"\n\nMr. Trump failed to mention who pays those \"massive Tariffs.\" (Hint: Americans.) But he has never been one to let details get in the way of a good plotline.\n\nThe president's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has been more frank about the United States-China showdown. \"Both sides will suffer,\" he said after trade talks with China broke down earlier this month. But the \"possible improvement in trade and exports and open markets\" make the suffering \"worthwhile,\" he added. \"You've got to do what you got to do.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers, usually a free-trade-loving bunch, have taken up the cause as well. Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania allowed that tariffs are \"absolutely painful and dislocating,\" but he reasoned that, someday, Americans might look back and say they were \"worth the price.\"\n\nAnd when it comes to wrapping tariffs in the flag, no one can touch Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. Yes, the trade war will require \"some sacrifices on the part of Americans,\" he said, but the costs \"will be pretty minimal\" compared with those paid by American troops serving overseas and our \"fallen heroes.\"\n\nGive Mr. Cotton debate points: Few would dispute that being killed in action is more of a hardship than paying a little extra for spark plugs or baseball mitts or live eels.\n\nFewer still would make such a tasteless comparison.\n\nPrevious presidents have appealed to Americans' patriotism in wartime. In peacetime, President Kennedy's 1961 inaugural entreaty -- \"Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.\" -- inspired an entire generation.\n\nThe Trumpian call to duty, however, is a particularly bold -- even counterintuitive -- choice for a president whose core message has always been that he can save anxious Americans from having to make tough choices, to adapt to economic changes or to face scary cultural shifts. His pledge to Make America Great Again has never been about helping move the nation into the future, but about easing it back into a more comforting past. In his capacity as Strong Leader, he has vowed to take care of everything, and it is all going to be \"so easy.\"\n\nThere is, in fact, no problem so big or so complex that Mr. Trump has not boasted of his ability to fix it quickly and painlessly. Repealing and replacing Obamacare with a better, cheaper system? Easy. Returning domestic manufacturing to its heyday? Easy. Lowering gas prices? Ending the drug problem? Dealing with China? Easy, easy and easy. Restoring cultural and economic security by erecting a big, beautiful border wall that Mexico will pay for? Piece. Of. Cake.\n\nOf all Mr. Trump's grandiose claims, his pledge to restore lost manufacturing jobs remains among the most heartbreaking. \"Don't move. Don't sell your houses,\" he soothed voters in the Rust Belt town of Youngstown, Ohio, in 2017. \"They're all coming back,\" he promised of the jobs and prosperity.\n\nThese dreams have not come to pass.\n\nMr. Trump's rosy reassurances that trade wars \"are good, and easy to win\" have proved equally hollow. Farmers are not the only ones suffering. Manufacturers are paying higher prices. The instability is disrupting markets. Small wonder the latest Quinnipiac poll shows only 39 percent of Americans approve of the president's trade policies.\n\nIt's always possible that the president will confound the naysayers and emerge from what he has called his \"little squabble with China\" with some big-picture successes. Alternatively, this folly could wind up wreaking global havoc well beyond the economic sphere.\n\nEither way, Team Trump recognizes the immediate political potential of its new messaging. The president's gift for waging culture war has served him well in keeping his fans riled up and his critics off-kilter. By turning trade into a matter of national pride -- a clash of civilizations, if you will -- he's reminding supporters that he is fighting for them against both foreign competitors and \"globalists\" here at home. This can help distract from whatever economic pain they're experiencing. At least for now.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Trump has no intention of abandoning his penchant for making impossible promises. At a rally in Montoursville, Pa., last week, he went on and on about how he had saved American industry, saying, \"Remember the old days, we actually made our own product.\" The president lamented the tens of thousands of factories that have been shuttered post-Nafta, before proclaiming triumphantly, \"They're all coming back!\"\n\nAre they, Mr. President?\n\nRelatedTrump Gives Farmers $16 Billion in Aid Amid Prolonged China Trade WarMay 23, 2019Why the U.S.-China Trade War Could Be Long and Painful: No OfframpsMay 14, 2019Tariffs Trim a Factory's Profit, but Loyalty to Trump EnduresJuly 23, 2018\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

(Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News) By Henry Olsen Henry Olsen Columnist focusing on politics, populism, and American conservative thought Columnist May 24 at 3:50 PM\n\nPresident Trump announced Thursday that he would extend $16 billion in aid to farmers harmed by his trade conflict with China. The politics of that move are clear, but it sends yet another message that farmers count while the rest of us don't. That special status isn't going to hold if the trade war with China persists.\n\nFarmers are already one of the most subsidized and protected groups in the United States. According to Vince Smith, a noted agricultural economist and director of the American Enterprise Institute's agricultural studies program, soybean farmers are already eligible for government aid under three separate programs. They can purchase subsidized crop insurance to protect them against crop losses, and they participate in government programs that protect them against declines in farm revenue and in the price of soybeans. Trump's new aid comes on top of that.\n\nIt's not going to take long for others hurt by Chinese tariffs and retaliatory measures to ask for their fair share. Many manufacturers depend on Chinese steel imports to make their products. They don't have government subsidized insurance to protect them when their sales drop. They will rightly ask why they should have to bear the cost of a trade war while soybean farmers don't. What will Trump and Congress say to them?\n\nRetail stores such as Walmart also have reason to complain. Retailers whose business models depend on selling relatively inexpensive imports from China will have to raise their prices if their imports are subjected to tariffs. The alternative is to cut profits, reduce wages or fire workers. Retailers don't have three standing government programs to protect them in the face of business downturns. Why should retailers suffer while soybean farmers cash checks that retailers' taxes pay for?\n\nConsumers could also get in line for aid. The Trade Partnership estimates the average household will pay an extra $767 next year because of the new tariffs on Chinese imports. That amount is equal to or greater than the size of the tax cut they received from Trump's signature tax bill. Will working-class families whose budgets are stretched to cover ordinary expenses get an extra $500 or $1,000 rebate to cover their added costs?\n\nThe cries for more government aid will grow louder the longer the trade war lasts. Now that Trump has set a precedent that Americans shouldn't have to sacrifice during the conflict, it will be politically hard for him to resist calls for potentially hundreds of billions in extra spending.\n\nThat's just not tenable. We are already on track to borrow more than $1 trillion just to cover normal government spending. Budget negotiations underway are likely to result in more spending hikes, which mean more borrowing. Congress and Trump will be caught between legitimate political demands for fair treatment and budgetary realities. Something will have to give.\n\nThe something that should give is the special aid to farmers. They won't be made completely whole, but then again, neither will anyone else. Their existing government programs will help them avoid the worst damage from the conflict. Cutting or eliminating aid to the farmers covered by the existing programs will send a message that the trade conflict is in the national interest, and everyone needs to sacrifice something so we all will be better off in the long run.\n\nTrump is absolutely right to have started this conflict. China has been manipulating trade rules for decades, putting millions of Americans out of work and placing China on a path to surpass the United States as a global power by mid-century. But wars, whether fought with guns or with tariffs, cost money and demand sacrifice. In this war, everyone has to pitch in and do their part -- including soybean farmers.\n\nJennifer Rubin: How much pain is Trump going to inflict on those who elected him?\n\nArt Cullen: Farms are suffering from climate change and Trump's trade war.

One consequence is that his economic policy is guided less by the invisible hand of the free market than the heavy hand of the central government.\n\nThe president continued his pattern of picking winners and losers on Thursday afternoon when he unveiled a $16 billion bailout to help farmers offset losses from the trade war he started, and which he continues to escalate, with China. This is on top of the $12 billion in emergency cash he made available last July.\n\nThe substance of Trump's announcement at the White House, in which he was flanked by more than a dozen farmers, was entirely overshadowed by his own theatrics. Angry that Speaker Nancy Pelosi claimed he threw a \"temper tantrum,\" the president told reporters: \"I'm an extremely stable genius, okay?\" Standing in front of the press corps, Trump asked five of his aides to tell everyone how \"very calm\" he had been when he walked out of a meeting the day before. \"You were very calm,\" replied Larry Kudlow, the president's top economic adviser.\n\nThe new bailout Trump introduced is significant and merits scrutiny. Make no mistake, these are government handouts. And few conservatives who purport to support free markets are objecting.\n\nThe politics are a no-brainer. Trump cannot win reelection without the farm belt. He narrowly prevailed in 2016 because of overwhelming strength in rural areas that depend on agriculture. Indeed, the Chinese have targeted farmers to cause political pain for the president so that he'll cave in negotiations. As soon as Trump slapped tariffs of 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports, Beijing retaliated with import taxes on U.S. agricultural commodities such as soybeans, which tend to be grown in places the president is depending on in 2020.\n\nTrump began his 47-minute appearance in the Roosevelt Room by noting that farmers have supported him. He said it was a \"great honor to be here with ... people that have been with me from the beginning.\" \"They're patriots. They stood up and they were with me,\" the president said. \"I'm very honored to have done this for you.\"\n\nThe long riff that followed underscored the degree to which Trump sees the presidency as transactional. He seems to think he deserves credit for making the government cut checks to save farmers after pursuing policies that have pushed them toward insolvency. Never mind that there would be no need for this bailout if he hadn't picked a fight with not just China but also allies like Mexico, Canada and Europe. It's been 15 months now since Trump declared that \"trade wars are good, and easy to win.\" He tweeted that the morning after announcing a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum.\n\nIn his remarks, Trump suggested that this trade war could drag on for a very long time. \"I remain hopeful that, at some point, we'll probably get together with China,\" he said. \"If it happens, great. If it doesn't happen, that's fine. That's absolutely fine.\"\n\nTrump proceeded to tout initiatives he's taken to help corn growers. He noted that he directed the EPA to make it easier to sell more ethanol in vehicle fuel, lifting summertime fueling restrictions on E15 gasoline, which means it contains as much as 15 percent ethanol. Iowa is the nation's top producer of both ethanol and corn. Most economists can explain to you why this is shortsighted economic policy, not to mention deleterious for the environment. \"The people in Iowa, and lots of other places, are very happy,\" he declared yesterday afternoon. \"I made a promise during the campaign that I was going to do it. I don't know if it had an impact, but I won Iowa by a lot.\"\n\n-- Not everyone is getting government handouts. The brewers, for instance, haven't received any bailout. America's beer industry yesterday blamed the Trump tariffs for the loss of 40,000 jobs. Metal tariffs imposed by Trump have boosted the cost of aluminum cans, leading to declines in investment, a new report by two trade groups showed, per Bloomberg News.\n\n-- Bigger picture, Trump has pursued something that at times feels akin to a 1950s-style national industrial policy. He's tried to revive steelmakers and domestic manufacturers with tariffs. He's vetoed foreign investments. He's publicly pressuring the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. He has used the bully pulpit of the presidency to attack individual companies, and even corporate executives, by name. Among other things, Trump went after Nordstrom's for dropping his daughter Ivanka's clothing line.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin disclosed during congressional testimony on Wednesday that he's personally been haggling with corporate executives about prices. He said he spoke with the chief financial officer of Walmart after the company warned that customers will need to pay more for furniture and other goods because of the Trump tariffs. To put it mildly, this has not historically been the role of the treasury secretary. At least in America.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has been given immense power over whether to grant waivers to exempt companies from tariffs. This gives government the ability to favor some companies and industries and punish others.\n\n-- It's Economics 101: Central planning like this has never worked in the long run because it distorts incentives, and no bureaucrat setting prices in Washington can outsmart markets. Cliometricians can debate until the cows come home, but the free market -- as much as anything else -- is why we won the Cold War. The Soviets just couldn't keep up.\n\n\"Trump's snap decision to send billions of dollars in new aid to farmers could be bad for the farm economy and the federal budget,\" Politico food and agriculture reporter Catherine Boudreau reports. \"Many farmers are still deciding what to plant this spring and could be swayed toward crops that receive higher payouts from the aid package, such as soybeans. That would add to already record supplies and further depress prices that have been falling for five years. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who weeks earlier denied the White House was discussing another round of aid so soon after a $12 billion bailout last year, suddenly interrupted a trip to South Korea to announce a second program.\n\n\"Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, told reporters Wednesday that the White House should have been more cautious about the timing of the announcement because farmers are still planting. 'We want farmers to make decisions on how many acres of corn and soybeans to plant based on the market and not something the government's doing,' he said. ... Rainfall in the Midwest has delayed planting, so many farmers can still switch up their crops. Even the prospect of another round of trade assistance could encourage them to plant more soybeans.\"\n\n-- \"The new relief plan aims to avoid problems that arose in the first aid package, when soybeans received what many believed was a disproportionate amount of the money, while corn received only a penny a bushel. Other producers were shut out entirely from relief payments,\" Laura Reiley, Colby Itkowitz and Annie Gowen report. \"The bulk of the payments will be set aside for row crops such as alfalfa, wheat and oats, which will be paid at a single rate according to the number of acres planted in each county. More niche crops, including tree nuts, sweet cherries, cranberries and grapes, will also be eligible for relief, depending on tariff impacts. Dairy and pork producers also stand to receive relief under the system. Distributing relief funds by-county, and not by commodity, will hopefully discourage farmers from planting crops that would be more lucrative in aid money.\"\n\n-- But the Trump bailouts are often not going to the farmers who need them the most. Jeff Stein reported last November about some of the people who got money from the first, $12 billion round of bailouts: \"Scott Yocom is a 48-year-old architect who lives in Manhattan, works at an office building near Times Square, and has been recently consumed with designing a new central terminal at LaGuardia Airport in Queens. But late last month, Yocom received a government check worth about $3,300, a payment that came courtesy of a Trump administration program aimed at helping farmers hurt by the U.S.-China trade war. Yocom said he spends two weeks a year on his family farm in Ohio, but as a part-owner he was eligible for the bailout funds. Yocom was one of at least 1,100 residents of the 50 largest U.S. cities who has received bailout funds from the Agriculture Department, according to USDA data.\"\n\nConsider this story published last week by the New York Daily News: \"The Trump administration has forked over more than $62 million -- taxpayer cash that was supposed to be earmarked for struggling American farmers -- to a massive meatpacking company owned by a couple of corrupt Brazilian brothers. The Department of Agriculture cut a contract in January to purchase $22.3 million worth of pork from plants operated by JBS USA, a Colorado-based subsidiary of Brazil's JBS SA, which ranks as the largest meatpacker in the world. ... Previously undisclosed purchase reports ... reveal the administration has since issued at least two more bailouts to JBS, even as Trump's own Justice Department began investigating the meatpacker, whose owners are Joesley and Wesley Batista -- two wealthy brothers who have confessed to bribing hundreds of top officials in Brazil. Both brothers have spent time in jail over the sweeping corruption scandal.\"\n\n-- Despite these and many other problems so far, most conservatives on Capitol Hill were more muted in their response to the second round of agriculture bailouts than the first. It's another proof point of the degree to which Trump's takeover of the GOP has made the party more protectionist, even mercantilist, in its outlook. \"Last year, some Republican senators were incensed by such a move, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) compared it to 'golden crutches' aimed at 'making it 1929 again' and then Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) questioned why 'there isn't an outright revolt in Congress right now,'\" Jackie Alemany notes this morning. \"But Corker retired and Sasse is running for reelection, plus other Republican senators view the decision to go after China as worthwhile even if it means an economic gut punch for farmers and other industries in the interim.\" Sasse did not release a statement yesterday.\n\nFOLLOW THE MONEY:\n\n-- Trump is breaking with norms and pushing military decision-makers who are supposed to be immune to political considerations to give a massive contract to a specific firm. This is the most jaw-dropping story you'll read today:\n\n\"Trump has personally and repeatedly urged the head of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to award a border wall contract to a North Dakota construction firm whose top executive is a GOP donor and frequent guest on Fox News,\" Nick Miroff and Josh Dawsey report. \"In phone calls, White House meetings and conversations aboard Air Force One during the past several months, Trump has aggressively pushed Fisher Industries to Department of Homeland Security leaders and Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, the commanding general of the Army Corps.\n\n\"The push for a specific company has alarmed military commanders and DHS officials. Semonite was summoned to the White House again Thursday, after the president's aides told Pentagon officials -- including Gen. Mark Milley, the Army's chief of staff -- that the president wanted to discuss the border barrier. ... Trump immediately brought up Fisher, a company that sued the U.S. government last month after the Army Corps did not accept its bid to install barriers along the southern border, a contract potentially worth billions of dollars. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, has joined in the campaign for Fisher Industries, along with Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), an ardent promoter of the company and the recipient of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Fisher and his family members.\n\n\"Trump's repeated attempts to influence the Army Corps' contracting decisions show the degree to which the president is willing to insert himself into what is normally a staid legal and regulatory process designed to protect the U.S. government from accusations of favoritism. ... But Trump's personal intervention risks the perception of improper influence on decades-old procurement rules that require government agencies to seek competitive bids, free of political interference.\n\n\"Fisher Industries was one of the six companies that built border wall prototypes outside San Diego in 2017, but the company's concrete design did not afford the see-through visibility that DHS officials wanted. ... When Fisher began promoting a steel version of the barrier that he said could be installed faster and cheaper, the Army Corps said the design did not meet its requirements and lacked regulatory approvals. ... DHS officials also told the Army Corps in March that Fisher's work on a barrier project in San Diego came in late and over budget. ... Officials from the Army Corps and DHS then met with Kushner several times to explain why Fisher wasn't the best deal. Kushner was intimately interested in ... why other companies were being chosen over Fisher ... Trump repeatedly told advisers that Fisher should be the company, administration officials said.\"\n\n-- Programming note: To celebrate Memorial Day, we'll be off on Monday. Talk to you Tuesday.

Conservative lawmakers ... have insisted to friends in the administration that declassifying these documents will help Trump protect his presidency and further distance himself from any political fallout from the Russia investigation, according to multiple people involved in those discussions.

Renae Merle and Rosalind S. Helderman report: \"As the bank rushed through the high-risk loans, Calk gave Manafort a list ranking the senior administrative jobs he wanted, starting with treasury secretary, the indictment alleges. Calk ultimately was interviewed as a candidate for undersecretary of the Army but did not get the job, prosecutors said. Calk, 54, pleaded not guilty in a Manhattan federal court Thursday afternoon and was released on a $5 million personal recognizance bond. The judge ordered him to give up his passport, firearms and not to talk to any potential witness in his case. Calk faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted of the charge of financial institution bribery. He is on a leave of absence from Federal Savings Bank of Chicago, which is privately held.\"\n\n-- Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, replied \"On it!\" when Manafort emailed to ask for help getting Calk a job.

The U.S. government, though, sought to distinguish the anti-secrecy advocate from a reporter. 'Julian Assange is no journalist,' said John Demers, the assistant attorney general for national security. He said Assange had engaged in 'explicit solicitation of classified information.' Press freedom advocates said the distinction being drawn by prosecutors offers little protection for journalists.

Susan Berger and Toluse Olorunnipa: \"Dershowitz -- a Harvard law professor who has regularly gone on television to declare Trump's innocence of obstruction of justice charges -- said he wrote a letter to the White House requesting the pardon. Dershowitz's letter, which was reviewed by the White House Counsel's Office, played a major role in getting Trump and his legal advisers on board, according to Black, a Canadian billionaire and former Trump business partner who wrote a glowing book about the president last year. ... Black did not apply for the pardon through official Justice Department channels, which largely have gone unused as Trump has issued pardons to people who have praised or supported him. ... He has ... granted clemency to several people after learning of their cases on Fox News. On the same day he pardoned Black, he granted clemency to Patrick J.

Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has placed such a hold on a planned sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia, over concerns that the weapons may be used against civilian targets in war-torn Yemen. Such holds are common -- and the prospect that Trump may try to blow through several objections to such arms sales has alarmed lawmakers, who are anxious to protect their authority to have a say on the executive branch's ability to export lethal weaponry to foreign actors.\"\n\n-- The fight over Trump's financial records could land at the Supreme Court as the 2020 race peaks.

The brief ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit means the accounting firm will not give a House committee the president's business records while the case is pending. ... The decision Thursday by a three-judge panel puts that agreement in effect and calls for oral argument July 12. The timeline allows the case to move swiftly by court standards and could set up a decision from the Supreme Court that could land in the thick of the 2020 presidential campaign. If the appeals court in Washington -- and perhaps the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York, where a second similar case may be filed -- rules within a matter of weeks rather than months, the justices might have to take up procedural motions this summer.\"\n\n-- Another judge sounded skeptical of the House lawsuit aiming to block Trump from diverting money appropriated for other purposes to pay for his border wall. DOJ argues that Congress cannot sue to enforce its power of the purse. Spencer S. Hsu reports: \"Over nearly three hours of arguments, U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden of the District said there were few cases to guide how courts should rule on a major test of the constitutional separation of powers, and pressed House general counsel Douglas Letter to point to historical precedent allowing one chamber of Congress to sue the president to settle political differences. Whether the House has legal standing to sue is 'problematic' and a 'significant issue in this case,' said McFadden, citing the bedrock legal requirement that a party prove it is being harmed and show that only a court can address it. 'Courts are not there to adjudicate just interesting constitutional or political questions between the branches,' he added later.\"\n\nTRUMP VS. PELOSI:\n\n-- Trump and Pelosi traded fresh insults. The president called the House speaker \"crazy Nancy,\" while the speaker suggested his White House aides and family should consider staging an intervention \"for the good of the country.\" Rachael Bade, John Wagner and Anne Gearan report: \"The fight quickly escalated as Pelosi (D-Calif.) taunted Trump at her Capitol Hill news conference Thursday morning, a move intentionally aimed at portraying the president as erratic and upsetting him, according to an individual familiar with Pelosi's thinking. ... Furious with her scornful comments, Trump, 72, [impugned] the 79-year-old Pelosi's mental clarity -- 'she's lost it' -- and [suggested] the North American trade deal was too complicated for her to understand.\"\n\n-- Altered videos of Pelosi, intended to make her appear drunk, are quickly spreading across the Internet. Drew Harwell reports: \"The video of Pelosi's onstage speech Wednesday at a Center for American Progress event, in which she said Trump's refusal to cooperate with congressional investigations was tantamount to a 'coverup,' was subtly edited to make her voice sound garbled and warped. It was then circulated widely across Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. One version, posted by the conservative Facebook page Politics WatchDog, had been viewed more than 2 million times by Thursday night, been shared more than 45,000 times, and garnered 23,000 comments with users calling her 'drunk' and 'a babbling mess.' ... On Thursday night, Trump tweeted a separate video of Pelosi -- a selectively edited supercut, taken from Fox News, focused on moments where she briefly paused or stumbled -- that he claimed showed her stammering through a news conference.\"\n\n-- Pelosi declined to engage with Kellyanne Conway after the White House counselor took aim at her wealth. Felicia Sonmez reports: \"'I'm not going to talk about her,' Pelosi told reporters at her weekly news conference ... Conway asked Pelosi whether she had a response for the president after he stormed out of the room [on Wednesday]. ... Pelosi replied that she would respond directly to the president, not staff ... Conway -- who lives in a $7.7 million mansion in Northwest Washington -- then went on to take aim at Pelosi's personal wealth. 'Let's face it. She's the sixth-most-rich member of Congress. She treats everybody like they're her staff.' ... Roll Call listed Pelosi as the 30th wealthiest member of the House or the Senate during the last Congress, with an estimated net worth of $16 million.\"\n\nIMPEACHMENT WATCH:\n\n-- The speaker has tamped down impeachment talk among most of her rank and file, at least for now. And she may have bought herself a little more time with Congress heading into a recess. Politico's Heather Caygle and Sarah Ferris capture the state of play: \"The California Democrat sent lawmakers out the door Thursday for a 10-day Memorial Day break after tamping down swelling demands from House Democrats to launch impeachment proceedings against [Trump] ... After working to mollify the party's restive left flank this week by pointing to a pair of legal victories in their oversight battle with Trump, Democrats were ushered into the recess with new talking points from the caucus' messaging arm that were conspicuously silent on impeachment.\"\n\n-- The last time a president was threatened with impeachment, he didn't talk about it. Trump can't help but do the exact opposite. The New York Times's Peter Baker reports: \"Where Bill Clinton tried to appear above the mud fight, leaving it to aides and allies to wage the battle for him, Mr. Trump is determined to get down into the mud himself and wrestle with his enemies at every turn. Some advisers worry that the president is giving oxygen to a fire that otherwise might burn out or at least be left to crackle in the background. ... It is safe to say that there seems to be little prospect for major legislation beyond simply keeping the government open. And even that might prove problematic. 'President Trump is quite willing to sacrifice his agenda to defend himself,' said former Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who was the Democratic leader during Mr. Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999. 'He believes that no one can do that as effectively as he can, and, for him, that takes priority over any legislative issue.'\"\n\n-- Former Republican congressman Tom Coleman (Mo.) said both Trump and Vice President Pence are illegitimate. \"Impeach them,\" Coleman writes in an op-ed for today's Kansas City Star: \"The political calculus not to pursue impeachment is understandable. Current polls show a majority of voters do not favor it. But critical times require exceptional leadership. Lawmakers of both parties should not blindly follow the polls but instead follow the evidence and their conscience. Politics should not rule the day. Partisan politics is what got us to this dangerous place -- so dangerous, I believe, that the survival of our democracy is at risk. ... If this process leads to impeaching Trump in the House of Representatives and also results in convicting him in the Senate, his illegitimacy would survive through Vice President Mike Pence's succession to the presidency. Because the misdeeds were conducted to assure the entire Trump-Pence ticket was elected, both former candidates -- Pence as well as Trump -- have been disgraced and discredited.\"\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Trump is mulling the Pentagon's request to send more forces to the Middle East, acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan said. Paul Sonne and Missy Ryan report: \"The proposal from U.S. Central Command, which oversees the Middle East, comes as the military seeks to address what officials have described as a spike in threats against U.S. forces, detected by U.S. intelligence streams, from Iran and its proxy groups. ... The meeting -- which Shanahan said would involve updating the president on the security situation in Iran -- won't necessarily end in a decision. Before the meeting, Trump said he didn't think it would be necessary to send more troops to the region. 'But if we need it, we'll be there in whatever numbers we need,' he said at the White House. Shanahan dismissed reports that the United States was preparing to send as many as 5,000 or 10,000 more forces to the region. 'There is no 10,000 and there is no 5,000,' Shanahan said.\"\n\n-- Trump will visit a Japan this weekend that's been hit hard by his trade war with China. Simon Denyer and Akiko Kashiwagi report: \"In Japan there is considerable support for Trump's tough line on China, but that's mixed with concern about the impact that the trade war and China's economic slowdown is already having on Japanese exports and factory output. There are also concerns that Japan will be next in the president's trade crosshairs ... In Seoul, the won fell sharply this week and has now depreciated by nearly 5 percent against the dollar in a month, pushed down in large part by the slowdown in China, the fall in its currency, the renminbi, and the impact of the trade war. Both countries also find themselves caught in the middle of the Huawei dispute ... \"\n\n-- The U.S. military is being blamed for contaminating the environment in Okinawa with a carcinogenic chemical that's been found in the rivers around an American air base and in the bloodstream of local residents. Simon Denyer and Akiko Kashiwagi report: \"The controversy is inflaming an already sensitive situation for the U.S. military in Okinawa ... a study by two Kyoto University professors found high concentrations of a chemical called perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in rivers passing through and around the Kadena Air Base and the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. PFOS is a chemical within the PFAS family, and was used by the U.S. military as an ingredient in firefighting foam for five decades until 2015, along with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).\"\n\n-- North Korea has been testing more ballistic missiles but Trump still won't invoke the B-word. Simon Denyer reports: \"The U.S. president is clearly trying to boast about what he considers an important foreign policy success, and minimize the problems that have emerged since the collapse of his summit with Kim Jong Un in Hanoi in February.\"\n\n-- Brazil's highest court voted to extend anti-discrimination protections to LGBT people amid a spike in attacks against them since President Jair Bolsonaro began his right-wing campaign in 2018. Marina Lopes reports: \"A majority of the 11-member Supreme Federal Court voted to find it unconstitutional to exclude sexual orientation and gender from Brazil's anti-discrimination law.\"\n\n-- A prominent French journalist was summoned for questioning by police over her reports on corruption at the highest levels of Emmanuel Macron's government. Ariane Chemin, a reporter for Le Monde, first broke news in 2018 about what has become known as the \"Benalla affair,\" a scandal that has fueled allegations of a coverup within Macron's palace. (James McAuley)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Barack Obama's silence on the 2020 race has sparked speculation he could be biding his time to have major sway if Democrats fail to rally around a nominee. The Atlantic's Edward-Isaac Dovere reports: \"Obama remains firm that he won't endorse soon, while aides are stressing that he might get involved later in the process -- presumably, the thinking goes, to stop a candidate he sees as too divisive or likely to lose from becoming the nominee. (This hasn't been specified, but most assume it would be to stop Bernie Sanders.) Obama and his aides have carefully guarded when and how to deploy him; some have even theorized he could be called on to broker who the 2020 nominee is, if the primaries finish without a clear winner and Democrats face a contested convention.\"\n\nThe uncertain release date of Obama's memoir could affect the dynamics of the Democratic primaries: \"The writing has been going more slowly than he'd expected, and according to several people who have spoken with him, the 44th president is feeling competitive with his wife, whose own book, Becoming, was the biggest release of 2018 and is on track to be the best-selling memoir in history. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, like others in this story, these sources note he'll occasionally point out in conversation that he's writing this book himself, while Michelle used a ghostwriter. ... The untitled memoir, which will reportedly begin with his 2004 Democratic National Convention speech and cover his two terms in the White House, won't be released in 2019, as his publisher, Penguin Random House, had predicted just a few months ago.\"\n\n-- Pete Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan as a Navy Reserve intelligence officer, said it's \"disgusting\" that Trump is considering pardons for U.S. soldiers accused of war crimes. The Democratic presidential candidate warned that such pardons could harm the reputation of the U.S. military and its justice system. \"If the president blows a hole in that, he is blowing a hole in the military, and he is putting troops lives at risk.\" He added that during his military service, \"the flag on my shoulder represented a country that kept its word. ... If we lose that, nothing will keep us safe.\" (John Wagner)\n\n-- Buttigieg also said that NFL players protesting racial inequality by kneeling during the national anthem are \"exercising a right that I had put my life on the line to defend.\" \"The point of defending free speech is not that you expect to be perfectly aligned with every speech act that is protected,\" he said in an interview with my colleague Robert Costa. \"And when that same flag was on my shoulder, I didn't think of the flag as something that itself as an image was sacred; I thought of it as something that was sacred because of what it represented. One of the very things it represented is the freedom of speech, and that's one of the reasons I served.\" (Jacob Bogage)\n\n-- Self-help author Marianne Williamson is virtually guaranteed a spot in the first Democratic debates after meeting both the polling and donor requirements to qualify. A third poll showed Williamson at 1 percent, and her campaign previously said it has received contributions from more than 65,000 donors. (Politico)\n\n-- Nearly half of Democrats say the ideal president would be someone \"in their 50s,\" according to a new Pew Research Center poll: \"Two of the Democratic Party's best-known candidates, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, are in their 70s, yet only 3% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say this is the best age range for a president. And just 6% say it would be ideal for a president to be in their 30s. ... [M]ost who identify as or lean Democratic say it would not have much effect on their enthusiasm if the party's presidential nominee were white, a person of color, or gay, lesbian or bisexual. However, nearly a third of all Democrats (31%) - including 45% of Democratic women ages 18 to 49 - say they would be more enthusiastic if the party's nominee were a woman.\"\n\n-- \"What Reparations for Slavery Might Look Like in 2019,\" by the New York Times's Patricia Cohen: \"Who would be paid? How much? Where would the money come from? ... William A. Darity Jr., an economist at Duke University and a leading scholar on reparations, suggests two qualifying conditions: having at least one ancestor who was enslaved in the United States, and having identified oneself as African-American on a legal document for at least a decade before the approval of any reparations. ... Attaching a dollar figure to a program of reparations resembles a 'Wheel of Fortune' spin, with amounts ranging from the piddling ($71.08 per recipient under Forman's plan) to the astronomical ($17 trillion in total).\"\n\n-- As liberal groups warn of the dire consequences of recent abortion ban bills, the Democratic Governors Association is planning to back two Democratic candidates who oppose abortion rights. HuffPost's Kevin Robillard and Amanda Terkel report: The DGA \"is preparing to potentially spend millions of dollars backing two Democratic candidates who share that position: Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who has indicated he plans to sign a 'heartbeat' bill that would effectively ban abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, and Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, the all-but-certain gubernatorial candidate in Mississippi who is defending a similar law in court. ... [A]bortion-rights activists and progressives argue making that allowance for red-state candidates undermines the party's message and undercuts its supporters.\"\n\n-- The Republicans advancing restrictive abortion laws in states like Alabama and Ohio have risen to power thanks to support from white women, Ronald Brownstein explains in the Atlantic. \"In some of those states, polling shows that opposition to legal abortion is higher among white women than among white men. These attitudes underscore why it's too simplistic to forecast that the renewed push against abortion will uniformly drive women away from the GOP. There's no question that abortion-rights supporters everywhere are mobilizing in opposition to the highly restrictive new laws ... Their success will depend on whether the restrictions dislodge meaningful numbers of white women in these states from their respective Republican coalitions. And that is far from certain, particularly in the southern and border states advancing most of the laws.\"\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nThe president shared a misleading, heavily edited video of the speaker:\n\nPelosi hit back at Trump's comments about her:\n\nRep.

They are parents and grandparents in Mexico who have not seen their undocumented children in the United States for years, even decades. Since 2017, officials here have been working with the U.S. State Department to reunite those families for three-week visits in cities and towns across the United States. For many here, it is an unlikely American olive branch amid the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.

They eagerly applied their talents and theories to ranking each character's chances of winning the throne -- repeatedly. There are scholarly journal articles about how to use a simulation based on the show to teach international relations theory. Rand Corp. has compared the show's dragons to nuclear weapons. A Foreign Affairs article argued that, despite its use of violence, the show was no realist text but 'a critique of the myopic focus on national security over the needs of individuals and the collective good.' (The author cited as evidence Daenerys Targaryen's concern for civilians, a point that didn't fare so well.) There's a good reason for this. It would be hard to imagine a fantasy world better concocted to appeal to international relations scholars than that of Westeros, the setting of Game of Thrones. After all, in many ways, international relations theory and Westeros are cousins since they descend from the same source material: bad European history.\"\n\n-- \"Date Lab:\u2009We set a straight woman up with a gay woman.

Pain of Tariffs Tests Farmers' Faith in Trump", "body": "OSSEO, Wis. -- From the start, President Trump's combative trade strategy toward China has carried the promise that short-term pain inflicted on farmers would be worth the longer-term gains for American producers, from agriculture to technology.\n\nAs the trade war intensifies, faith in that proposition among the president's most stalwart rural fans is being tested more than ever.\n\n\"How long is short-term?\" Shane Goplin, a sixth-generation farmer growing soybeans and corn in west-central Wisconsin, wondered as he maneuvered his 16-row John Deere planter.\n\nChina was the largest buyer of American soybeans until tit-for-tat tariffs all but halted the flow. And this month, souring prospects for a trade deal again sent prices tumbling. Mr. Trump responded on Thursday by announcing a $16 billion package to help those hurt by the dispute.\n\nThe strategy may help shore up farmers' support for Mr. Trump before the 2020 election, but it leaves them with a perplexing question: What does success ultimately look like?\n\nDespite the strain on Mr. Goplin's family bank account and peace of mind, he backs the president's tactics. \"I get why he's doing it,\" he said over the tractor's whir and beeps. \"America has been bullied.\" And if the trade war persisted through the election next year, he added, \"I would be O.K. with that.\"\n\nFederal help is \"very important,\" Mr. Goplin said. The administration's previous $12 billion package of emergency aid meant the difference between profit and loss on his soybeans.\n\nJudging whether an agreement will prove worth the cost, though, is trickier to calculate. Several farmers said that if Mr. Trump declared he had struck a good deal with China, they would take his word for it.\n\n\"I don't think he'll flinch until he gets what he wants,\" said Lorenda Overman, a crop and pig farmer in eastern North Carolina. \"He doesn't mind playing hardball.\"\n\nOther growers suggested that a bump in soybean prices or a drop in the country's trade deficit with China would signal a victory.\n\nLike other farmers throughout the Midwest and South, Mr. Goplin worries, as the standoff with China continues, that soybean producers like Brazil and Argentina could permanently displace American suppliers.\n\nThat is a risk, he said -- like the extreme weather, tight credit and volatile prices that have whipsawed farmers' fortunes over the past decade. And with declining profits, heavier-than-normal debt loads and rising farm bankruptcies in the Midwest, Mr. Goplin, 45, understands that for some growers, it is already too late.\n\nHe had finished planting 500 acres of soybeans this month, a few days after the president announced on Twitter that he was imposing additional tariffs on China. Now, under a postcard-perfect cerulean sky, Mr. Goplin was spending 16 to 18 hours a day getting corn into 2,000 acres of soil. After he completed a patch, he folded the retractable 20-foot-long planting tubes as if they were butterfly wings and got ready to drive to the next field.\n\nFor him, one measure of success would be a sharp reduction in the nation's soybean surplus -- known as the crop carry-over. Last month, the Department of Agriculture forecast that the soybean carry-over would reach 895 million bushels in September, more than twice what it was in 2018.\n\nIn that sense, American farmers are victims of their own success, producing more grain and food than the world market can absorb. At the same time, farmers in other countries, sometimes aided by government subsidies or import quotas, are scrambling for a share of the market, further pushing down prices.\n\nMr. Goplin talked about the tangle of trade and oversupply with his friend Joe Bragger, a sixth-generation dairy farmer in nearby Buffalo County.\n\nThey sat at Mr. Bragger's kitchen table drinking bottles of Moon Man beer as Mr. Bragger's wife, Noel, prepared burgers and potato salad. A teacher, she also cares for the farm's 32,000 pullets.\n\nMr. Bragger, 53, a large man with an infectious laugh, has a voice that squeaks like a backyard swing set when he gets excited. He had just returned from Altoona, Wis., where he listened to Vice President Mike Pence speak at what Mr. Bragger called a \"pep rally.\"\n\n\"We've been in it for -- how long, Shane? -- two years now, squabbling and tweeting,\" Mr. Bragger said of this administration's brawling over trade. \"I can tolerate a few more. \"\n\nMr. Goplin laughed. \"Last Sunday's tweet, it cost ...\" He paused, recalling that the day after Mr. Trump warned on Twitter that he was putting additional tariffs on Chinese goods, the price of a bushel of soybeans dropped more than 10 cents.\n\n\"How much did it cost you?\" Mr. Bragger asked.\n\nMr. Goplin replied: \"$40,000. It was a $40,000 tweet.\"\n\nMr. Pence used his trip to Wisconsin to make a pitch for the administration's trade deal with Mexico and Canada, a pact awaiting congressional approval that the vice president said would help farmers.\n\nTo Mr. Bragger, who with his family owns 330 cows and 1,300 acres where he plants corn, soybeans and hay crops for his livestock, this latest North America trade deal is a \"distraction.\" For a dairy farmer, he said, the difference between the previous trade treaty with Canada and the Trump administration's new one could be produced by a single large Wisconsin farm.\n\nThat doesn't mean he is against the new treaty. He just thinks it is insignificant compared with the real problem, oversupply.\n\nYet the comparison with the Canadian deal raises a question: Could the prolonged dispute with China produce a similar outcome, a relatively trivial gain -- only in this case, one that carries devastating costs for some soybean farmers?\n\n\"At the end of the day, fixing some of these other trade deals for the rest of our country, I'm O.K. with it,\" Mr. Bragger said. \"I'm not going to say don't finish it,\" he said of the China conflict. \"The whole world is watching. I'll support the trade war to the end.\"\n\nMr. Bragger and Mr. Goplin acknowledged that other farmers were in worse shape. Mr. Goplin, for example, locked in higher prices on much of this year's corn and soy crops.\n\n\"If I didn't market anything right, and didn't have any protection on the majority of my farm, I'd be scared to death,\" Mr. Goplin said.\n\nMany farmers are. In North Carolina, Ms. Overman, 57, said she could not handle another bad year. Last season, she lost $450,000 when most of her wheat and soybeans were wiped out by a hurricane, the second in three years.\n\nHer son and son-in-law have both come home to farm. \"But neither of them wants to plant one grain because they see no future in it,\" she said. \"They would be seventh generation, but they're tired of going to the bank and getting a loan and not being able to pay it back.\"\n\nEach bushel of soybeans costs her about $10.35 to grow, she said. The sale price last week, when her family finished planting 1,500 acres of early beans, was $8.03.

Akiko Kashiwagi May 24 at 3:40 AM\n\nTOKYO -- Japan's economy is faltering, South Korea's currency is plunging and both countries have been caught in the middle of U.S. efforts to isolate Chinese tech firm Huawei.\n\nAs President Trump arrives in Japan this weekend for a four-day state visit, the fallout from his trade war with China are reverberating around the region.\n\nIn Japan there is considerable support for Trump's tough line on China, but that's mixed with concern about the impact that the trade war and China's economic slowdown is already having on Japanese exports and factory output.\n\nThere are also concerns that Japan will be next in the president's trade crosshairs, with Trump impatient for a deal to open its market further to U.S. agriculture and threatening to impose steep tariffs on imported cars on national security grounds.\n\nIn Seoul, the won fell sharply this week and has now depreciated by nearly 5 percent against the dollar in a month, pushed down in large part by the slowdown in China, the fall in its currency, the renminbi, and the impact of the trade war.\n\nBoth countries also find themselves caught in the middle of the Huawei dispute: Japan effectively banned the company from competing for government contracts last December, but the private sector's ties to the company are much harder to unravel.\n\nThe Sankei newspaper reported this week that 100 Japanese companies supplied Huawei with parts worth $6.6 billion last year while some of the country's cutting-edge tech firms also collaborate with the Chinese company on development projects.\n\nShares in Japanese electronic component makers Taiyo Yuden and TDK Corp have fallen more than 20 percent this month.\n\nIn a news conference, the chairman of the Keidanren business federation said Japan would have to change its supply chain if the ban on trade with Huawei gets applied to firms here. \"So as not to step on the tail of the U.S. tiger, we must take measures,\" Hiroaki Nakanishi warned on Monday, according to local media.\n\nIn Seoul, the Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported this week that the U.S. government is lobbying South Korea not to use Huawei products.\n\nWhile the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei has helped pushed up shares this week in its competitors in the smartphone market, such as Samsung and LG Electronics, it hit shares in the company's suppliers and sparked wider concerns in a country that depends on China for nearly a quarter of its exports.\n\n\"Lacking a governmental strategy, South Korea gets dragged into a war between China and the United States,\" Chosun Ilbo wrote in an editorial Friday. \"Strategizing on security with the United States and the economy with China will not work anymore, as the two have started an explicit fight for supremacy.\"\n\n[Japan's Abe visits White House in bid to soothe Trump's ego and avoid his ire]\n\nThe broader trade war is also a concern in Japan. A survey of more than 1,000 companies by Mizuho Research Institute, found that more than half are concerned about its impact.\n\nMany are moving to dual-bases for the Asian operations -- not pulling out of China but limiting investment there while expanding operations elsewhere in Southeast Asia, Mizuho found.\n\nThe bigger question is whether Japan will be sucked into a trade war of its own with the United States.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe has been carefully courting Trump to prevent that happening, and on his April visit to Washington boasted that Japanese companies have invested $23 billion to create 43,000 jobs in the United States since Trump took office.\n\nStill, Japan finds its auto industry threatened with 25 percent tariffs, although Trump recently declared he would delay imposing them for 180 days to allow room for negotiations on restricting import volumes.\n\nThe threat was greeted with an unusually sharp rebuke from Akio Toyoda, the president of Toyota Motors and chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, who said he was \"deeply saddened.\"\n\n\"We are dismayed to hear a message suggesting our longtime contributions of investment and employment in the United States are not welcomed,\" he said in a statement.\n\nJapan's car companies, keen to avoid trade frictions, have long operated factories in the United States, and Toyota alone has promised to invest nearly $13 billion there between 2017 and 2021.\n\nBut it is not only cars that are buzzing in Trump's trade bonnet. Japan's decision to push ahead with the Trans Pacific Partnership, an 11-nation trade deal, and also its success in agreeing to a separate deal with the European Union, has resulted in promises to cut agricultural tariffs for a whole swath of countries -- just not the United States.\n\nBecause Trump withdrew from the TPP, the United States is not one of them, and U.S. pork, wheat and barley exporters are already reported to be under pressure.\n\nTrump wants Japan to agree to swift agriculture tariff cuts.\n\nJapan says any deal has to be reciprocal and include corresponding concessions by the United States, to comply with WTO rules and have a chance of ratification by Japan's parliament.\n\nTatsuhiko Yoshizaki, a market economist at Sojitsu Research, says the TPP and Japan-E.U. trade pacts have strengthened Japan's hand in the trade talks with the United States.\n\n\"When the latest round of talks began, Japan did feel under pressure, as it's beholden to U.S.-Japan security relations,\" he said. \"But thinking hard, the situation is different now. It is the United States that is hard pressed to make a deal without delay. Time is on Japan's side.\"\n\nMasahiko Hosokawa, a professor at Chubu University, and former Japanese trade negotiator in the 1980s and 1990s, isn't worried about a trade war. He says Abe's strategy of building a strong personal relationship with Trump is paying off, and notes that there isn't interest in Washington to go after Japan, the country's most important Asian ally.\n\n\"Both Republicans and Democrats are hoping to see President Trump be tough on China, and the tougher he gets, the more votes he gets,\" he said.\n\nHajime Takata, executive economist at Mizuho Research Institute, says Japan's trade deficit in goods, at $68 billion in 2017, was much smaller than China's $419 billion and also a much smaller share of the total than it was three decades ago.\n\n\"At a time when countries are increasingly divided globally, Japan could serve as a bridge in the divided world,\" he said.\n\nMin Joo Kim in Seoul contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nFrom the emperor to sumo wrestling, Abe harnesses Japan's traditions to impress Trump\n\nJapan effectively bans China's Huawei and ZTE from government contracts, joining U.S.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/y00AIV0Z5pP-00dfBhTXP36zwcM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BNHE5IT564I6TDW66SV7KIPPC4.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4806759", "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 296381880}, {"uri": "1144055367", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "23:36:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T23:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.9137254953384399, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-grand-plan-to-rig-government-numbers-in-his-favor/2019/05/23/9449b740-7d99-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html", "title": "Opinion | Trump's grand plan to rig government numbers in his favor", "body": "By Catherine Rampell Catherine Rampell Columnist covering economics, public policy, politics and culture Columnist May 23 at 7:01 PM\n\nDon't like the numbers? Invent new numbers instead.\n\nOr make it harder to collect trustworthy numbers next time.\n\nOr just put the squeeze on the number crunchers themselves.\n\nSlowly but surely, the Trump administration has been chipping away at the independence and integrity of our federal statistical agencies, whose data is critical to keeping our democracy functioning and our economy healthy. So far as we know, the administration still hasn't managed to pierce the citadel of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (the independent agency that releases jobs and inflation numbers) or Bureau of Economic Analysis (the independent agency that tabulates gross domestic product). But around the edges, it's trying to compromise lots of other official government data.\n\nThis week, the New York Times reported that the Environmental Protection Agency plans to massage the model it uses to determine how many people die of pollution. The goal is to make the rollback of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan look significantly less deadly than the current models suggest. This is also part of a broader administrative effort to downgrade official estimates of environmental harm resulting from the administration's deregulatory agenda.\n\nIt's reminiscent of another proposal the administration made this month, relating to how we measure poverty. That's also a technical, boring-sounding, deep-in-the-weeds change that most of the public won't notice.\n\nAt least, not at first.\n\nBut over time, the change would reduce the number of Americans officially counted as poor -- not because they've started earning more money but because this technical, boring-sounding change would redraw the line for who is in or out of poverty.\n\nIf you're a right-wing politician, this change would be a double win. It allows you to claim your policies have lifted families out of poverty, even if they're still struggling. It's also a backdoor way to slash spending on the safety net.\n\nThat's because the poverty threshold is used to determine eligibility for lots of safety-net services, meaning those newly defined as not-poor would also become newly defined as not-eligible for food stamps, Medicare's Part D Low-Income Subsidy program and other benefits. After 10 years, for instance, more than 300,000 children would lose comprehensive coverage through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), according to an estimate from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nWhen directly manipulating official government measures isn't an option, the administration can also mess with the data-collection process.\n\nThat's precisely what's behind the Commerce Department's last-minute decision to jam a citizenship question into the 2020 Census, the constitutionally mandated enumeration of all \"persons\" (not just citizens) in the United States.\n\nImmigrant and ethnic minority populations in this country already have high levels of distrust of government, thanks to xenophobic rhetoric and actions by President Trump (including, at one point, a proposed Muslim registry). Now just imagine what happens if the government suddenly demands that every household in America report the citizenship status of every occupant.\n\nSignificant population undercounts and otherwise inaccurate data can be expected to result, and the consequences of these distortions would be far-reaching. An inaccurate count would skew congressional representation and the allocation of hundreds of billions of federal dollars each year. It would also warp the many other public and private data measures that use the census as a baseline.\n\nThe Supreme Court will soon decide whether the administration's plans can proceed; three lower courts have blocked the question, on the grounds that the administration's actions violate administrative law or the Constitution.\n\nFinally, there's the Economic Research Service, the independent statistical agency housed within the Agriculture Department.\n\nIts researchers compile and analyze data related to crops, yes, but also poverty, food stamps, trade and climate change, among other politically sensitive issues. And right now these economists and statisticians are quitting in droves. That's because the Trump administration abruptly decided to relocate hundreds of positions. Workers were told that if they want to keep their jobs, they have until the end of September to move their families to .\u2009.\u2009. a still as-yet-unnamed new city.\n\nThe relocation is, ostensibly, to save money. But it sure seems like a backdoor purge of an independent agency that has produced analyses inconvenient to the administration, including on the harms caused by Trump's trade wars and how little the 2017 GOP tax overhaul has helped small farmers.\n\nPresumably the Trump administration has calculated that doctoring statistical models, skewing survey results and trying to strong-arm statisticians will serve its near-term political interests. In the long term, however, sowing distrust in government data only reduces the ability of policymakers, businesses and voters to make informed decisions.\n\nOf course, maybe that was the goal all along.\n\nHelaine Olen: Trump's latest scam: Defining poverty out of existence\n\nThe Post's View: Trump is turning a good idea into a tricky way to hurt the poor\n\nCatherine Rampell: The Trump 'brand': Debt and hot air\n\nThe Post's View: The Supreme Court must see through the obvious sabotage behind Trump's census question\n\nCatherine Rampell: The Trump administration's census question degrades our data -- and our democracy", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ukX3DAmby8Zrh0WX1lzEdPH1FPc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WD4NZ3T4XYI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4813868", "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 296350560}, {"uri": "1144001588", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "21:47:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T21:47:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-the-heart-of-trump-country-renewable-energy-is-about-to-flourish/2019/05/23/2052d224-7d8d-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html", "title": "Opinion | In the heart of Trump Country, renewable energy is about to flourish", "body": "By Gary Abernathy Gary Abernathy Contributing columnist Contributing columnist May 23 at 5:20 PM\n\nGary Abernathy, a contributing columnist for The Post, is a freelance writer and former newspaper editor based in Hillsboro, Ohio.\n\nHILLSBORO, Ohio\n\nThose who suggest that President Trump's trade war with China could turn farmers against him forget that farmers, like most people, are not single-issue voters.\n\nEvangelical Christians are among Trump's biggest supporters, and rural America is where such churches thrive. Farmers tend to be churchgoers, and in southern Ohio, they also tend to be pro-life and, perhaps even more devoutly, pro-Second Amendment. Most farmers are hunters, with multiple firearms in their arsenals. They're also big fans of Trump's border wall with Mexico.\n\nA Trump opponent in 2020 who is pro-choice, in favor of curtailing gun rights and opposed to the border wall (is there a serious Democratic hopeful who doesn't check all those boxes?) cannot expect to make much of a dent in rural America, trade war or not.\n\nBut while most southern Ohio farmers are not deserting Trump, there are some who are ignoring his rhetoric on energy. Even as Trump belittles renewable power sources such as windmills -- \"When the wind doesn't blow, just turn off the television darling, please,\" is a favorite Trump jab -- nearly 5,000 acres of farmland here in Highland County could soon be converted from traditional corn and soybeans to shiny new solar panels.\n\nTwo projects expected to consist of a total of 1.5 million solar modules -- creating the largest solar farm in Ohio -- are rapidly working their way through state regulatory agencies. If they gain final approval, which seems likely, construction could start later this year. The combined 450-megawatt projects would be operational by 2021.\n\nCompany officials say Highland County (where I serve on the board of commissioners, which approves the county budget) was chosen because studies show a high rate of optimum sunshine in the region. Local skeptics pointed out that almost no zoning restrictions in the county were a more likely draw. In any case, for farm families here and elsewhere in Ohio -- who are currently rushing to plant crops during a particularly wet spring -- the real impetus for turning cropland into solar arrays is simple economics.\n\nSmall family farms have been on the decline for decades. In his 2012 book, \"A Family Farm: Life on an Illinois Dairy Farm,\" author Robert Switzer noted, \"In 1900, 42 percent of the U.S. population lived on farms; by 1990 that number had dwindled to less than 2 percent.\" The trend has continued thanks to rising costs and growing debt, coupled with decades of stagnant crop prices and the move toward mass production on corporate mega farms. Plus, fewer sons and daughters are interested in continuing the family tradition, making the lure of per-acre prices well above market value offered by solar companies too tempting to turn down.\n\nAt recent public hearings I attended, some among the roughly 30 landowners who are selling or leasing their land for the projects extolled the benefits of solar, but most offered the frank explanation that the deals they were offered were a financial lifeline not only for them, but for their children and grandchildren.\n\nAmong those opposed to the projects were neighboring farmers who are worried about lower property values, soil contamination issues and the loss of the region's farming tradition. Plus, some said, they simply don't want to wake up every day to the sight of thousands of solar modules in fields side by side with their crops.\n\nThe testimony was sometimes heart-wrenching. Some members of multigenerational farm families who have made deals with the solar companies spoke with tears in their eyes. Farming is in their blood, and in a perfect world they would continue the family tradition. But for them, it's been a long time since the world was perfect.\n\nLots of promises are being made by solar enthusiasts about jobs, infrastructure improvements and other benefits for this western corner of Appalachian Ohio. One handout from a solar advocacy group even suggested that such developments can help fight Ohio's opioid epidemic.\n\nBut tipping the scale for most county residents is the promise of more dollars in local communities, particularly for education. Ohio's school funding formula is largely based on local real estate taxes, leading to richer districts in the suburbs and poorer districts in many rural areas. Thanks to Ohio's \"payment in lieu of taxes\" formula for renewable energy projects, solar companies will pay several thousand dollars per megawatt, adding up to millions in additional revenue in the coming years. A couple of small school districts where the projects are located will be the biggest beneficiaries here.\n\nThe president may ridicule wind and solar, but in the heart of Trump Country, renewable energy is about to flourish, providing electricity for thousands of customers -- but only after turning off the lights in a few old barns.\n\nDavid Von Drehle: The energy revolution has already begun\n\nDavid Ignatius: America's bright energy future\n\nThe Post's View: Dear Congress: Burning wood is not the future of energy\n\nThe Post's View: See it, say it: Climate change\n\nRobert J.

Some farmers fear that the protracted trade war with China will permanently alter their sales, leaving them without a foothold in one of their largest markets.(Angie Wang/AP) By Laura Reiley Laura Reiley Reporter covering the business of food May 23 at 3:46 PM\n\nBREAKING: With no end in sight to U.S.-China trade war, President Trump called farm groups to the White House to announce a second emergency package for producers hit hard by tariffs.\n\nThis story will update.\n\nThe Trump administration Thursday announced a new $16 billion farm aid package to offset losses from the U.S. trade war with China.\n\nIn a conference call with reporters, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said $14.5 billion of the $16 billion would be paid out directly to producers, who have been hit hard by Trump's tariff showdowns with China, Mexico and other countries.\n\n\"This package insures farmers will not bear the brunt\" of the trade wars, Perdue said.\n\nAfter Trump slapped tariffs of 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports, Beijing had retaliated with import taxes on U.S. agricultural commodities such as soybeans, badly hurting U.S. producers.\n\nThe aid package is the second bailout for farmers after the Trump administration announced $12 billion in emergency measures last July.\n\nThe relief will be paid to farmers in three installments, with the first payment in July or August. Further payments would take place in November and January 2020 -- assuming the tariffs are still in place at that time, undersecretary for farm production and conservation Bill Northey told reporters on the call.\n\nThe relief plan aims to avoid problems that arose in the first aid package when soybeans received what many believed was a disproportionate amount of the money, while corn received only a penny a bushel. Other producers were shut out entirely from relief payments.\n\nThe bulk of the payments will be set aside for row crops such as alfalfa, wheat and oats, which will be paid at a single rate according to the number of acres planted in each county.\n\nMore niche crops, including tree nuts, sweet cherries, cranberries and grapes, will also be eligible for relief, depending on tariff impacts.\n\nDairy and pork producers also stand to receive relief under the system.\n\nDistributing relief funds by-county, and not by commodity, will hopefully discourage farmers from planting crops that would be more lucrative in aid money.\n\nAn additional $1.4 billion will be used to purchase surplus food for food banks, schools and Native American tribes.\n\nPerdue acknowledged that U.S. farmers have been hit hard by the escalating trade fight with Beijing -- but he said that Trump was working hard to shield them from the worst impacts. He said he remained optimistic about reaching a comprehensive trade agreement with China.\n\n\"All of us are hopeful of a renewed or signing of fair trade deal,\" Perdue said. \"I can't recall a president more concerned about farmer well-being.

Benchmark indexes in China, Germany, France and the United States all dropped. American crude oil prices were down roughly 5 percent, amid growing concern that the ongoing trade war would start to drag on global economic demand. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level this year, in a sign investors were pricing in lower levels of growth and inflation.\n\nHopes for a quick resolution to the China trade fight faded further this week, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying on Wednesday that no additional meetings with Beijing are scheduled and that he is encouraging American firms to reorient their supply chains and source their products elsewhere.\n\nChina's president Xi Jinping this week called for the Chinese people to begin a modern \"long march,\" invoking a time of hardship from the country's history as it braces for a protracted trade war with the United States.\n\n\"The tone of rhetoric that political leaders in both countries have adopted also suggests that it will take time to restore the U.S.-China relationship to where it was prior to the breakdown in talks, let alone to reach the point where a detailed agreement can be finalized,\" Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a research note on Wednesday.\n\n\"I am growing more and more skeptical that there is a place where the two sides can come to a deal,\" said Edward Alden, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"If I look at the positions the two sides have taken at the moment, I do not see a path to a deal.\"\n\nMore companies have been pulling back from doing business with Chinese firms, especially multinationals that provided services to Huawei, the telecommunications equipment giant. The Trump administration announced last week that it would blacklist Huawei over security concerns, prompting Google and mobile carriers to say they would no longer do business with it.\n\nThe Huawei ban, coupled with Mr. Trump's decision to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods and begin the process to tax another $300 billion have exacerbated tensions with Beijing. It has vowed to further retaliate on American products, particularly agricultural goods.\n\nIn a note Wednesday, analysts from Nomura Global Markets Research said their baseline scenario was that Mr. Trump would put a 25 percent tariff on all Chinese exports to the United States by the end of 2019, most likely after he is scheduled to meet with Mr. Xi Jinping at the G-20 in late June.\n\nMore restrictions on dealing with Chinese tech companies could come soon. The New York Times reported Tuesday that the Trump administration is considering another ban on American companies supplying components to Hikvision, a Chinese surveillance camera maker that has been criticized for playing a role in the Chinese government's monitoring and repression of Uighurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic minority.\n\nThe Commerce Department said Monday that it would allow Huawei to continue doing business with American companies for 90 days to prevent disruption to mobile networks that use the company's equipment. But many companies are quickly announcing plans to exit their relationships with Huawei. In addition to Google, which announced that it would cut off support to Huawei for Android hardware and software services, as well as popular applications like Maps and Gmail, German supplier Infeon announced a similar ban. The benchmark index of American semiconductor stocks fell more than 2 percent in early trading, as investors continued to grapple with Trump administration efforts to restrict sales to Huawei.\n\n[Read more about the fallout in financial markets on Thursday.]\n\nMr. Trump has been fighting several trade wars at once, wielding tariffs against metals from Europe, Japan, Canada and Mexico as well as goods from China. In response, trading partners have hit back at American farmers, imposing punishing tariffs on everything from peanut butter to soybeans to orange juice.\n\nOver the last week, the Trump administration has moved to resolve or delay trade conflicts on other fronts, to better focus its efforts on Beijing.\n\nOn Thursday, the Agriculture Department said it would provide up to $16 billion in aid to farmers hurt by Chinese trade retaliation. The amount \"is in line with the estimated impacts of unjustified retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods and other trade disruptions,\" the department said in a statement.\n\nThe new program will make $14.5 billion in direct payments to producers, channeled through the Commodity Credit Corporation, a program that helps shore up American farmers by buying their crops. The payments will be made to agricultural producers for a wide range of products, from soybeans and cotton to chickpeas and cherries, in up to three tranches, beginning in late July or early August.\n\nThe government will also implement a $1.4 billion program to purchase surplus commodities affected by the trade war and distribute them to food banks, schools and other programs for the poor, as well as put another $100 million toward developing new export markets for American farmers.\n\nThe financial support comes after the administration handed out $12 billion in emergency relief for farmers last year, also funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation.\n\n\"China hasn't played by the rules for a long time and President Trump is standing up to them, sending the clear message that the United States will no longer tolerate their unfair trade practices, which include non-tariff trade barriers and the theft of intellectual property,\" Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, said in a statement.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump has insisted any pain will be short-lived and worth the price, administration officials have grown concerned that the president could lose the support of farmers, an important political constituency, ahead of the 2020 election. Those worries helped spur Mr. Trump last week to suddenly drop steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which agreed in turn to withdraw stiff levies on American farm goods.\n\nAfter two years of steadily escalating its trade fights on front after front, the Trump administration appears to be recognizing that the window for cutting deals with allies before the 2020 election is closing. According to administration officials and lawmakers, the president and his top advisers are increasingly feeling that, on the trade front, too many issues remained unresolved and, that trade wars -- like military wars -- are best waged one front at a time.\n\nThat thinking pushed the president and his advisers to decide to delay for six months a decision about imposing tariffs on automobiles around the world, and to reverse their position last week on the tariffs they had levied on Canadian and Mexican metal. It was one of the few times the president has chosen to lift a tariff, instead of imposing new ones.\n\nRobert Lighthizer, the president's top trade adviser, had for months been trying to persuade Canada and Mexico to agree to permanent caps on the amount of metal they send to the United States. But when progress toward a sweeping trade deal with China unexpectedly stalled earlier this month, Mr. Lighthizer decided it was time to try to bring to a close the battle he had been waging in North America, the better to focus on the long war with China, according to people familiar with the deliberations.\n\nHe reached out to Canadian and Mexican officials, offering a deal in which the United States would lift its tariffs if the countries would agree to prevent future surges of metal into the United States market, these people said. If those surges happened, the United States could reimpose tariffs of 10 percent on aluminum and 25 percent on steel on the specific products affected. And Canada and Mexico would agree that, if they retaliated, it would only be on American metal and not on American farmers.\n\nOn Monday, Canada and Mexico officially lifted the tariffs they had imposed on American pork, milk, cheese, wine and other products, a major relief to American farmers who count the countries as two of their top three export markets, in addition to China.\n\nThe collateral damage to farmers from the trade clash with China now looms as a potential obstacle to the president's re-election.

In response, trading partners have hit back at American farmers, imposing punishing tariffs on everything from peanut butter to soybeans to orange juice.\n\nWith no end in sight to several of Mr. Trump's trade fights, particularly China, administration officials have grown concerned that the president could lose the support of farmers ahead of the 2020 election. Those worries helped spur Mr. Trump last week to suddenly drop steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which agreed in turn to withdraw stiff levies on American farm goods.\n\nThe administration will attempt to further cushion the blow with a second bailout package aimed at helping farmers who have lost sales and market share as a result of the trade war. On Thursday, the White House was preparing to welcome farmers for a meeting where it expected to announce a generous bailout.\n\nThe measures are aimed at giving Mr. Trump the ability to continue his trade fight with China, which shows no signs of easing and could continue for months, if not years. Tensions between Washington and Beijing have worsened in recent weeks as the Trump administration increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, prepared to tax another $300 billion and placed Huawei, the Chinese telecom equipment giant, on a United States blacklist.\n\nA spokesperson from the Department of Agriculture said Wednesday that details on a new farming support program would be forthcoming shortly, but cautioned farmers to avoid changing their planting decisions until the details had been clarified.\n\nAfter two years of steadily escalating its trade fights on front after front, the Trump administration appears to be recognizing that the window for cutting deals with allies before the 2020 election is closing. According to administration officials and lawmakers, the president and his top advisers are increasingly feeling that, on the trade front, too many issues remained unresolved and, that trade wars -- like military wars -- are best waged one front at a time.\n\nThat thinking pushed the president and his advisers to reverse their position last week on the tariffs they had levied on Canadian and Mexican metal.

The United States signed that deal with Canada and Mexico late last year, but it still needs to be ratified by legislatures in all three countries.\n\nIt had become increasingly clear that the metal tariffs, which the administration once viewed as leverage to getting a revised Nafta, had become an obstacle to its resolution. Republican lawmakers, along with policymakers in Canada and Mexico, have insisted the tariffs come off before the trade pact was passed into law.\n\nAlso championing their removal was Vice President Mike Pence, who had also been pushing the president to lift the metal tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Mr. Pence, who advocated free trade policies while serving as governor of Indiana, has been touring the United States to promote the passage of the Trump administration's revised North American free trade pact and brought back stories to the White House about manufacturers and farmers who were hurt by tariffs.\n\nThe changes, while helpful, are likely to fall short of propelling the new United States Mexico Canada Agreement through the Democrat-controlled House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats have raised concerns about the deal, arguing that its labor and environmental provisions do not go far enough, and calling for the administration to roll back protections for pharmaceutical companies that Democrats say will complicate their effort to make health care more affordable.\n\nThe administration had been hoping for a Congressional vote on their trade bill this summer. But Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats are in no particular rush to give the president a major domestic policy victory in 2020. She has told associates that she is looking for a way to get to yes, while at the same time depriving Mr. Trump of a domestic policy victory she believes he lucked into.\n\nMr. Lighthizer has a good relationship with the speaker, and other Democrats, but recently he had begun to vent his frustrations about the pace of the talks, according to two senior administration officials involved on the issue.\n\nThat could pose problems for farmers who are depending on the revised pact, which includes more access to Canada's dairy market.\n\nTom Vilsack, a former agriculture secretary who now represents the dairy industry, said on Friday that the removal of the tariffs was an important step but that passage of the revised North American trade agreement and new trade deals with China and Japan remain most crucial to reviving the dairy sector.\n\n\"With the difficulties experienced with the China talks, it was fair to assume that the administration needed to have some positive news coming out of the trade side of the shop,\" Mr. Vilsack said.\n\nBoth the aid package for farmers and the lifting of tariffs on Canada and Mexico are also likely to cultivate some good will for the administration with Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa senator and farmer who also heads the powerful Senate Finance Committee, which will play a role in the deal's passage.\n\nMr. Grassley has been outspoken in his opposition to the metal tariffs and his defense of farmers. On April 28, The Wall Street Journal published an op-ed by the senator arguing that the tariffs would make it virtually impossible to pass the deal, and entitled \"Trump's Tariffs End or His Trade Deal Dies.\"\n\n\"If these tariffs aren't lifted, USMCA is dead,\" Mr. Grassley wrote. \"There is no appetite in Congress to debate USMCA with these tariffs in place.\"\n\nMr. Grassley -- whom Mr. Trump views as the archetypal representative of the Midwest's farming industry -- had given Mr. Lighthizer and Mr. Pence advance notice that he planned to publish the piece. And the article, appearing in one of the few print spaces -- The Wall Street Journal editorial page -- to which Mr. Trump pays close attention, had an impact.\n\nMr. Lighthizer quietly suggested to Mr. Grassley that the tariffs would be dropped. Last Friday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Grassley two hours before announcing the move to tell him that he was lifting the tariffs for the country's workers and farmers, according to a person familiar with the interaction.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/23/business/23DC-TRADE-01/23DC-TRADE-01-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800969", "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 296309940}, {"uri": "1143557917", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "12:08:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T12:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-finance-202/2019/05/23/the-finance-202-wall-street-may-need-to-worry-about-trump-impeachment-talk/5ce5ab3f1ad2e52231e8e782/", "title": "Analysis | The Finance 202: Wall Street may need to worry about Trump impeachment talk", "body": "It may be time for Wall Street to start sweating impeachment talk out of Washington again.\n\nInvestors have largely ignored special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe into President Trump's 2016 campaign -- and subsequent moves by Trump to stymie the investigation, and the fallout over Mueller's report -- for the past year and a half.\n\nBut that wasn't always the case. And the president Wednesday renewed the argument for markets to focus on the matter, amid gathering momentum among congressional Democrats to push for a formal impeachment inquiry. In a huffy Rose Garden performance, Trump declared legislative negotiations will grind to a halt until Democrats drops their investigations of him.\n\nThat would imperil top White House priorities that could also prompt markets to shudder, or worse. Namely, the administration is eager to forge congressional consensus on its reworked trade pact with Canada and Mexico. And as soon as late summer, according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the federal government will exhaust its borrowing authority unless Trump and Congress can agree to lift the debt ceiling. Failing to do so could have cataclysmic results for markets and the wider economy.\n\n\"You certainly want to start thinking about debt ceiling risk,\" says GeoQuant CEO Mark Rosenberg, whose firm uses artificial intelligence-powered indexes to measure various types of political risk. One of his tools -- the \"Mueller Risk Index,\" which measures the likelihood of Trump's early removal from office -- has been trending down since the release of the special counsel's report.\n\nBut his measure of institutional support for the president shows Trump is at one of his weakest points in his ability to bend the branches of government to his will. And, significantly, it shows Trump's grip weakening further as the summer wears on:\n\nThe index, Rosenberg explains, is \"an aggregate of projections for a number of issues relative to institutional support -- investigations of the president, legislative debates, legal battles, appointments and confirmations\" and more, including the fight over the debt ceiling itself. He isn't, however, ready to predict a debt default yet. \"To the extent there's an upcoming calendared event where the elevated institutional risk could have a market impact, that is it... But the pattern is pretty clear: So long as economic data supports the bull market, it's unlikely that politics will derail it,\" he says, adding the administration and lawmakers probably will forge a deal to head off a default.\n\nA senior Trump official appeared determined to communicate that message to markets on Wednesday, telling CNBC's Eamon Javers that Trump's ultimatum to Democrats wouldn't hold up progress toward deals on the debt ceiling and government funding, which is primed to run out Sept. 30. \"Debt ceiling is must-pass, as is Govt funding,\" the official texted Javers. \"So no, that isn't precluded by what happened today.\"\n\nIt wasn't long ago that investors drew a direct link between the investigations dogging the president and policy outcomes critical to economic performance.\n\nIn May 2017, the revelation that Trump pressured former FBI director James Comey to drop a probe of Michael Flynn, the president's former national security adviser, set off one of the steepest stock dives of the year. The fear at the time was that Trump's presidency would unravel before he could deliver major corporate tax cuts and deregulation.\n\nFinanciers flooded Washington analysts with questions about impeachment procedures and stopped in their tracks when Trump-related alerts popped up on their Bloomberg terminals. In June, when Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, both CNBC and Bloomberg TV carried the hearing live.\n\nInterest cooled as summer turned to fall that year and it became clearer the tax cuts were more or less on a glide path to passage.\n\nLately, investors have appeared less spooked by the specter of Washington dysfunction: The S&P 500 actually gained about 11 percent during the month-long government shutdown that ended in January. And with deadlines for the debt ceiling and a budget deal still months away, it's unlikely market participants will start to fixate on those negotiations soon.\n\n\"Obviously this is a concerning headline, but there is a meaningful difference between fiscal brinkmanship today versus fiscal brinkmanship weeks away from the debt ceiling deadline,\" Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point, said in an email.\n\n\"There is a confluence of political risk in the fall with the debt ceiling and spending deadline, but I think the market still expects a resolution on these fiscal fights. Instead, these comments reinforce our bearishness on the prospects for other efforts such as infrastructure spending or prescription drug pricing.\"\n\n-- Fed looks to hold steady. WSJ's Nick Timiraos: \"Federal Reserve officials were broadly comfortable with their make-no-moves posture on interest rates at their April 30-May 1 policy meeting. Many officials at the meeting said they expected a recent soft patch in inflation would be temporary, according to minutes released Wednesday. But several raised concerns about the implications for the economy if price pressures continued to defy expectations by holding at lower levels. Officials didn't specifically raise the prospect of an interest-rate cut, according to the minutes. Investor speculation over a rate cut had increased in the run-up to the meeting.\"\n\nNew York Fed President John Williams to reporters on Wednesday: \"I don't see any strong argument...to move interest rates one way or the other.\"\n\n-- Trade tensions rock global stocks.

MarketWatch's Chris Matthews: \"Active stock pickers are having one of their best years since the financial crisis, and these money managers can thank rising U.S.-China trade tensions for their better fortunes, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. The analysts, led by Arjun Menon, wrote in a Wednesday research note that 42% of large-cap active mutual funds are outperforming their benchmarks so far in 2019, well above the 34% rate averaged during the last decade. Menon argued that escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China are one reason for this improved performance, noting that mutual funds have been underweight the 20 S&P 500 companies with the highest sales exposure to China.\"\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\nEuropean Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the United States might not be ready to work out a trade deal.

Lynch David J. Lynch Financial writer covering trade and globalization May 22\n\nIt may have begun as a trade war, but the U.S. conflict with China is increasingly becoming a technology war.\n\nPresident Trump's decision to confront Beijing over policies that he says discriminate against foreign companies and distort global markets has become a battle for control of advanced communications and computing technologies.\n\nThat evolution is taking the transpacific conflict into sensitive realms of national security and human rights, making a quick settlement an ever more distant outcome. It is also putting at risk a wide array of U.S.-China technology cooperation, including easy access to visas for researchers and venture capital funds for U.S. start-ups -- and threatening to boomerang on U.S. companies that China might retaliate against.\n\nThe administration's decision to blacklist one of China's most prominent companies, Huawei Technologies, along with the likelihood that U.S. officials will take similar action against additional Chinese targets, means the administration's offensive against China is likely to intensify before Trump meets Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit in Japan at the end of June.\n\n\"The trade war really is more about technology than about trade,\" said Paul Triolo, who heads Eurasia Group's global technology policy practice. \"Our sense is that the gloves are off.\"\n\nThe escalating U.S. actions are starting to inflict genuine pain on China.\n\nOn Wednesday, two British telecommunications companies, Vodafone and a unit of BT Group, said they would halt the use of Huawei smartphones on their newest networks. And Arm Holdings, a major designer of mobile-phone computer chips, said it was \"complying with all of the latest restrictions set forth by the U.S. government.\"\n\nAs the financial casualties mount, Xi shows no signs of blinking. On Wednesday, during a visit to southern China, he urged people to prepare for difficulties that he likened to a \"new Long March.\"\n\nThe reference was to the Communists' 1934 fighting retreat that traversed more than 5,000 miles and became an inspirational touchstone for later generations, filling a role akin to that of Valley Forge or Gettysburg in the United States.\n\nIn coming weeks, the administration is expected to impose sanctions on Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology as part of a crackdown on Chinese companies and possibly government officials involved in repressive government policies in Xinjiang province in western China, Triolo said.\n\nOther Chinese companies involved in supplying cameras and computers for the \"Big Brother\" surveillance system that China uses to control the Muslim inhabitants of Xinjiang, known as Uighurs, also may be hit with a range of U.S. punishments, according to Triolo and other industry executives tracking the administration debate.\n\nAmong the potential targets is Hangzhou's Zhejiang Dahua Technology, the world's second-largest video surveillance company, with revenue of $3.4 billion last year.\n\nAn estimated 3 million Uighurs are detained in government camps, Randall Schriver, the assistant U.S. defense secretary for Asia, said earlier this month.\n\nCui Tiankai, China's ambassador to the United States, has denied reports of concentration camps and insisted that Xinjiang residents voluntarily attend vocational training centers. Xi is certain to bristle over any U.S. penalties tied to what Chinese officials traditionally describe as their internal affairs.\n\nThe administration is moving on other fronts to limit commercial ties between the two countries.\n\nEarlier this month, the Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously to bar China Mobile from providing telecom services in the United States. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the commission was \"looking at\" licenses previously granted to two other Chinese carriers, China Unicom and China Telecom.\n\nA Treasury Department-led panel now scrutinizes more closely proposed Chinese investments in U.S. technology companies, and the Commerce Department is drafting new regulations to limit exports to China of 14 categories of advanced technologies, including quantum computing, robotics and artificial intelligence.\n\nLittle more than two weeks ago, the United States and China were on the brink of what Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin billed as a \"historic\" trade deal. Eleventh-hour efforts by Chinese negotiators to water down core provisions prompted Trump instead to more than double tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods and begin the process of taxing all products from China.\n\nOver the past week, Trump also has unleashed his national security team, which has been eyeing tough measures against China for more than a year. On May 15, the president signed an executive order giving the commerce secretary power to bar U.S. companies from buying foreign telecom equipment that might open U.S. networks to \"potentially catastrophic effects.\"\n\nHuawei was not named in the presidential order, but analysts said the measure was clearly aimed at the Chinese telecom giant, which had $105 billion in sales last year.\n\n\"The meltdown of the trade talks gave license to the national security hawks to really run with the ball. It seems like this is just the beginning,\" said David Hanke, a partner at Arent Fox and a former Senate Intelligence Committee staffer. \"China has been waging a tech war against us, but until now the U.S. government was barely pushing back.\"\n\nThe administration says the crackdown is warranted to prevent Chinese companies from embedding their products with technology back doors that would allow Beijing -- in the event of a conflict -- to spy on Americans or disrupt essential services.\n\nIn 2017, the Army ordered a halt to the use of drones manufactured by Shenzhen-based DJI, a leading maker of the unmanned aerial vehicles, amid U.S. government warnings that they were sending data to computer servers in China.\n\nThe company denied the reports, but just this week the Department of Homeland Security alerted U.S. companies about \"the inherent risks associated with using [drone] technology manufactured in China\" and suggested measures they should take to reduce those risks.\n\nChinese companies are heavily dependent on U.S. suppliers for many critical components, including semiconductors. When the Commerce Department last year barred U.S. companies from supplying ZTE, another Chinese telecom company, it was widely seen as a death sentence for the company.\n\nTrump lifted the ban after a personal appeal from Xi and the company's agreement to pay a $1 billion penalty.\n\nChina does not enjoy equivalent leverage, but Chinese authorities can inflict pain on U.S. tech companies if they choose to do so. China accounts for more than 90 percent of global production of rare-earth materials used in smartphones, batteries, guided missiles and other products.\n\n\"China has few if any companies that supply technology inputs to U.S. companies that America either don't produce or cannot buy from friendly nations. China does, however, have a dominant position in rare-earths, a position they have achieved in large part through predatory pricing,\" said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. \"This now can be a potent weapon because rare-earths are key inputs to many advanced products. And while Australia produces rare-earths and the U.S. has significant rare-earth resources, ramping these up will take time.\"\n\nChina also can retaliate against U.S. action via various administrative measures. Already, roughly 1 in every 5 U.S. companies operating in China have experienced additional government inspections or slower customs clearances during the tariff war, according to a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China.\n\nWith little more than five weeks before the American and Chinese presidents are scheduled to meet, most analysts say they think Trump still wants a trade deal.\n\nHe has been mum on Huawei, neither tweeting triumphantly nor warning of potential security risks. And the Commerce Department has granted a temporary license, allowing U.S. companies to continue supplying existing Huawei operations for 90 days, well past Trump's G-20 meeting with Xi.\n\n\"I still think the White House wants a deal,\" said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"Right now, we're in free fall. The hope is we can find some equilibrium.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/piTWIQB8xMXrEbaL_X5KSL74wBQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MCSDVGD4ZII6TDW66SV7KIPPC4.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 296279760}, {"uri": "1142795786", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "15:42:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T15:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/us/politics/china-auto-tariffs-donald-trump.html", "title": "Trump Lifts Metal Tariffs and Delays Auto Levies, Limiting Global Trade Fight", "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump agreed on Friday to lift tariffs on metal imports from Mexico and Canada, removing a major irritant for two important allies that in exchange agreed to stop punishing American farmers with their own taxes on pork, cheese and milk.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Trump postponed a decision on whether to impose tariffs on automobiles imported from Europe, Japan and other countries for six months, setting a tight deadline for the United States to reach trade deals that have so far proved elusive.\n\nTogether, the actions remove the threat of an all-encompassing global trade war and allow Mr. Trump to focus on pushing China to agree to the United States' trade terms, as well as pressuring Europe and Japan to reach a trade deal before the 2020 election. His trade war has hurt many of the farmers who make up his political base, and he is eager to make good on a 2016 campaign promise to rewrite trade deals in America's favor.\n\n\"I'm pleased to announce we've just reached agreement with Canada and Mexico. We'll be selling our product into those countries without the imposition of tariffs,\" Mr. Trump said on Friday.\n\nThe United States trade representative said in a statement that the metal tariffs would be removed and both Mexico and Canada \"had agreed on the removal of all retaliatory tariffs imposed on American goods by those countries.\"\n\nThe easing of trade tensions in North America could give Mr. Trump more leeway as he pursues an ambitious trade fight with China, which has imposed tariffs on American products in retaliation for the president's levies on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods. Mr. Trump on Wednesday announced sweeping restrictions against Chinese telecom companies like Huawei, and he has threatened to tax all Chinese imports, prompting concerns from farmers and other businesses caught in the cross-fire.\n\nOn Friday, it became clear that pressure to reach an accord with Canada and Mexico before the 2020 elections outweighed the president's affection for the steel and aluminum tariffs he imposed last year.\n\nThe metal tariffs are linked to a broader free trade agreement, the newly negotiated Nafta, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Mr. Trump had described the tariffs as a source of leverage in negotiating a revision to that deal, which has yet to be ratified by legislatures in all three countries.\n\nBut both Republicans and Democrats had said they would not sign off on that deal until the White House removed metal tariffs on Canada and Mexico. They argue that the levies are raising costs for American companies and consumers, and that Canadian and Mexican retaliation is hurting American farmers and businesses.\n\nA congressional aide who has been involved in the talks between the three countries said the White House was growing increasingly sensitive to pressure from Republicans in rural states whose farmers have been suffering from reprisal that diminished their access to sell in neighboring markets. Their problems were compounded when talks with China broke down this month, this person said.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who has spent weeks traversing Midwestern states to sell the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in Congress, relayed the complaints of manufacturers and farmers hurt by the tariffs to Mr. Trump, telling him, \"We've got to get moving on this.\"\n\nWhile rescinding the metal tariffs will remove one important obstacle to the passage of the trade deal, others remain. House Democrats have insisted that the pact include more labor and environmental protections.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, is in no particular rush to give the president a major domestic policy victory in 2020, according to people familiar with her views.\n\nJes\u00fas Seade, the under secretary for North America at Mexico's Foreign Ministry, said that he hoped that ending the dispute would give \"an extra push\" toward ratifying the agreement. Mexico will lift its retaliatory tariffs in a couple of days, he said.\n\nSpeaking from Stelco, a steel producer in Hamilton, Ontario, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said on Friday that the deal was \"pure good news\" and would help clear the way for the passage of the agreement. \"We are very optimistic we will be able to move forward in coming weeks,\" he said.\n\nAs the White House eased tensions with Canada and Mexico on Friday, it continued to pressure allies elsewhere, including Europe and Japan. Those governments are still not exempt from the steel and aluminum tariffs, and they are likely to bear the brunt of auto tariffs that could reach 25 percent, should Mr. Trump opt to impose them.\n\nThe White House's announcement Friday of a delay in determining whether to impose levies on foreign automobiles delivered a temporary reprieve to global automakers and auto suppliers, which had been bracing for punishing tariffs on millions of cars imported into the United States each year. But it also set up a tense six-month period for the White House to reach trade deals with Japan, Europe and other nations that have already been complicated by mistrust and disagreements.\n\nIn a proclamation Monday, Mr. Trump said that imports of foreign cars and car parts were causing harm to the American automobile industry and threatening national security and that other countries had 180 days to address the problem through trade agreements with the United States.\n\nIf agreements \"to address the national security threat\" are not reached, Mr. Trump said he would determine \"whether and what further action needs to be taken,\" a step that could include imposing 25 percent tariffs on foreign cars.\n\nCar companies and industry groups said that a delay did not go far enough and that Mr. Trump should abandon any plan to impose car tariffs.\n\n\"The continued threat of tariffs on cars and auto parts only creates more uncertainty weakening our economy,\" said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nMany outside the administration have criticized the linkage of cars with national security, pointing out that the bulk of American auto imports come from the country's closest allies. Mexico, Japan, Canada, Germany and South Korea were together responsible for more than 85 percent of American automotive imports in 2018. Canada and Mexico have negotiated exclusions to the car tariffs as part of their earlier trade negotiations, but it is unclear if car tariffs will affect other countries, including South Korea.\n\nIn a statement, Toyota called the White House's announcement \"a major setback for American consumers, workers and the auto industry,\" saying that it \"sends a message to Toyota that our investments are not welcomed, and the contributions from each of our employees across America are not valued.\"\n\n\"The idea that U.S. automakers are threatened by automotive imports is fundamentally flawed and ill conceived,\" said John Bozzella, the president of Global Automakers, which represents foreign car brands. \"No automaker or auto parts supplier asked for this 'protection.'\"\n\nThe United States has struggled to make headway in preliminary negotiations with the European Union, which has balked at Mr. Trump's demands to allow more agricultural products like chicken and cheese into Europe.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly criticized Europe for flooding the American market with cars while limiting imports of United States vehicles, and has called for revised trade terms that make the relationship more fair. But he also previously rejected a more straightforward proposal from Europe to simply scrap automotive tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nSpeaking to the National Association of Realtors on Friday at a Washington hotel, the president denounced the European Union for putting up trade barriers to American farm products and cars.\n\n\"The European Union treats us, I would say, worse than China. They're just smaller,\" he said. \"They send Mercedes-Benzes in here like they are cookies.\"\n\nThe European Commission said in a statement Monday that it would work constructively with American partners. \"Neither the U.S. nor the E.U. can have an interest to enter a trade conflict.\"\n\nThe Trump administration wants Europe to buy more American farm products, like meat and dairy, and says a deal without agriculture will not pass Congress. But Europe insists that agriculture is not on the table.\n\nReaching a deal with Europe in six months could be difficult, especially given that elections for the European Parliament next week are expected to strengthen protectionist parties on both the left and the right. Leaders of the Green coalition in Parliament say they will not sign trade agreements with countries that have not ratified the Paris climate change accord, which Mr. Trump has pulled out of.\n\nThe United States and Japan have also been discussing a bilateral trade deal that could give American farmers more access to Japan's market. But those talks, which began nearly two years after Mr. Trump pulled out of a multilateral trade deal with Japan known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, also have yet to move beyond the initial stages.\n\nJapanese officials say that they are counting on the close relationship between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to keep trade negotiations from souring between the two countries. Mr. Trump is scheduled to visit Japan next week, and his hosts are planning a full slate of high-level hospitality. That includes a state dinner with the new emperor and empress, rounds of golf and a visit to a sumo wrestling championship, where Mr. Trump will award the winner's trophy.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/us/17DC-AUTOTARRIFF-promo-sub/17DC-AUTOTARRIFF-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 296235720}, {"uri": "1142710974", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "14:22:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T14:22:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4549019634723663, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-needs-a-strategy-he-cant-bluff-our-enemies-into-surrender/2019/05/22/b96add6e-7c05-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html", "title": "Opinion | Trump needs a strategy. He can't bluff our enemies into surrender.", "body": "By Max Boot Max Boot Columnist covering national security Columnist May 22 at 9:38 AM\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton published a fire-breathing memoir in 2007 called \"Surrender Is Not an Option,\" in which he detailed all of the steps he had taken as a government official to protect U.S. sovereignty. Most of the threats he fulminated against were trivial, such as the remote possibility that the International Criminal Court would bring charges against U.S. troops. Yet he regarded them as matters of high principle worth alienating U.S. allies over.\n\nNow imagine how Bolton would react if a foreign power demanded that the United States give up its nuclear arsenal. Or drop its support for allies such as Israel. Or stop its subsidies to major corporations such as Boeing and Alcoa. Or end its spying on other countries. Or even usher President Trump out of office before his term expires.\n\nYet those are the rough equivalents of the demands the Trump administration is making on North Korea, Iran, Venezuela and China -- simultaneously. Trump and his hard-line advisers have no strategy to achieve their ambitious objectives beyond acting tough and hoping for the best. And yet somehow they appear surprised that those countries are resisting U.S. pressure. Trump and his aides can't imagine the United States surrendering on important issues of sovereignty, but they expect other countries to do so.\n\nNow, I am not drawing any moral equivalence between the United States and these dictatorships -- as Trump himself does. I think we are right to demand that North Korea end its nuclear program, Iran its support for regional proxies, China its intellectual property theft, and Venezuela its illegitimate dictatorship.\n\nBut I believe those things because I believe in the importance of human rights, free trade and international law. Trump and Bolton don't. They believe in no higher cause than raison d'\u00e9tat. As Trump told the United Nations: \"As president of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you as the leaders of your countries will always and should always put your countries first.\" Pyongyang, Beijing, Caracas and Tehran are simply following Trump's advice to act in their own self-interest.\n\nSo on what basis does Trump tell these countries -- every bit as sovereign as the United States -- how to behave? Having sacrificed the moral high ground, he is left with nothing but brute force: Do what we say or else. The problem is that there is a yawning mismatch between his maximalist ends and minimalist means.\n\nAll four of the rulers in question fear they cannot survive if they cave in to U.S. demands. Kim Jong Un thinks he needs nuclear weapons to avert a U.S. invasion or unification on South Korea's terms. Xi Jinping thinks he needs an industrial policy and economic espionage to keep China growing and the Communist Party in power. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei thinks he needs to sponsor proxy groups and build missiles to maintain his regime's legitimacy and deter enemies such as Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro thinks he needs to stay in power to avoid imprisonment or death.\n\nIn their minds, complying with U.S. demands is more dangerous than not complying. Cuba, Iran and North Korea have shown that regimes can survive prolonged U.S. sanctions, so Trump's sanctions and tariffs don't fill anyone with dread. These dictators might make a different calculation if they thought that noncompliance would bring a decisive U.S. military response. But by now they have all figured out that Trump is a paper tiger who growls and roars but ultimately shrinks from war.\n\nI had expected that by now Trump would drop his hard-line demands and strike meaningless deals. He's done it before: The biggest difference between NAFTA, which he hated, and the USMCA, which he loves, is the name. I still expect this will happen in other disputes, but for now Trump is hanging surprisingly tough, even though he is starting to suspect that Bolton's hard-line advice is leading him toward failure in Venezuela, North Korea and Iran.\n\nThe answer isn't to cave in and call it a victory. Trump needs to align means and ends. In short, he needs to develop an actual strategy. Shocking, I know.\n\nTrump should pick his battles rather than try to do everything at once; so, for example, he shouldn't add Israel-Palestinian negotiations to a to-do list that is already way too long. He should marshal allies rather than alienate them -- e.g., don't start a new trade war with Europe while the old one with China remains unresolved. He should recognize that some issues don't have an immediate solution: North Korea simply isn't going to give up its nuclear weapons. And he should soften some of his demands. He might, for instance, have more luck ending China's intellectual property theft than its state support of key industries. Or getting Iran to stop its nuclear program rather than its activities abroad -- except, oops, Iran already agreed to that and Trump tore up the agreement.\n\nSooner or later, Trump needs to figure out that he isn't going to simply bluff powerful adversaries into surrender. To become a truly effective dealmaker (something he has never been), he needs to see the world through his enemies' eyes. But that would require a trait -- empathy -- that is utterly missing from his psychological makeup.\n\nMax Boot: A war with Iran would be the mother of all quagmires\n\nMarc A.

(Kevin Dietsch/Pool/Bloomberg News) By David J. Lynch David J. Lynch Financial writer covering trade and globalization May 21 at 11:25 PM\n\nThe Trump administration is considering blacklisting another major Chinese technology company in a move that would broaden a U.S. campaign to sever China's access to American know-how and inflame a deepening trade conflict, according to an individual familiar with the debate.\n\nThough no final decision has yet been reached, the administration is preparing to move against Hikvision, the world's largest maker of video surveillance technology, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The deliberations were first reported by the New York Times.\n\nThe disclosure comes less than a week after the administration barred U.S. companies from supplying Huawei Technologies, perhaps China's most prominent manufacturer, without first obtaining a U.S. government license. The administration earlier this week relaxed the ban, saying it would grant temporary 90-day waivers for U.S. companies to help Huawei maintain its existing networks.\n\nU.S. officials are said to be eyeing the same penalty for Hikvision, using a Commerce Department mechanism known as the \"entity list.\"\n\nCiting national security considerations, Congress last year banned federal agencies from purchasing equipment made by Hikvision and four other Chinese technology companies: Huawei, ZTE, Hytera and Dahua.\n\nThe measure was triggered by \"classified information the committee reviewed in the course of our regular oversight activities,\" according to Claude Chafin, a spokesman for the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nHikvision supplies surveillance cameras that the Chinese government has deployed throughout the Muslim-majority Xinjiang region to combat what it describes as separatist terrorism.\n\nRandall Schriver, assistant secretary of defense for Asia, said earlier this month that the Chinese government is detaining 3 million Muslim Uighurs in reeducation camps. The authorities in Beijing describe the facilities as vocational training centers.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Cui Tiankai, China's ambassador to the United States, denied reports of human rights abuses. \"They are real training centers,\" he said. \"They are not camps. They have open gates. There's no armed guards. People could go home over weekend.\"\n\nHikvision last month reported earning about $1.65 billion on revenue of roughly $7.2 billion in 2018. In its annual shareholder letter, the company said it had faced numerous challenges last year but remained \"upbeat about growth in the domestic and overseas markets in the years ahead.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's intensifying campaign to limit China's access to advanced U.S. technologies comes as a year-long trade conflict defies hopes of an early settlement.\n\nDespite the president's continued pursuit of a trade deal, the administration has been cracking down on China in other realms. The Justice Department in December indicted two hackers who allegedly worked with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, targeting companies holding advanced technologies with military applications.\n\nThe Commerce Department is drawing up new regulations to restrict U.S. exports of 14 advanced technologies, including robotics and quantum computing, in a move motivated by concern over China's access to American innovations.\n\nSome Trump administration officials want to disconnect American investors and companies from Chinese companies that help beef up the Chinese military, \"Big Brother\" surveillance networks or those that benefit from China's alleged theft of U.S. trade secrets.\n\nLast year, the Commerce Department banned state-backed ZTE from doing business with American suppliers after the company violated the terms of an earlier enforcement action.\n\nBut the president reversed the ban, which would have crippled ZTE, after a personal plea from Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe episode illustrates that any move to sever Chinese companies' links to the United States might cause collateral damage to the U.S. economy. ZTE spends about $2.6 billion annually buying products from U.S. companies such as Qualcomm and Intel. Huawei also relies heavily on American suppliers.\n\nAdministration officials recognize that the greater the number and significance of Chinese companies affected by sanctions, the greater the pain for U.S. companies and their workers.\n\nEllen Nakashima in Washington contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pVUyJT8GdUI2MNx23mVkURNmBQw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M4WRZST4E4I6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4804044", "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 296198100}, {"uri": "1141957321", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "03:15:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T03:15:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4980392158031464, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/world/asia/xi-jinping-china-trade.html", "title": "China Faces New 'Long March' as Trade War Intensifies, Xi Jinping Says", "body": "BEIJING -- President Xi Jinping of China has called for the Chinese people to begin a modern \"long march,\" invoking a time of hardship from the country's history as it braces for a protracted trade war with the United States.\n\nMr. Xi's call, made on Monday, referred to the Long March, a grueling 4,000-mile, one-year journey undertaken by Communist Party forces in 1934 as they fled the Nationalist army under Chiang Kai-shek. From there, they regrouped and eventually took control of China in 1949, making the Long March one of the party's foundational legends.\n\nThe comments appear intended to stir the spirit of the Chinese people as the Trump administration continues to press China on trade. But they also seem to acknowledge that the Chinese public could face difficult times ahead. The tariffs come as Beijing tries to lift the economy out of a slowdown, and as a variety of unrelated factors raise the prices of basic food items like pork and fruit for the average Chinese shopper.\n\nSpeaking at the site of the start of the Long March in Jiangxi Province, Mr. Xi told a crowd of cheering locals that \"now there is a new long march, and we should make a new start.\"\n\nHe did not mention the trade war directly, and Mr. Xi has used the term \"the new Long March\" in speeches before to exhort officials, military officials or ordinary citizens to follow his policies. But the visit, broadcast on state-run television on Tuesday, came as tensions flare between the world's two biggest economies. Among the officials with Mr. Xi was Liu He, his chief economic adviser and top trade negotiator.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Xi told another audience in Jiangxi that the country \"must be conscious of the long-term and complex nature of various unfavorable factors at home and abroad, and properly prepare for the various difficult situations.\"\n\nThe trade war shows little sign of letting up. In the latest move, the Trump administration is considering placing a Chinese company called Hikvision on a list that would limit its ability to procure American technology like chips and software to meet its needs. The company, which provides equipment for China's growing surveillance state, said in a statement on Wednesday that it \"has never in the past done any business that requires us to violate human rights.\"\n\nAt a daily news briefing on Wednesday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said, \"China opposes the U.S. practice of abusing state power and arbitrarily discrediting and suppressing foreign enterprises, including Chinese enterprises.\"\n\nIn one of the first gestures hinting at a potential opening salvo, Mr. Xi on Monday visited a rare earths mine in the city of Ganzhou, which some observers saw as an attempt to remind Mr. Trump of the leverage that China has when it comes to certain resources. Rare earths are found in many of the electronics that the world uses every day, and China is the largest source. China has used its control of rare earths to exert pressure before, most notably in 2010 when it halted all exports to Japan for two months over a territorial dispute.\n\nMr. Xi later called on the industry to continue to \"intensify efforts\" to develop rare earths, calling them a \"strategic resource.\" At a media briefing on Wednesday, officials told reporters not to read too much into the visit, adding that it was a routine visit.\n\nThe Chinese state media has ratcheted up nationalistic rhetoric in the past few days, comparing the trade war to the Korean War, during which Chinese troops were in direct combat with American forces. Over the weekend, China's national movie channel, CCTV-6, ran back-to-back films about the Korean War, saying that the footage was \"echoing present times.\"\n\nThe central point of those films is that \"there's no equal negotiation without fighting,\" Hu Xijin, the editor of Global Times, a newspaper owned by the Communist Party, wrote on Twitter over the weekend.\n\nChina in the past has successfully rallied its people to target businesses owned by Japanese and South Korean companies during disputes with those countries. With the trade war with the United States, China has to move more carefully. American products are often made in Chinese factories, and China needs its consumers to keep spending as it tries to turn around its growth slump.\n\nChinese consumers also have more immediate concerns. Even as the economic slowdown appeared to be stabilizing, certain living costs have risen steeply.\n\nA vicious African swine fever that swept across China has led to more than a million pigs being culled, driving up the price of pork. A steep increase in the price of vegetables and fruit has led many people to complain online that they no longer have \"fruit freedom\" -- the ability to buy as much fruit as they like.\n\n\"Everyone has personally felt a rise in prices,\" said Zhang Lifan, a historian and former businessman.\n\n\"Normal people will have to bear the consequences of the Chinese trade war. There is no way to fight this, and the new Long March is not sustainable,\" Mr. Zhang said.\n\nFor people like Xu Jifeng, who works for an American telecommunications company in Beijing, the back and forth between China and the United States has little bearing on his day-to-day life. He said he would most likely choose a Huawei phone over an Apple phone the next time he needs to upgrade. But he was more interested in talking about the rising cost of produce.\n\nMr. Xu, 44, said the price of a watermelon has gone up by more than a dollar.\n\n\"I think this reflects the bad overall state of the economy,\" Mr. Xu said. \"The government says it's just temporary and that they will keep it under control.\"\n\n\"But coming at the same time as these China-U.S. trade frictions, I think fruit prices must be showing the effects.\"\n\nIn April, the price of pork jumped 14 percent compared with a year earlier, while the broader food consumer price inflation rose 6.1 percent, according to government statistics. By the end of last week, the average price of a basket of fruit had hit a nearly five-year high of $1.10 a kilogram, according to official statistics.\n\nSo many people online were talking about the rising costs of fruit that #fruitfreedom became a top trending topic on Weibo, China's most popular social media site.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics blamed the weather, and said that the price increase was short-term. \"The price increase of fresh fruits will not continue to be high,\" a spokeswoman for the bureau said.\n\nPeople have responded online by posting photographs of fruit with commentary about how much less they can afford. One woman complained that her usual haul of fruit from the supermarket was costing her nearly as much as she would pay for a new lipstick.\n\nOne person wrote on Weibo, \"Now the price of fruit is really more expensive than meat. From now on, when I eat apples, I don't dare to peel the skin, not even spit out the seeds.\"\n\nAnother asked \"Where is fruit freedom? All I can achieve is cold water freedom.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexandra_stevenson@nytimes.com", "name": "Alexandra Stevenson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/22/world/22china-xi1/22china-xi1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4801161", "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 296190900}, {"uri": "1141791843", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:20:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/business/us-china-tariffs.html", "title": "In China, Some Fear the End of 'Chimerica'", "body": "Wu Shichun is one of countless Chinese entrepreneurs who over the past four decades have prospered from access to American customers and money.\n\nToday, as the American government threatens to take that away, the serial entrepreneur and venture capital investor is fundamentally rethinking how he does business.\n\nOne of his portfolio companies designs and makes fashion products in China, then sells to American consumers on Amazon.com. Another, a vape device maker, sells most of its products in the United States. The third, which makes metal materials for electronic manufacturers, exports 40 percent of its production there. All three would be hit by new American tariffs.\n\n\"From now on I'll have to invest in companies that focus on the Chinese market,\" said Mr. Wu, 42.\n\n\"I hope China and the U.S. can find a better way to coexist,\" he said. \"It doesn't have to be mutually destructive.\"\n\nThe Chinese government has struck a defiant tone since President Trump ratcheted up the trade war on Friday by raising tariffs on Chinese exports worth $200 billion a year. \"If the U.S. wants to talk, our door is open,\" said a commentary on state-controlled China Central Television on Monday night that quickly went viral. \"If the U.S. wants to fight, we'll be with them till the end.\"\n\nMany entrepreneurs and intellectuals, by contrast, are hoping for a deal. China's rise out of the stark terror of the Cultural Revolution was fueled in part from connections to the United States, an early diplomatic partner that offered investment, markets and opportunity. There's even a word going around the Chinese internet for the tight economic bonds that have formed between the world's two largest economies: \"Chimerica.\"\n\nThe trade war is taking direct aim at Chimerica. New tariffs, if they stick, threaten to cut off a big market for many Chinese companies.\n\n[Trump's love for tariffs began in Japan's '80s boom.]\n\nBeyond tariffs, trade hawks within the Trump administration are pursuing what they call decoupling, or breaking up a relationship that they now feel poses a long-term strategic threat to the United States. The trade hawks hope to get American companies to shift their factories to friendlier countries. They are pushing to restrict Chinese investment in the United States and cut academic and other bonds.\n\nNow many people in China are wondering what will happen if the countries decouple. They question whether the country can continue its miraculous rise as borders and barriers go up.\n\n\"From the day we were born, my generation has always seen the country's economy heading for the better,\" Feng Dahui, an early Alibaba employee and an internet entrepreneur in the city of Hangzhou, wrote on his timeline on WeChat, the Chinese social media service, on Monday evening.\n\n\"We've experienced the internet revolution and enjoyed the benefits of globalization,\" he continued. \"Now this type of optimism seems to be deserting us. Everything seems to be ending abruptly.\"\n\nTheir concerns are unlikely to sway the Chinese government. Most political analysts believe that the only effective pressure will have to come from within the Chinese Communist Party's leadership, and official voices have been uniformly strident. Negative commentaries have been stricken from China's heavily censored internet.\n\nStill, some entrepreneurs are expressing their worries.\n\nXiao Yu said the e-commerce business he founded, OFashion, which sells luxury goods from Europe and the United States to Chinese consumers, saw growth slow in the second half of last year partly because of the trade war. While only about 10 percent of its merchandise comes from American brands like Michael Kors or Coach, the trade war has hit China's stock market and hurt consumer confidence.\n\nThe trade war could jeopardize his dreams of raising money from American investors and perhaps even taking his start-up public on an American stock exchange, he said.\n\n\"As an entrepreneur, our fate is tightly bound to the country,\" Mr. Xiao said. He hopes and is confident that the two countries can reach a deal.\n\n\"China and the U.S. don't have to have strained relations,\" he said.\n\nMany also appear worried that the trade war and the government's tightening control over the private sector could halt or even reverse its progress. In a country only a couple of generations removed from starvation, the possibility doesn't seem far-fetched to many. One 2017 post online, called \"A Guide to Eating Tree Bark,\" described how people in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia survived during the starvation of the Great Leap Forward. It has recently gone viral again, with more than 100,000 page views.\n\nThe two sides have plenty of reasons to distrust each other. The United States blames China for heavy job losses, theft of corporate secrets and cheating at the rules of global trade. China credits the hard work and sacrifices of its people for its success and sees the trade war as driven by American fears of a prosperous Chinese nation.\n\nBut the doves in China say both sides benefit from the relationship more than they admit. Foreign investors were early backers and inspirations for Chinese internet giants like Alibaba and Tencent, for example. And many American companies and investors have profited handsomely from China's rise.\n\nThose hoping for a deal worry that the Chinese government has fundamentally misjudged the Trump administration. At three top-level economic and monetary meetings in April, an economist at a Chinese investment bank said, government officials sent the signals that the leadership was optimistic about a trade deal.\n\nSome people are resurrecting old articles online about the Chinese-American relationship that are now going viral. One of them was a January speech by Li Ruogu, a former chairman of the Export-Import Bank of China and former deputy governor of China's central bank. Mr. Li argued that many Chinese, including some senior officials, didn't realize that the relations had shifted fundamentally. The conflict wasn't about the United States being threatened by China's growth, he said, but by its vision of state-led capitalism.\n\n\"This is the conflict of systems,\" he wrote. \"It won't end easily.\"\n\nAnother popular, and subsequently censored, article had the headline \"The Reasons Behind the Chimerica Breakup,\" recalling the portmanteau coined by Niall Ferguson and Moritz Schularick. The popularity of the article, whose author is anonymous, reflects a growing realization that the two countries' conflicts go beyond trade and may not have an easy solution.\n\nThe article argues that China's system of low human rights-based mercantilistic state capitalism negatively affected the pricing and wage structures in the United States and other developed economies. Now the United States wants China to change its economic growth model, the author argued, while China only wants to buy more American products to solve short-term trade imbalances.\n\n\"Chimerica parted ways on May 10,\" the author wrote. \"Now it's time to decide whether to adopt the U.S. rules or the Chinese rules.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "li_yuan@nytimes.com", "name": "Li Yuan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/14/business/14NEWWORLD-1-promo/14NEWWORLD-1-promo-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v2.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 296169600}, {"uri": "1141791846", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:20:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4705882370471954, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/world/asia/us-china-trade-war.html", "title": "U.S.-China Trade Standoff May Be Initial Skirmish in Broader Economic War", "body": "WASHINGTON -- A yearlong trade war between the United States and China is proving to be an initial skirmish in an economic conflict that may persist for decades, as both countries battle for global dominance, stature and wealth.\n\nProgress toward a trade agreement nearly collapsed this past week, with both sides hardening their bargaining positions. And even if a trade deal is reached, it may do little to resolve tensions between the world's two largest economies.\n\nThe United States is increasingly wary of China's emerging role in the global economy and the tactics it uses to get ahead, including state-sponsored hacking, acquisitions of high-tech companies in the United States and Europe, subsidies to crucial industries and discrimination against foreign companies.\n\nThe Trump administration has begun trying to limit China's economic influence in the United States and abroad, warning about China's ambitions in increasingly stark terms. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, compared China's ambitions to Russia and Iran in a speech in London last Wednesday, saying Beijing poses \"a new kind of challenge; an authoritarian regime that's integrated economically into the West in ways that the Soviet Union never was.\"\n\nThe United States has been erecting barriers to limit Chinese investment in American companies, re-examining the kinds of technology that can be exported to China and restricting China's role in building America's next-generation telecommunications networks, while also discouraging other countries from using Chinese equipment.\n\nThe F.B.I. has increased its scrutiny of Chinese researchers in the United States over fears they may be acquiring intellectual secrets. A Justice Department initiative is targeting commercial espionage of American technology, and earlier this year the United States unveiled a sweeping indictment of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, over accusations of stealing trade secrets and evading American sanctions on Iran.\n\nChina, whose ambition is to dominate industries of the future, is pushing back. A column on Saturday in the Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper stated, \"The United States is again waving the club of tariffs after misjudging China's strength, capacity and will, further escalating trade friction between our two countries.\"\n\nThe piece was written under the pen name Zhong Sheng -- the \"voice of China\" -- a name used when the paper publishes comments on foreign affairs that are authoritative.\n\nRestraining China's ambitions and methods is a tricky task -- and there is concern that the Trump administration's effort is creating a new red scare, fueling discrimination against China and its citizens that could ultimately hurt the United States. As many as 30 Chinese professors have had their visas to the United States canceled in the past year, or been put on administrative review, according to Chinese academics and their American counterparts.\n\n\"We've got decades of painful negotiating with China ahead,\" said David Lampton, a China scholar at Stanford University. Mr. Lampton said a trade deal, if reached, would do little to resolve the bigger conflict. \"It's just a skirmish in an ongoing battle.\"\n\nChinese negotiators returned to Beijing over the weekend without a trade agreement and with even larger economic barriers between the two countries. The Trump administration raised tariffs on $200 billion in exports on Friday and said it would move ahead with the legal process of taxing another roughly $300 billion of products at the same 25 percent rate.\n\nThe two countries could yet come to an agreement that opens opportunities for businesses and rolls back the levies they have placed on each other. Both American and Chinese officials said on Friday that they would continue to talk and could meet in Beijing next month. Liu He, China's vice premier, called the failure to reach a deal \"just a small setback in the talks between two countries,\" while Mr. Trump, in a tweet, described the talks as \"candid and constructive.\"\n\nWhile a trade deal could calm some tensions and establish more good will between the two nations, it is unlikely to achieve many of the ambitious goals that the administration has set for itself. Mr. Trump's advisers, in particular the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, have been focused on what the administration calls China's practices of \"economic aggression.\"\n\nBut the administration has struggled to address the immensity of the problems in the text of a trade deal. People close to the talks say that the negotiators appear powerless to force any changes that aren't in China's interest.\n\nMr. Liu, who is leading China's team in the trade negotiations, hinted at that uphill battle in a video statement released by the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n\"Now both sides have reached consensus in many respects, but frankly there are also areas of disagreement,\" he said. \"We believe that these are major matters of principle, and any country has its own important principles -- we can't make concessions on matters of principle.\"\n\nDespite punishing tariffs already on nearly half of Chinese exports to the United States, Beijing is still resisting many of the most significant changes that the administration seeks. It has been reluctant to roll back subsidies for advanced manufacturing industries or to make public commitments to stop cybertheft.\n\nInstead, a trade deal between the two countries seems more likely to bring change around the margins -- tens of billions of dollars of soybean purchases, some tariffs lifted and changes to the text of Chinese laws or regulations that the country might ultimately disregard, particularly once another administration occupies the White House.\n\n\"This is a decades-long endeavor,\" said Robert Daly, the director of the Wilson Center's Kissinger Institute on China and the United States. \"This can't be waved away over cake at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nThe notion that the United States has one last shot to change China's behavior is held by an array of people on both sides of the political spectrum. But it is an aggressive notion of American power to upend a rival system that has delivered prosperity for its people and put China on course to be the world's largest economy.\n\nMany in China see the United States as a declining power bent on enforcing its will on a world that no longer cowers before its hegemonic might. The troubles in American democracy and the long economic slump after 2008 persuaded many in China that its instincts to chart its own course were correct. In the eyes of many Chinese, their country is simply reclaiming its historic status as a dominant regional power in Asia.\n\nIt has also projected power across Asia, Africa and elsewhere while the United States has, on many fronts, retreated from its post-World War II commitment to the global order. But it has done so with little application of military force, in sharp contrast to what many in China see as American militarism.\n\nMany in China have sought to avoid a trade conflict, which could have a larger impact on their economy than the United States'. But they have long thought the United States would have a difficult time accepting a true peer in economic, technology and military power, so consider the management of conflict with the United States to be an inevitable result of their own rise.\n\nWhile the Trump administration accused China of breaking a trade deal, China's resistance to the emerging terms stemmed from its belief that the United States was asking too much and offering too little in return. Many of the changes the United States seeks would limit what Chinese officials regard as a tried-and-true approach of using tens of billions of dollars from state-owned banks and government investment funds to turn previously small industries like car production or solar panel manufacturing into the largest industries of their kind in the world.\n\nAnd the Chinese view some of the Trump administration's demands as infringing on their sovereignty and giving America too much power over their economy -- including requiring the country to codify changes through legislation in the National People's Congress. To the increasingly nationalistic public in China, the American requests are reminiscent of 19th century history of unequal treaties forced on the country by foreign powers.\n\nMr. Trump on Saturday suggested China was simply delaying a deal in the hopes that a Democrat would win election in 2020 and continued his pugilistic approach, saying \"the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term. Would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting BIG TARIFFS!\"\n\nIn the United States, China's unwillingness to bow to America's demands is uniting lawmakers like the Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.\n\nThat is a significant shift from the prevailing view in the United States since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 that close economic engagement with China would produce an increasingly democratic country that would be closely tied to an international economic order founded mainly on Western liberal ideals.\n\nThat has not happened.\n\nChina has indeed grown in prosperity, leaping into the ranks of what the World Bank defines as upper-middle income countries. Its economy is now bigger than any other country except the United States. Its manufacturing sector is now bigger than those of the United States, Germany and South Korea combined.\n\nBut in the last five years, China has veered toward increasingly repressive authoritarianism at home and a rapid military buildup. The State Department estimates that Beijing has put 800,000 to two million Muslims in hastily built internment camps ringed with barbed wire in northwestern China. The Chinese government has built an archipelago of air bases on artificial islands in the South China Sea in between Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. And China now has the world's largest navy and has conducted military exercises as far away as East Africa and the Baltic Sea.\n\nOn the economic front, the competition is even fiercer. Trump administration officials warn that China is trying to dominate the global 5G infrastructure that will be the basis for future mobile communications and is competing to set other technological standards that will determine which global companies win.\n\nChina is extending low-cost loans and building infrastructure around the globe through its One Belt, One Road program, which critics warn is making poorer countries beholden to China. It is out-investing the United States in some high-tech industries, and is gaining dominance in certain segments, like mobile payment, new energy vehicles and areas of artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile American companies have long hankered for access to China's growing market, their position has begun to shift as they see China's practices and treatment of foreign companies. A survey released by the American Chamber of Commerce in China in February showed that the majority of its members favored retaining tariffs on Chinese goods while trade negotiations continued.\n\nChina's own experts say that the Beijing leadership has been caught off guard by the pace of change in American perceptions of Sino-American relations.\n\n\"Even if there is some kind of agreement between Xi and Trump, in the long run the strategic bilateral relationship is already in trouble,\" said Zhang Jian, a professor in the School of Government at Peking University. \"There is no coming back, even if there is a deal.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/12/us/12dc-tradewar-sub-2/merlin_153827598_526c0d28-e557-4511-a8da-a90f4aa0af0b-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800969", "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 296169600}, {"uri": "1141791849", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:20:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5529412031173706, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/business/china-trump-trade-tariffs-reaction.html", "title": "China, Defiant but Careful, Promises Aggressive Response to Tariffs", "body": "BEIJING -- When the United States ratcheted up trade tensions with Beijing on Friday, the news was greeted with weariness and foreboding among the people in China who will pay the immediate price: owners of factories big and small.\n\nBrook Chen runs a plant in Shanghai that makes suitcases for brands including Samsonite. More than four-fifths of his orders come from the United States.\n\nThe trade war, now nearly a year old, has already squeezed Mr. Chen's bottom line. American customers insisted that he lower his prices so they wouldn't have to raise theirs. When he contemplates moving production out of China -- to Southeast Asia, for instance -- he worries about losing access to China's vast supply chain and capable work force.\n\n\"This is totally a lose-lose situation,\" Mr. Chen said. \"We lose profits and have to shut down. American importers cannot find effective alternatives that can deliver products with the same quality.\"\n\nThe Chinese government issued a muted response on Friday after President Trump raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. China's Ministry of Commerce vowed to retaliate, although it did not say how or when. Still, global financial markets -- which have been hit by trade tensions in recent days -- rose in hopes of an eventual deal.\n\nChina's heavily controlled news media have been walking a careful line, calling for defiance but not more dramatic action, such as a boycott of American products.\n\nBefore Friday's tariff increase, multiple state media outlets had published a cryptic, anonymously written article with the headline, \"If You Want to Talk, We Can Talk. If You Want to Fight, We'll Fight.\" The article presented China as a calm, neutral presence upon which American policies had, very regrettably, exerted pressure.\n\nChinese people are polite by nature, the article said, yet unafraid of confrontation. \"We are prepared to fight back,\" it said.\n\nThe question for Chinese leaders is how long the higher tariffs will last. China has ways to keep its economy humming, at least in the near term. Negotiators also have time to reach a deal, as the Trump administration effectively delayed the tariff increase by saying they only applied to goods that leave China on Friday or later. Oceangoing goods, in other words, won't get hit by the 25 percent levy until they arrive at American ports over the next few weeks.\n\nStill, China's economy has shown it isn't invulnerable. Some factories are already suffering.\n\n\"You can definitely feel the anxiety,\" said Lu Mengxi, the founder of a winery in northwestern China that sells both domestically and abroad, including in the United States.\n\nWhat began last year as an investigation into China's practices toward American companies operating within its borders has turned into a sprawling conflict that has weighed on financial markets and economic activity across the globe.\n\nWhile analysts widely believe the two countries will eventually reach a deal to avert a trade dispute that could seriously hurt the world economy, the appetite for further conflict seems unabated on both sides.\n\nAmerican companies operating in China have generally chided both countries' governments for using tariffs to bring each other to the negotiating table. On Friday, however, Ker Gibbs, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, sounded more favorably inclined toward the Trump administration's policies and less tolerant of Beijing's.\n\n\"While many of our companies are hurt by the tariffs and ongoing trade tensions, we understand the U.S. government's frustration,\" Mr. Gibbs said in a statement. \"There needs to be a deal that rebalances the economic relationship.\"\n\nFew in China appear to believe that a change of tactics is due, either.\n\n\"It would be easy to do what a small minority of people in China are advocating, and to go along with America on everything,\" Hu Xijin, editor in chief of the state-run newspaper Global Times, wrote in a commentary on Friday. \"But that just won't do. That would not be responsible to the people's interests.\"\n\n\"The trade negotiations have gone on for so long because the two countries' fundamental interests cannot be reconciled,\" Nicole Zhang, 26, an employee at an online travel company, said while shopping in a Beijing mall on Friday. \"National interests are unfeeling things like that. That's just how it is.\"\n\nAt the beginning of the year, China's position was more defensive. Its economic growth slowed in the second half of last year, in part because tariffs hurt business confidence. Since then, the Chinese government has poured billions of dollars into the financial system and pressed state-run banks into service extending credit.\n\nOfficials said last month that the economy grew 6.4 percent in the first quarter of the year, matching the pace from the previous quarter. Industrial output has been solid. Shoppers have opened their wallets.\n\nStill, for many Chinese businesses, especially those that sell overseas, uncertainty remains front of mind. China's exports to all major regions, not only to the United States, grew more slowly in the beginning of this year. Should the trade war intensify further, China may find it increasingly expensive to prop up its economy, and it could face another slowdown or widespread job losses.\n\nThe state news media have worked to reassure the country's consumers. In a headline published on Friday before the tariffs rose, the People's Daily newspaper, which is the Communist Party's mouthpiece, declared that Chinese trade \"has positive momentum and strong driving power.\"\n\nSome companies with business on both sides of the Pacific are trying to stay positive, too. N\u00e9e Lau, the owner of Amourvino Winery in Napa, Calif., said the tariffs China imposed last year had hurt his profits. Still, Mr. Lau said he would rather not raise prices, even if it meant earning less for now. Holding onto his overseas dealers and clients, he said, was more important to the long-term health of his business.\n\n\"The United States and China will definitely come to some kind of agreement. It's just a matter of time,\" Mr. Lau said. \"It's impossible for a war between two superpowers to go on forever.\"\n\nJason Wang, who owns a shoemaker in Fujian Province that sells to the American market, says that what frustrates him is that the tariff negotiations are taking place far from the people, like him, who are most directly affected.\n\nMr. Wang also lamented the nationalist sentiment on both sides that he felt had egged on the two countries' leaders.

The White House said talks would resume again on Friday but it remains uncertain whether the two sides can bridge the differences that have arisen over the past week.\n\nIn his comments at the White House on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Trump vacillated between threatening China and suggesting a deal could still happen. The president said he had received a \"beautiful letter\" from President Xi Jinping of China and would probably speak to him by phone, but said he was more than happy to keep hitting Beijing with tariffs.\n\n[U.S.-China trade war worsens, but global markets find a footing.]\n\n\"I have no idea what's going to happen,\" he said. \"They'll see what they can do, but our alternative is, is an excellent one,\" Mr. Trump added, noting that American tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese products were bringing \"billions\" in to the United States government.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, China's Ministry of Commerce said that the government \"deeply regrets that it will have to take necessary countermeasures.\" It didn't specify what those countermeasures might be.\n\n\"It is hoped that the U.S. and Chinese sides will meet each other halfway and work together\" to resolve their dispute, the statement added.\n\nMarkets in Asia and Europe rose in Friday trading, suggesting investors still believe the two sides can reach a deal.\n\nThe renewed brinkmanship has plunged the world's two largest economies back into a trade war that had seemed on the cusp of ending. The United States and China were nearing a trade deal that would lift tariffs, open the Chinese market to American companies and strengthen China's intellectual property protections. But discussions fell apart last weekend, when China called for substantial changes to the negotiating text that both countries had been using as a blueprint for a sweeping trade pact.\n\nMr. Trump, angered by what he viewed as an act of defiance, responded on Sunday by threatening to raise existing tariffs to 25 percent and impose new ones on an additional $325 billion worth of products. China has said it is prepared to retaliate should those tariffs go into effect.\n\n\"We were getting very close to a deal then they started to renegotiate the deal,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We can't have that.\"\n\nChinese officials said the decision to come to the United States after Mr. Trump's tariff threat showed they are serious about trying to reach a resolution. But it is unclear whether China is willing to make the changes that the Trump administration is demanding, including codifying much of the agreement into Chinese law.\n\n\"I come here facing pressure,\" Liu He, China's vice premier, said on Thursday in an interview with China Central Television in Washington. \"That expresses China's greatest sincerity. And we want to resolve some of the differences we face honestly, confidently and rationally. I think there is hope.\"\n\nAn administration official described Mr. Xi's letter to Mr. Trump as conveying a nice, diplomatic tone but noted that the word \"equality\" was included, suggesting that China believes the United States is demanding too much and that a trade agreement must be more equitable. Mr. Xi also said he believed that his friendship with Mr. Trump would endure the trade dispute.\n\nDespite the overture, the administration official said that this round of talks had the dour feeling of heading toward a breakup. There is a growing sense of disappointment in Mr. Xi being unable to follow through on things that Mr. Trump's trade negotiators thought had been addressed.\n\nMr. Trump's decision to impose 25 percent tariffs on nearly one-third of all Chinese products is the biggest trade action that Mr. Trump has taken so far. The higher tax hits many consumer products that Americans rely on from Beijing, like seafood, luggage and electronics, raising prices for American companies and their customers across a large portion of sectors.\n\nStock markets fell Thursday in the United States, but pared some of those losses after Mr. Trump's comments in the afternoon. The S&P 500 index ended the day down less than 0.5 percent.\n\nTalks resumed at 5 p.m. on Thursday at the offices of the United States trade representative, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump's top trade negotiator, continued them over a dinner with Mr. Liu and some members of the Chinese delegation.\n\nThe new 25 percent rate went into effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday. But the higher tariffs will hit only products that leave China after that time, not those already in transit. That could provide some additional time for the two sides to reach an agreement. Mr. Trump may also be able to rescind the tariffs once a deal is reached, retroactively reversing the higher rates.\n\n\"This week is really a challenge if you've got boats on the ocean,\" said Brian Keare, the field chief information officer at Incorta, who advises companies like Broadcom, Starbucks and Apple on scenario planning amid the uncertainty they face under the Trump administration. \"If I've got 30 days' notice, I can make a smarter decision. If I've got 72 hours, my hands are more tied.\"\n\nChina, which has already placed tariffs on nearly all of America's exports, including agriculture products, has threatened to respond with additional \"countermeasures\" to Mr. Trump's latest tariff.\n\nLyle Benjamin, the president of the Montana Grain Growers Association, said that China had essentially stopped buying American wheat since last year. He was hopeful that a trade truce would change that, but now he expected prices to keep falling.\n\n\"It's highly frustrating, particularly in the agricultural sector, to be collateral damage as we try to achieve these trade goals for other industries,\" Mr. Benjamin said. \"It's a tough game right now and it's tied almost entirely to this trade war.\"\n\nBut Mr. Trump, already emboldened by a healthy American economy, may be encouraged to keep his trade war going given the monthly trade deficit with China fell in March to its lowest level since 2014 as China slowed its exports to America. The overall United States trade deficit with the world increased 1.5 percent in March to $50 billion, as it continued to import more goods and services than it exported worldwide.\n\nMr. Trump has seized on that shrinking deficit as evidence that his trade policy is narrowing the trade deficit and boosting growth, as have some of his supporters.\n\nThe Trump administration has done projections on the effect of the additional tariffs on the economy and believes that the negative effects will be minimal and pale in comparison to those facing China, an administration official said. The White House will consider taking additional measures to mitigate the effects of any retaliatory measures that China takes against America's farmers.\n\n\"To the president's credit, the tariffs are working,\" said Dan DiMicco, the chairman of the trade lobbying group Coalition for a Prosperous America and a former trade adviser to Mr. Trump during his 2016 campaign. \"America's manufacturers and workers are now seeing gains as manufacturing employment rises and China's hold on the U.S. market shrinks.\"\n\nMr. Trump's toughened stance toward China has rattled American businesses, which had been anticipating a trade truce but are now bracing for higher tariffs.\n\n\"Clearly, we think a negotiating strategy based on tariffs is the wrong direction,\" said David French, the senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation.\n\nRetailers wielded their influence successfully in 2017 when Republicans were considering a tax plan that they believed would have harmed their businesses. But when it comes to trade, Mr. French said that the Trump administration had been intransigent about their tariff concerns. To make its point, the retail association has been holding events featuring businesses that are suffering from tariffs in politically important states like Ohio.\n\nMost business groups agree with Mr. Trump that China engages in unfair trade practices. Among the shared concerns is that China needs to protect American intellectual property and curb subsidies for state-owned enterprises. But those businesses, which depend on China for many of the products they rely on and sell, say the economic pain of tariffs makes them a poor negotiating tool.\n\n\"American business continues to have major problems with China's commercial policies, but we simply must find a way to tackle these that doesn't turn our most competitive companies into collateral damage,\" said Peter Robinson, the chief executive of the United States Council for International Business.\n\nMr. Robinson suggested that the United States should team up with other trading partners to pressure China to change its ways and work with the World Trade Organization to adjudicate its complaints.\n\nBut administration officials have begun to run out of patience with China, which they say reneged on several areas of agreement over the weekend. After a meeting last week in Beijing, Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Lighthizer were angered to receive a new draft of the agreement from the Chinese with major revisions to provisions they thought had been agreed to. According to people who have been tracking the talks, Chinese officials determined that many of the concessions they were being asked to make would clash with Chinese laws, which the government was not prepared to change.\n\n\"The administration has been talking to China for months now about specific things that needed to change in Chinese law,\" said Clete Willems, a former member of Mr. Trump's trade team who left recently to become a partner at the law firm Akin Gump. \"The administration was operating under the assumption that some of that would be part of the deal, so to the extent that China is saying that's no longer possible, that is a pretty big reversal.\"\n\nWall Street analysts have been girding for more volatility this week and many have been adjusting their predictions about the likelihood of an all out trade war.\n\n\"The opportunity window for avoiding a trade war is closing fast,\" economists at Citigroup wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThey warned that an increase in tariffs could begin to push up inflation in the United States and tighten financial conditions. A full-blown trade war is expected to be a drag on global economic growth.\n\nThus far, most companies have managed to absorb the brunt of the initial batch of China tariffs, keeping inflation at bay, but analysts said that jumping to a rate of 25 percent is impossible to ignore.\n\n\"Any maneuverability these companies had been using to blunt the impact of these tariffs is very likely exhausted,\" said Henrietta Treyz, the director of economic policy at the investment advisory firm Veda Partners.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/09/business/09DC-CHINATRADE-1/09DC-CHINATRADE-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800969", "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 296169600}, {"uri": "1141791853", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:20:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7803921699523926, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/business/trump-china-tariffs.html", "title": "Trump Could Raise Tariffs on China. Here's How China Could Respond.", "body": "A week ago, the United States and China looked as if they were going to reach a deal to end their trade war. Today, they are trying to salvage their many months of negotiations.\n\nVice Premier Liu He, a senior Chinese economic policy maker, is set to begin two days of negotiations in Washington on Thursday aimed at heading off an escalation. On Sunday, President Trump accused China of trying to renegotiate the nearly finished trade deal and threatened to impose more tariffs on Friday. Chinese officials have said they would respond, without specifying how. The prospect of a deepening trade war between the world's two largest economies has scared investors and darkened the global economic outlook.\n\nChina has strongly denied that it reneged on anything. \"Over the past one year's negotiation, our sincerity and kindness is obvious,\" Gao Feng, a Commerce Ministry spokesman, said at a news briefing on Thursday. \"Negotiations are the process of exchanging ideas, solving problems and reaching consensus. The two sides having different views is normal.\"\n\nChina has options if Mr. Trump goes ahead with his threat, including ways to strike at American businesses that go beyond tariffs.\n\n\"We expect China to quickly retaliate with matching tariffs,\" said Jake Parker, a vice president in Beijing for the U.S.-China Business Council, a business advocacy group representing 200 mostly large American companies that do business with China. \"We are also advising our members to prepare for increased customs scrutiny, regulatory enforcement at the local level, and diversification away from U.S. products.\"\n\nStill, Beijing's choices are painful and could hurt the Chinese economy just as much as they could hurt the United States.\n\nTrump's trade threat\n\nPresident Trump said on Sunday that American tariffs of 10 percent on $200 billion in Chinese goods, imposed last September, would rise to 25 percent on Friday. The tariffs would take effect just after midnight on Thursday, meaning the United States could wake up on Friday to an even more damaging trade war. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that the tariffs might be reconsidered if Beijing restored what the United States regards as previous Chinese commitments, and made progress beyond them.\n\nThe president also threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion in Chinese goods, without specifying when.\n\n[China 'broke the deal' on trade, and Trump's retaliation starts Friday.]\n\nMeeting tariffs with tariffs\n\nChina's obvious choice would be higher, and possibly wider, tariffs.\n\nIt could raise the retaliatory tariffs that it imposed on American-made goods last autumn. When President Trump imposed his 10 percent tariffs, Beijing responded by imposing a range of tariffs, from 5 percent to 25 percent, on $60 billion a year of American goods. That covered about two-fifths of Chinese imports from the United States.\n\nChina could also revive import barriers specifically aimed at some of the states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2016 election. In December, amid improved chances for a trade deal, China resumed buying American soybeans after it stopped buying them last summer. China also removed the 25 percent tariff that it had imposed last summer on American-made cars and sport utility vehicles.\n\nFor China, the problem with retaliatory tariffs is that they might not be enough to persuade Washington to relent. China has worked to diversify its economy, but it still depends heavily on exporting manufactured goods abroad, including to the United States. While some American businesses would be pinched by retaliatory Chinese tariffs, the broader economic impact on the United States could be more limited.\n\n[Read more about how China has tried to stabilize its economy recently.]\n\nTariffs are also only applied to a small portion of the prices consumers pay for purchases, so American shoppers wouldn't see big changes in price tags.\n\nChina could broaden its tariffs to cover the one-third of its imports from the United States that it has not yet penalized. These are mainly semiconductors and Boeing aircraft. But Chinese companies need the semiconductors, and there are few rival producers elsewhere for some of them. They would simply have to pay the tariffs and become less competitive.\n\nPutting tariffs on Boeing aircraft poses the same dilemma for Beijing. It would force Chinese airlines to buy from Airbus, the only real alternative supplier. Airbus would then be able to charge much higher prices.\n\nWeaponizing shoppers\n\nAnother option is for the Chinese government to encourage the country's consumers to boycott American products, or to allow such boycotts to be organized at a grass-roots level. China has used this weapon during foreign policy disputes with South Korea and Japan over the past decade.\n\nBut once unleashed, Chinese nationalism could be hard to contain. If a boycott led to anti-American protests in the streets, Beijing's ability to reach deals with the United States would be constrained. A boycott also could hurt China's consumers, by limiting their choices, and hurt the Chinese workers who make American-branded cars, assemble iPhones and brew Starbucks lattes.\n\nChina's other options\n\nIf China really wants to fight back hard, it has other options. But all of them have big potential drawbacks.\n\nIt could delay imports from the United States through elaborate customs inspections and quarantines. China temporarily delayed last year its imports of Lincoln sport utility vehicles by the Ford Motor Company and apples, oranges and cherries from American farmers. It could also send inspectors to check out the business licenses and operations.\n\nIf China wanted to get Mr. Trump's attention in a big way, it could outright hinder the global supply chain. China makes a huge amount of the parts and components that American companies need to produce their finished products. Many American companies have asked trade officials for exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese goods, contending that they are heavily dependent on these products. Lou Jiwei, a former finance minister of China with many connections to the Chinese leadership, suggested at a conference last September that Chinese officials might study the filings and block exports of some of these products.\n\nThat would disrupt corporate supply chains. But it could also permanently damage China's reputation as a reliable supplier for practically every large company in the West. Foreign companies are already re-evaluating their dependence on China as a manufacturing hub.\n\nFinally, China could let the value of its currency, the renminbi, slide sharply against the dollar. That would make China's exports less expensive and more competitive in foreign markets, and could partly offset the cost of higher tariffs.\n\nBut letting the renminbi drop could pose the greatest risks of all. It would make oil and other imports more expensive in China, fanning Chinese inflation at a time when prices are already starting to rise. And if a falling currency prompts Chinese companies and families to evade limits on moving their money overseas, a flood of outbound money could destabilize China's financial system.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keith_bradsher@nytimes.com", "name": "Keith Bradsher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/09/world/09chinaoptions-promo/09chinaoptions-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800969", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 296169600}, {"uri": "1141791840", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:20:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/us/politics/mnuchin-senate-nafta-steel-aluminum-tariffs.html", "title": "White House Reassesses Auto Tariffs as It Focuses on China Fight", "body": "WASHINGTON -- The White House has decided to delay for six months a decision due Friday about whether to impose levies on foreign cars and car parts, people familiar with the situation said. Such a move would have taken aim at Japan and Europe, big auto manufacturers, and likely disrupted trade talks that the Trump administration had just begun.\n\nThe decision reflects the administration's reassessment of pieces of its tariff strategy with allies around the world as it focuses on an all-encompassing trade war with China.\n\nOn Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also said that the United States was closing in on an agreement with Mexico and Canada to roll back tariffs on steel and aluminum, which were imposed last year. If the administration does, it would end a standoff that has heightened tensions among the three countries and complicated efforts to pass the new North American Free Trade Agreement into law.\n\n\"I think we're close to an understanding with Mexico and Canada,\" Mr. Mnuchin said at a Senate hearing Wednesday, although he added that he was not ready to say that the United States was lifting tariffs. \"I can assure you it is a priority of ours.\"\n\nAsked after the hearing about the prospect of a deal with China, Mr. Mnuchin was cautious.\n\n\"I'm hopeful,\" he said. \"I wouldn't say I'm confident.\"\n\nThe potential rollback of certain tariffs reflects the challenge of fighting trade wars on multiple fronts. Lawmakers and businesses are putting more pressure on the White House to concentrate their efforts on combating China's unfair trade practices, while reversing far more unpopular tariffs on allies like Europe, Canada and Mexico.\n\nYet the outcome for these tariffs is still uncertain. Mr. Trump has long been a devotee of tariffs, viewing them as an effective way to rebalance trading relationships. Political advisers and auto industry executives have emphasized that the president will make the final decision on whether to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on foreign cars.\n\nThe specter of auto tariffs has hung over relations with the European Union and Japan, both major suppliers of automobiles to the United States. Canada and Mexico have negotiated a quota with the United States as part of their trade agreement that would exempt them from the measure.\n\nThe president has frequently floated the idea of auto tariffs in the past, but two people familiar with the matter said that the White House had decided to delay a decision on the levies for six months, one of the president's options under current trade law.\n\nThe decision was due by Friday, but the tariffs have provoked fierce opposition among industry leaders and in Congress. In addition, the White House is now engaged in preliminary trade talks with the European Union and with Japan, and auto tariffs would throw a bomb into those negotiations.\n\n\"Pleased that @POTUS has delayed decision on auto tariffs,\" Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, tweeted Wednesday in response to media reports that the levies would not be imposed.\n\nAuto tariffs would have opened another front to Mr. Trump's trade war, but one with much smaller potential benefits and larger political liabilities. Auto industry executives on both sides of the Atlantic are opposed to tariffs, and the duties would have inflicted collateral damage on some of his most loyal voters in states like Alabama and South Carolina, which are home to big Mercedes-Benz and BMW factories.\n\n\"Our biggest market is Germany,\" said Jeppe Kofod, a member of the European Parliament from Denmark. \"The mere fact that Germany is hurt -- we would be very much affected by that.\"\n\nThe 25 percent tariff on steel and the 10 percent tariff on aluminum that the Trump administration imposed last year have had a more muted economic effect, but they have done much to rattle alliances.\n\nMexico and Canada, both of which retaliated with tariffs of their own, have previously appeared to be close to an agreement. But Mr. Trump has been hesitant to relent over his desire to protect America's steel and aluminum sectors and his belief that the tariffs might be used as further leverage.\n\nThe United States and Canada sent mixed signals Wednesday about the future of the steel and aluminum tariffs. The Canadian foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, declined to say whether the countries had struck a deal to lift those tariffs after meetings with lawmakers and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, in Washington on Wednesday.\n\nMs. Freeland said that her conversations had been \"productive\" and that the two sides had been in constant contact in recent weeks. But she suggested that it would be a mistake to predict how long negotiations would last.\n\n\"As has been the case from the outset, we believe that these tariffs need to be lifted,\" Ms. Freeland said.\n\nEven if the president rolls back metal levies on Canada and Mexico, the current level of tariffs in the United States would remain high. The levies that Mr. Trump has put in place have given the United States a tariff rate that is twice as high as the rates imposed by Canada, Britain, Italy, Germany and France. And the overall tariff would increase greatly should Mr. Trump choose to impose measures on foreign cars.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats in Congress have been sharply critical of the metal tariffs, warning that the new Nafta deal would not pass until they were removed.\n\nMs. Freeland said Wednesday that a failure to remove the tariffs could doom the deal in Canada.\n\n\"As long as the tariffs are in place, ratification will be very, very problematic,\" she said.\n\nThe United States has been trying to persuade Canada and Mexico to agree to a quota system for steel and aluminum in exchange for rolling back the tariffs. Canada and Mexico have pushed back.\n\nIt is unclear what terms the three countries are close to settling on. But Mexican officials have expressed optimism on the topic. A senior Mexican official said this week that recent talks about removing the tariffs had been \"fruitful.\"\n\nSenator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he had been pressing Mr. Trump to eliminate the metal tariffs completely.\n\n\"It's critical to the credibility of our global trade agenda,\" Mr. Grassley told reporters on Tuesday. \"I say the president needs to lift these tariffs.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/business/15DC-TRADE--1/15DC-TRADE--1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 296169600}, {"uri": "1141790178", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:17:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:17:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4823529422283173, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/upshot/unemployment-inflation-changing-economic-fundamentals.html", "title": "The Economy That Wasn't Supposed to Happen: Booming Jobs, Low Inflation", "body": "Maybe using data from a few decades in the middle of the 20th century to set policy in the 21st isn't such a good idea.\n\nThe labor market the United States is experiencing right now wasn't supposed to be possible.\n\nNot that long ago, the overwhelming consensus among economists would have been that you couldn't have a 3.6 percent unemployment rate without also seeing the rate of job creation slowing (where are new workers going to come from with so few out of work, after all?) and having an inflation surge (a worker shortage should mean employers bidding up wages, right?).\n\nAnd yet that is what has happened, with the April employment numbers putting an exclamation point on the trend. The jobless rate receded to its lowest level in five decades. Employers also added 263,000 jobs; the job creation estimates of previous months were revised up; and average hourly earnings continued to rise at a steady rate -- up 3.2 percent over the last year.\n\nCompare that reality with the projections the Federal Reserve published just three years ago. In mid-2016, Fed officials thought that the long-run rate of unemployment would be around 4.8 percent, and that this would coincide with 2 percent inflation.\n\nIf that were the jobless rate today, 1.9 million Americans would not be working who are instead gainfully employed. And despite this ultralow unemployment rate, inflation is only 1.6 percent over the last year, below the level the Fed aims for.\n\nBecause this is 2019 and everything immediately devolves into partisan warfare, these good results are immediately seized upon by Trump partisans who view the good news as a result of the president's policies, and by opponents who give credit to the already-improving economy that President Obama handed over in January 2017.\n\nThere is truth in both. The job market had already been improving for years when President Trump took office, and its performance since then has been more continuation of the trend than an abrupt upturn.\n\nAfter more than two years of the Trump administration, warnings that trade wars and erratic management style would throw the economy off course have proved wrong so far, and tax cuts and deregulation are most likely part of the reason for the strong growth rates in 2018 and the beginning of 2019 (though most forecasts envision a slowing in the coming quarters as the impact of tax cuts fades).\n\nIn particular, it now appears that recession fears that emerged at the end of 2018 were misguided -- especially once the Fed backed off its campaign of rate increases at the start of 2019.\n\nBut beyond the assigning of credit or blame, there's a bigger lesson in the job market's remarkably strong performance: about the limits of knowledge when it comes to something as complex as the $20 trillion U.S. economy.\n\nThe last few years have made it clear that the Phillips curve -- the relationship between unemployment and inflation -- has either changed shape or become irrelevant.\n\nThe breakdown of the old guidelines suggests that policymakers need to avoid overreliance on them, and to stay broad-minded to the full range of economic possibilities. Maybe using data from a few decades in the middle of the 20th century to set policy in the 21st isn't actually a good idea.\n\nThe results of the last few years make you wonder whether we've been too pessimistic about just how hot the United States economy can run without inflation or other negative effects.\n\nThere are even early signs that the tight labor market may be contributing to, or at least coinciding with, a surge in worker productivity, which if sustained would fuel higher wages and living standards over time. That further supports the case for the Fed and other policymakers to let the expansion rip rather than trying to hold it back.\n\nIt's tough setting economic policy.

American officials have complained that Chinese negotiators have been playing a bait-and-switch, backing away from concessions they had agreed to.\n\nPresident Trump said the United States would raise its tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent on Friday, and begin taxing the remaining $325 billion of goods at that rate \"shortly.\" For a while, it was unclear whether negotiations would resume at all this week.\n\n[President Trump taunted China by tweet on Wednesday.]\n\nIf trade talks did disintegrate, even with the arrival of high-level Chinese officials in Washington, the economy would be in danger of experiencing a meaningful downturn and potentially a recession. Economists at Moody's Analytics, for example, expect it would subtract 1.8 percentage points from G.D.P. growth and cause unemployment to rise.\n\nIt would particularly hammer the financial results of some of the prominent American companies that either import Chinese goods or rely on the country as a major export market.\n\nYet the S&P 500 was down only 2.2 percent in the first three trading days of the week. The index has given up only about a month's worth of gains; markets were lower as recently as early April.\n\nThe answer to the puzzle lies in a few words: the Trump Put.\n\nA \"put\" is a type of option security that lets people put a floor under their losses. If you buy stock for $50 a share and also a put with a $40 strike price, you are protected from losing more than $10 per share.\n\nIn his 28 months in office, Mr. Trump has created a sense in markets that he will play that role for the economy as a whole. His administration has followed through on some of his threats -- applying tariffs on many steel and aluminum imports, the existing tariffs on Chinese imports that Mr. Trump threatened to expand on Sunday -- but has backed off whenever markets and the economy have looked soft.\n\nA prime example came late last year, with financial markets falling and the risk of recession rising. The emergence of constructive negotiations between American and Chinese officials -- in particular after a Feb. 22 Oval Office meeting -- was one factor in a rally that has driven stocks up 15 percent so far in 2019. The Federal Reserve's decision to back off plans for interest rate increases, as well as successful Chinese efforts to stimulate its economy, were other major factors.\n\nIf you're trying to bet on where markets will be six months or a year from now, there are a few things you know. The president of the United States cares a lot about what happens to the stock market, as his tweets make plain. He will be running for re-election in 18 months. He enjoys making big, bold promises, many of which don't materialize.\n\nThat adds up to a conviction that nothing really bad will happen -- that the administration will strike some kind of deal, even if it does little to address long-term economic tensions between the United States and China.\n\nThe only problem is that the existence of the Trump Put creates a funny circular system.\n\nPresident Trump is more confident in taking an aggressive negotiating stand because the stock market is up a lot this year and the American economy is looking solid. The perception of a Trump Put means that markets don't fall very much even with that tougher negotiating stand. But that, in turn, means a weaker signal to the president and his inner circle that there would be negative consequences if they followed through with the president's Twitter threats to place tariffs on all Chinese imports.\n\nWith China's vice premier, Liu He, set to come to Washington for two days of talks, there is plenty of incentive for both sides to reach a deal.\n\nBut the existence of the Trump Put seems to increase the odds of a miscalculation. The danger would be greater if the relatively muted market response to the threats of escalation caused Trump administration negotiators to believe his line that the United States economy was doing well because of tariffs (as Mr. Trump has tweeted) and not despite them (as almost all mainstream economists believe).\n\nIf that miscalculation happens and the Trump Put turns out to be less reliable than it appeared, we will most likely find ourselves in a more damaging sort of global trade war than anything we've seen up to this point.\n\nAnd that, in turn, could make the turbulence in markets this week seem downright quaint.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_irwin@nytimes.com", "name": "Neil Irwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/08/upshot/08up-markets/08up-markets-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800969", "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 296169420}, {"uri": "1141790166", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:17:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:17:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/upshot/us-china-trade-war.html", "title": "Why the U.S.-China Trade War Could Be Long and Painful: No Offramps", "body": "There's a shrinking supply of the 'constructive ambiguity' that would let each side present a deal as a win.\n\nJust two weeks ago, the United States and China seemed to be gliding toward a trade deal meant to resolve tensions between the world's two largest economies.\n\nBut the breakdown in talks since -- the United States raised tariffs to 25 percent on $200 billion of Chinese imports, for example, and is threatening to tax an additional $300 billion -- worries people who study international economic diplomacy.\n\nThat's because both the United States and China seem to be digging into their positions in ways that will be hard to resolve with the mutual face-saving that typically turns high-stakes negotiations into deals.\n\nTo use a common negotiating metaphor, it is not clear what the offramps might be that would allow a de-escalation and prevent a major trade war that would prove costly to both nations.\n\nIn effect, President Trump appears to view continuing tension with China as good for him politically and has said, contrary to the view of mainstream economists, that tariffs are a reason for the United States' recent economic good fortune.\n\nChina's leaders may not reveal their thinking in real time on Twitter, but they have signaled that many of the concessions the United States wants would require China to sacrifice core parts of its economic strategy and national sovereignty -- in particular its ambitions to lead in the high-tech industries of the future.\n\n\"Each side has dug itself into some fairly deep holes such that it will be difficult to emerge from,\" said Douglas Rediker, chairman of International Capital Strategies and a former U.S. representative to the International Monetary Fund. As is often the case in negotiations, the pathway to a deal may rest in a \"constructive ambiguity\" that both sides can present to their domestic audiences as a win.\n\n\"Do I believe there's enough room to find common ground?\" Mr. Rediker said. \"Yes, but only based on this ambiguity that doesn't necessarily resolve the issues in one party's favor or another.\"\n\nBoth sides have taken subtle steps to allow time for last-ditch efforts. China sent a senior negotiator to Washington last week despite the breakdown in talks, and it delayed the start of its retaliatory tariffs on American imports until June 1. The United States applied the newest wave of higher tariffs based on when ships containing the affected goods arrive, adding a few weeks in which a reversal could be hammered out.\n\nAnd President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China could meet at the G20 summit in late June in Osaka, Japan, which would be an opportunity for de-escalation at the highest levels.\n\nBut open lines of communication and time to work won't by themselves solve the problem of how to finesse some mutually agreeable deal, particularly given that both countries view this negotiation as resetting their economic relationship in ways that would have long-lasting consequences.\n\nAdd in Mr. Trump's tendency to view every negotiation through a zero-sum prism, and it may be hard to find a pathway for both parties to go home able to proclaim victory.\n\nWhen the negotiations seemed to be going well a few weeks ago, \"I thought we were going toward constructive ambiguity,\" said Mary E. Lovely, an economist and trade expert at Syracuse University's Maxwell School.\n\nThe United States is demanding that China codify rules into law to protect American companies (and their technology) that do business in China. Chinese negotiators now reject that possibility; American officials said they had agreed to those provisions.\n\n\"It looks like there was a level of specificity that China wasn't willing to accept and a level of ambiguity that the Trump administration wasn't willing to accept,\" Ms. Lovely said. \"It looks like the Chinese are firm that there are some areas where they are not willing to go, that they see as disrespectful.\"\n\nIf the escalation now being signaled by both sides goes into force, Americans will face higher prices for a wide range of goods, and certain American manufacturers will face less demand for their products. Already, American farmers are suffering amid reduced Chinese demand for soybeans and other products. The Chinese manufacturing sector is hurting as well -- and is likely to suffer further if tariffs reduce American demand for their products or drive relocation of production to other countries.\n\nUltimately the question becomes how much of that pain each side will be willing to endure, and whether the two nations' leaders feel a sense of urgency to each help the other save face domestically.\n\nThings can change quickly. In a different sphere, for example, Mr. Trump went from threatening North Korea with nuclear annihilation to acting as if they were old friends practically overnight.\n\nBut given where things stand, it may take that kind of surprising reset between two top leaders, built on personal relationships, rather than the slow grind of hammering out an agreement that is more typical of economic diplomacy.\n\n\"The off-ramps are tricky here because the president believes this is good policy, and the Chinese are loath to cave on it,\" said Jay Shambaugh, a professor of international economics at George Washington University and director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. \"It's not abundantly clear how you climb down without any damage.\"\n\nThe question for the weeks and months ahead is how much damage each side will tolerate before rethinking some of those basic assumptions and deciding that they don't want to dig in quite so hard, after all.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_irwin@nytimes.com", "name": "Neil Irwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/14/upshot/up-trade/up-trade-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 296169420}, {"uri": "1141767354", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "20:39:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T20:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/21/big-disconnect-economy-is-popular-trumps-economic-agenda-is-not/", "title": "Opinion | Big disconnect: The economy is popular. Trump's economic agenda is not.", "body": "(Kevin Dietsch/Pool via Bloomberg) By Greg Sargent Greg Sargent Opinion writer covering national politics Opinion writer May 21 at 4:11 PM\n\nAt his rally in Pennsylvania on Monday night, President Trump took special care to talk up his trade agenda, claiming that it has boosted jobs in the state and strengthened its steel industry. Trump's trade policies will of course be central to his reelection bid, which centers on holding the \"blue wall\" states he cracked -- Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\n\nIn Trump's mind, his trade agenda cannot be unpopular, because the economy is doing so well, and surely his policies are the sole reason for that. Which means he'll get reelected.\n\n\"When you have the best economy probably that we've ever had,\" Trump said, \"how the hell do you lose this election, right?\"\n\nIt's a good question. And the new Quinnpiac poll suggests one way it might happen.\n\nThe Quinnpiac poll finds shockingly good numbers on the economy. A total of 71 percent of voters say the economy is either \"excellent\" (22 percent) or \"good\" (49 percent). A majority -- 52 percent -- say they are better off financially today than they were in 2016.\n\nBut Trump's approval rating is only 38 percent, while 57 percent disapprove.\n\nA chorus of pundits will point out that this reflects disapproval of Trump on things that are unrelated to the economy, such as his racism, authoritarianism, and temperamental unfitness for the presidency, and surely there's a lot to that.\n\nBut the poll also raises the possibility that Trump's economic record may also be part of the problem. It finds that on his signature issues of trade and China, he's also under water:\n\nOnly 39 percent of voters approve of Trump's handling of trade, versus 53 percent who disapprove. Only 40 percent approve of the way Trump is handling the nation's policy towards China, versus 50 percent who disapprove. Only 40 percent say Trump's trade policies are good for the U.S. economy, versus 48 percent who say they're bad.\n\nThis might help explain why voters are so closely divided on whether they approve of Trump's overall handling of the economy, at 48 percent to 45 percent, even as they like the economy itself so much.\n\nAs it is, Trump might end up benefiting from the good economy to a lesser degree than he expects, even though the rule is supposed to be that good economies help incumbents. As Harry Enten recently explained, at no point throughout his presidency has Trump clearly benefited from the economy: Though we've had low unemployment and solid economic growth throughout, his approval rating has hovered at around 42 percent.\n\nBut in addition to this, it's also worth asking whether public assessments of Trump's economic policies may have come decoupled from public assessments of the economy's overall health and voters' sense of their own economic prospects.\n\nAfter all, Trump's economic agenda involves a fusion of conventional Republican policies with his \"America First\" trade agenda, which is supposed to represent a species of economic populism that broke with GOP orthodoxy. Under Trump, neither of these has been popular. Many recent polls have found that Trump's tax cut, which overwhelmingly benefited corporations and the wealthy, is under water.\n\nBut, in a bit of a surprise, the Trump economic policies that most prominently broke with GOP orthodoxy -- that is, on trade -- have also proven unpopular, as the new Quinnipiac poll demonstrates. We've seen Trump's trade wars have all kinds of negative effects, hitting his own constituencies particularly hard, even as a deal with China has proven more elusive than he expected.\n\nIt also seems plausible that public impressions of Trump's trade and China policies have become entangled with impressions of his \"America First\" nationalism. Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate deal and his disastrous immigration policies have also proved deeply unpopular.\n\nNow, ti's true that Trump mainly needs these policies to deliver him back the noncollege whites that powered his victory last time. The Quinnipiac poll does find that majorities of those voters do approve of Trump on trade and China, though they are surprisingly bare majorities, of around 54 percent or 55 percent.\n\nBut it turns out these policies are unpopular among the broader electorates in the industrial Midwest. Quinnpiac sent me the numbers on these policies in just that region -- Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Iowa -- and the results are:\n\nIn these five states, only 41 percent of voters approve of Trump's handling of trade, versus 56 percent who disapprove. In these five states, only 39 percent approve of the way Trump is handling the nation's policies towards China, versus 53 percent who disapprove. In these five states, only 39 percent say Trump's trade policies are good for the U.S. economy, versus 47 percent who say they're bad.\n\nThis mirrors a Post poll from July 2018, which found that only 39 percent of voters in that same region thought the tariff wars with China would be good for U.S. jobs, versus 59 percent who did not.\n\nOddly, despite all this, Democrats have if anything been surprisingly reluctant to take on Trump on trade and China. But that should change. Trump does not have magical political powers on these issues, even if the good economy seems to persuade him otherwise.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-AXF8CDLsUuyBiw1a1XtMdmMwss=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DDPY3YD36EI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4803492", "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 296167140}, {"uri": "1141717839", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "19:16:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T19:16:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4745098054409027, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/business/economy/trump-fed-judy-shelton.html", "title": "Trump Team Vets Fed Critic for Board Seat", "body": "The Trump administration is vetting Judy Shelton, a conservative economist and former Trump campaign adviser, for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board, according to people familiar with the matter, putting the longtime Fed critic one step closer to a leadership role at an institution she would like to drastically change.\n\nMs. Shelton, 64, was recently interviewed by Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, but has yet to meet with President Trump.\n\nIf nominated and confirmed, Ms. Shelton would take one of two open positions on the seven-member board of governors in Washington. Two of Mr. Trump's would-be nominees, Herman Cain and Stephen Moore, were withdrawn from consideration after Republican lawmakers made clear they would not support their nominations given concerns about their past treatment of, or statements about, women.\n\nMs. Shelton, now executive director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, previously advised Mr. Trump during his presidential campaign and served on his transition team. She has regularly praised Mr. Trump's economic policies, and now favors near-zero interest rates, a position likely to curry favor with a president who has called the central bank the \"biggest risk\" to the economy.\n\nIn an interview, Ms. Shelton criticized the Fed's current practice of paying interest on excess money that banks keep at the Fed as a way to set the Fed's policy rate. The approach, she said, encourages banks to hold money that they would otherwise lend out, since they are being paid to keep their money idle. To help \"phase out\" the practice, Ms. Shelton said, she would support gradually cutting interest rates back to rock-bottom. If that spurred inflation, Ms. Shelton said, she would want to sell off the Fed's holdings of Treasury securities and other government-backed bonds to keep prices from spiraling out of control.\n\n\"It's like paying the banks to do nothing,\" Ms. Shelton said of the current practice. Her plan would be \"effectively cutting interest rates, but not as a primary goal.\"\n\nMs. Shelton, who is friends with both Mr. Kudlow and Mr. Moore, has been a proponent of the White House's $1.5 trillion tax cut, deregulatory approach, and continuing trade war with China, which she calls \"uncomfortable\" but something \"we have to pursue.\"\n\n\"The policy changes, I think, are unleashing the potential for a high-growth, productive economy,'' she said.\n\nMs. Shelton could have an easier road to nomination than some of Mr. Trump's more recent picks. She was confirmed in March 2018 as head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, so she has already passed a government background check and made it through Senate Foreign Relations Committee vetting. If she is nominated, the Senate Banking Committee will hold her Fed confirmation hearing.\n\nStill, while four of Mr. Trump's Fed nominees were confirmed, his two most recent formal nominations -- Nellie Liang and Marvin Goodfriend -- were never cleared by lawmakers. And neither Mr. Moore, a political commentator, nor Mr. Cain, a former presidential candidate, was ever formally nominated after concerns about past issues surfaced.\n\nMs. Shelton would be an unconventional pick for the Federal Reserve's board of governors. Her preference for a linked currency -- one tied to gold or some other reference point, rather than simply backed by faith in the government -- would make her unique among her colleagues. She wrote in 2018 that \"we make America great again by making America's money great again.\"\n\nThat stance may appeal to Mr. Trump, who has fondly recalled the gold standard.\n\nShe has also been an outspoken opponent of the Fed, criticizing the central bank's policies as a driver of the 2008 financial crisis and its attempt to clean up the mess. \"No other government institution had more influence over the creation of money and credit in the lead-up to the devastating 2008 global meltdown,\" she wrote in The Wall Street Journal in April. \"And the Fed's response to the meltdown may have exacerbated the damage by lowering the incentive for banks to fund private-sector growth.\"\n\n\"She would bring a different voice, a different perspective,'' said James A. Dorn, vice president for monetary studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. \"Judy has been much more critical of the Fed than most of the people who are currently on the board.\"\n\nMs. Shelton holds a doctorate in business administration from the University of Utah and cut her teeth at the Hoover Institution from 1985 to 1995. She sat just down the hall from Milton Friedman, a conservative economist who developed important groundwork for modern monetary policy. Condoleezza Rice, who went on to be secretary of state under President George W. Bush, was another colleague.\n\nShe then made her way to Washington. She worked with Bob Dole's presidential campaign back in 1996. She spent much of the 2000s writing opinion pieces, serving on corporate boards and working with the National Endowment for Democracy, most recently as chairwoman.\n\nShe began the 2016 election cycle advising Ben Carson, but began advising Mr. Trump's campaign in August 2016, after she penned a Wall Street Journal opinion piece titled \"Trump's Contribution to Sound Money.\" Steven Mnuchin, now the Treasury secretary, called and asked her to join the cause, she said. She went on to work on the Trump transition team in a Treasury role.\n\nMs. Shelton has been married to Gilbert Shelton, a former banker and investor, for more than 40 years. Both she and her husband regularly donate to right-leaning candidates and organizations, records show.\n\nSince taking her post at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a multilateral institution founded in 1991 to help foster post-Cold War projects in Central and Eastern Europe, Ms. Shelton has continued to watch and praise Mr. Trump's actions. She has also remained critical of the Fed, both in her writings and in a recent interview.\n\n\"It's fair to challenge the models and practices of the Federal Reserve, and to say, 'Is this is the best we could do?'\" Ms. Shelton said. \"Central banks, to some extent, have been a demoralizing force for free markets.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeanna_smialek@nytimes.com", "name": "Jeanna Smialek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/21/business/21DC-FEDNOM-01/21DC-FEDNOM-01-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4801004", "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 296162160}, {"uri": "1141662069", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "17:49:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T17:49:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/21/farms-are-suffering-climate-change-trumps-trade-war-heres-how-help/", "title": "Opinion | Farms are suffering from climate change and Trump's trade war. Here's how to help.", "body": "A water-saturated cornfield in Churdan, Iowa, on May 17. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News) By Art Cullen May 21 at 1:06 PM\n\nArt Cullen is editor of the Storm Lake Times in Northwest Iowa and author of \"Storm Lake: A Chronicle of Change, Resilience, and Hope from a Heartland Newspaper.\"\n\nSTORM LAKE, Iowa\n\nPresident Trump's trade war with China is doing plenty of damage to farmers in this region, but it is also shining a harsh light on an agriculture industry that has been heading for a reckoning since the early 1970s.\n\nPresident Richard M. Nixon's detente with China started U.S. farmers on the path to becoming Beijing's agribusiness partners, ripping up the countryside and radically expanding pork operations to feed millions on the other side of the world.\n\nNearly half a century later, the results are plain to see. Iowa has about half the farmers it once did, with smaller producers squeezed out by the behemoths. The soil is eroding at alarming rates. Fertilizer pours into waterways, eventually draining into the Gulf of Mexico, creating a dead zone of oxygen deprivation the size of New Jersey. Rural areas are depopulating.\n\nFor decades, the markets have been telling us that we're growing too much corn and soybeans, but we wouldn't listen. The painful interruption in business-as-usual caused by the trade war presents an opportunity to rethink U.S. farming's dependence on Chinese buyers.\n\nOne serious, sensible step that would help set markets right and aid the environment: idling a third of Iowa's acres from corn and soy production.\n\n\"We've got all our eggs in one basket. This is a wake-up call to change agriculture,\" John Norris, former chief of staff to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in the Obama administration, told me recently. \"We're subsidizing cheap grain and cheap pork for China, and we keep farmers just afloat. The only ones benefiting are the traders, the seed and chemical companies, and the Chinese.\"\n\nIf the trade war doesn't get people's attention in farm country, the changing climate should. The Midwest was inundated by flooding this spring, again, as entire towns and tens of thousands of acres of cropland along the Missouri River were washed away. Not even half of Iowa's corn is planted -- a job that should have been finished weeks ago. Research from NASA and land-grant universities suggests that our corn yields could drop by half in the next 50 years because of climate change. Food production is imperiled unless we reroute.\n\nHow would idling the land from producing soybeans and corn work? Instead of writing a $15 billion check for trade-disaster aid -- as Trump promised this month, after a $12 billion aid infusion in the electorally crucial Midwest last year -- the government could put the money toward paying those farmers to capture carbon from the air and bury it in the soil by planting grass or small grains such as rye in rotation with corn.\n\nThe mechanism exists through the Conservation Stewardship Program, which pays farmers for conservation practices on working lands. It is funded at $12 billion over the next five years -- after suffering a $5 billion cut by Congress in the 2018 farm bill.\n\n\"Farmers always farm the program. They chase the money,\" Norris said. \"So let's farm a different program, one that actually benefits the land. When you add carbon to the soil, you improve yields. Farmers can make more money by building the soil through crop rotations and grazing.\"\n\nLet cattle roam on green hills again. Rural communities can recover if the air and water are clean and if small beef processors can reemerge, providing jobs to depopulating areas. It would help if Trump ended the steel tariffs that are driving up the cost of tractors and cutting into profits at John Deere, Caterpillar and Case IH.\n\nThe breadbasket of the Midwest can be protected by shifting funding from disaster aid and crop insurance to programs that actually benefit the public -- and farmers specifically. Better yet if there were a carbon market that rewarded farmers, ranchers and foresters, and could keep rural communities whole with new jobs in wind and solar.\n\nThe United States is at an inflection point brought by a trade war and climate change. We should seek free trade through patience and steady diplomacy, but we shouldn't bet the farm on agriculture exports. A better goal: establishing a network of diverse, resilient producers who provide global food security while reducing climate impacts.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta of the District of Columbia opened his 41-page opinion with a lengthy quote from Buchanan complaining, in 1860, about the House opening an investigation into him.\n\n\"He maintained that the House of Representatives possessed no general powers to investigate him, except when sitting as an impeaching body,\" Mehta noted. \"Buchanan feared that, if the House were to exercise such authority, it 'would establish a precedent dangerous and embarrassing to all my successors, to whatever political party they might be attached.' Some 160 years later, President Donald J. Trump has taken up the fight of his predecessor.\"\n\nFor Mehta to lead with Buchanan, and such an explicit comparison to the current occupant of the Oval Office, is the judicial equivalent of what kids call a sick burn. Mehta's opinion goes on to offer a meaty history lesson for a president who has never cared much for the discipline. The judge cites Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton as he outlines why the House is entitled to the records it seeks. After recounting the Whitewater, Watergate and Teapot Dome investigations, Mehta concludes: \"This court is not prepared to roll back the tide of history.\"\n\n-- By any metric, Buchanan was one of our worst presidents. He was elected president in 1856. In the 1858 midterms, Republicans won functional control of the House with a plurality. But Democrats still held the Senate and the White House and controlled the Supreme Court. Washington descended into a gridlock far worse than what we know now. Sectional differences splintered Democrats between the North and South. Faced with Abraham Lincoln's likely victory in 1860, the proslavery \"fire-eaters\" advocated secession. Buchanan took the position that states didn't have the legal right to secede, but that there was nothing the federal government could do legally to stop them. He allowed the country to fall apart with a policy of inactivity during the transition. It took Lincoln's heroic leadership, four years and countless casualties to put down the rebellion.\n\n-- In addition to being feckless, the Buchanan administration was corrupt. Jasmin Bath, a historian of 19th-century political and economic culture, wrote a piece for the Outlook section last week about the committee that Buchanan was so angry about: \"Without Pennsylvania, Buchanan would not have gained enough electoral votes to win. Knowing this, state Democrats did what they could to get Buchanan into the White House, including using federal funds to finance their campaign. Although this was not uncovered until four years later, suspicions of payoffs and fraud tainted Buchanan's victory. ...\n\n\"In March 1860, a congressional committee made up of three Republicans and two Democrats began investigating. Nicknamed the Covode Committee after its chairman, John Covode, it produced a detailed majority report that exposed the crimes of the Democratic Party and the president himself. The sheer volume of corruption uncovered was startling. Although there was not enough evidence to impeach Buchanan, the report exposed extensive corruption that took place during his presidency: bribery, the disfranchisement of some voters in federal elections, abuses of printing contracts, subsidies for partisan presses from public accounts. The list went on and on.\n\n\"The committee's findings were released to the public in June 1860, just months before the presidential election, and proved to be incredibly damaging to the Democratic Party's reputation, even though Buchanan was not running again. Its detailed accounts of the misdeeds of the Democratic administration, which circulated throughout the North, gave the Republican Party substantial evidence with which to persuade the public that the United States could not afford the continued reign of the 'rotten and dishonest' Democratic politicians.\n\n\"Many contemporaries believed the Covode report had an impact on the results of the election. According to one Democratic campaign manager, August Belmont, 'the country at large had become disgusted with the misrule of Mr. Buchanan, and the corruption which disgraced his Administration' and the 'Democratic party was made answerable for [Buchanan's] misdeeds, and change was ardently desired by thousands of conservative men out of politics.' Even Southerners agreed. One slaver owner, Sidney George Fisher, argued that 'the corruptions and excesses of the administration were very influential in producing Republican victory.'\"\n\n-- Mehta outlined how reviewing financial records fits \"comfortably\" within Congress's broad powers. He said the legislative branch serves an \"informing function\" that boils down to the ability to expose corruption in the other branches. \"It is simply not fathomable that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct -- past or present -- even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry,\" wrote Mehta, who was appointed by Barack Obama.\n\n-- Trump called the decision \"crazy\" and promised to challenge it. \"We think it's totally the wrong decision by, obviously, an Obama-appointed judge,\" he told reporters.\n\n-- The judge gave Trump one week to formally appeal. \"The President is subject to the same legal standard as any other litigant that does not prevail,\" he noted.\n\n-- The ruling came down shortly after the White House officially blocked former counsel Don McGahn from testifying to Congress, releasing a memo from a Trump appointee at the Justice Department to justify the decision. \"The 15-page legal opinion written by Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel argues McGahn cannot be compelled to testify before the committee, based on past Justice Department legal opinions regarding the president's close advisers,\" Rachael Bade, Josh Dawsey and Devlin Barrett report. \"The memo says McGahn's immunity from congressional testimony is separate and broader than a claim of executive privilege. ...\n\n\"As a private citizen no longer in the government, McGahn is not necessarily bound by the White House directive ... [but his] lawyer, William A. Burck, said the former counsel would not testify. 'Mr. McGahn remains obligated to maintain the status quo and will respect the President's instruction,' Burck wrote. Testifying could jeopardize business and professional standing for McGahn, who works for Jones Day, a Republican law firm with close ties to the Trump campaign and electoral politics. Jones Day will still be involved in the reelection campaign but will have a reduced role from 2016, campaign officials say, when they were the main firm.\"\n\n-- Nancy Pelosi repeatedly cited Mehta's opinion last night during private sessions aimed at discouraging members of her own leadership team from breaking with her publicly on impeachment in the face of Trump's stonewalling vis-a-vis McGahn. \"Today we won our first case,\" she told a group of House Democrats, according to someone in the room. \"We've been in this thing for almost five months, and now we're getting some results. ... We still have unexhausted avenues here.\"\n\nAfter meeting privately with Pelosi last night, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler also mentioned Mehta's ruling as a reason not to jump the gun on impeachment. \"We have to enforce the right to our testimony through the courts, which is the only way you can do it,\" the New York Democrat told reporters staking out the speaker's office. \"And, right now, we're having very good success with it.\"\n\nBut at least five members of Pelosi's leadership team -- four of whom also sit on the House Judiciary Committee -- pressed Pelosi in a closed-door leadership meeting to allow the panel to start an inquiry. Bade and Mike DeBonis report: \"The meeting marks the first time a chairman and top rank-and-file lawmakers ... have lobbied her to change her long-held position on impeachment. Judiciary Committee members for days have discussed how to move the speaker toward their thinking, but few have been willing to break with her publicly. However, a core group of Judiciary Democrats plans to begin calling Tuesday for an impeachment inquiry if [McGahn] does not show for subpoenaed testimony. ...\n\n\"During the Monday night leadership meeting, Pelosi spoke about how Democrats' messaging isn't breaking through because everyone is talking about corruption, [Bob] Mueller's report and impeachment. She bemoaned the fact that last week the investigations were making page one news while the House's passage of the Equality Act -- a bill aimed at ensuring that gay, lesbian and bisexual people are not discriminated against -- was on 'Page 26.' That's when Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), chairman of a Judiciary subcommittee, jumped in to tell Pelosi that it amounted to a good case for launching an impeachment inquiry ... Raskin argued that such an inquiry would allow leadership to streamline and centralize all of the investigations into one. ... 'You want to tell Elijah Cummings to go home?' Pelosi said, referring to the House Oversight and Reform Committee chairman. ...\n\n\"During the leadership meeting, three other Judiciary Committee members -- [Rep. David] Cicilline (D-R.I.), Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and freshman Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) -- backed Raskin. ... Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), a fierce Pelosi defender and ally, grew angry and scolded the lawmakers that an impeachment inquiry would further distract from legislating. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos (Ill.) -- who has argued before that legislators should move on from impeachment talk -- pushed back as well, noting that when the DCCC asked voters in focus groups what topics they cared about, Mueller's inquiry ranked near the bottom.\"\n\n-- Trump relishes a fight and loves a good foil. House Democrats give him both. With his refusal to give an inch, Trump seems to be trying to goad Democrats into taking the next step. The White House is currently blocking more than 20 Democratic investigations into Trump, his finances or his policies.\n\n-- Even if House Democrats do decide to begin impeachment proceedings, a key factor that protects the president from being removed from office is that only one Republican in either chamber of Congress appears anywhere close to advocating his removal from office. Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) drew a primary challenger yesterday after he became the first Republican member of Congress to say publicly that Trump has committed impeachable offenses. The Detroit Free Press's Todd Spangler reports: \"State Rep. Jim Lower, R-Greenville, announced that he would run for the 3rd Congressional District seat Amash has held since 2011 and would forgo a race for a third term in the state House. Lower said he had been planning to run for some time and had expected to make an announcement closer to July 4.\"\n\n-- Amash has put his fellow congressional Republicans in a pickle. DeBonis and Bade report: \"Top Republican lawmakers and aides said Monday that kicking Amash out of the GOP conference or off his committee would only draw more attention to his apostasy. Instead, they have focused on isolating Amash and portraying him as an outlier. The House Freedom Caucus, a conservative group of which Amash is a member, also took a position Monday night 'strongly disagreeing' with Amash's comments.\"\n\n-- Harry Reid, battling pancreatic cancer in Las Vegas, said he shares Pelosi's concerns about political backlash from impeachment. \"Because you don't have to go very far to remember what happened. I mean, Clinton was impeached -- it helped him. I've been saying that for several months,\" the former Senate majority leader told the New York Times's Jonathan Martin. He narrowly held off a challenge in 1998 from John Ensign by 428 votes, perhaps thanks to voter unease with the GOP impeaching Clinton.\n\n\"I believe Jerry Nadler is handling things the right way,\" the 79-year-old added. \"I think the Mueller report deserves a full airing, I think that there should be witnesses, and I think that Trump better be very careful. Because if they're going to order McGahn and Mueller and others not to testify, I think that opens the door to impeachment. ... [The] trigger point is if they try to not allow people to come forward and testify.\"\n\nTHE CASE IS NOT CLOSED:\n\n-- Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, told a House panel earlier this year that Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow encouraged him to lie under oath and claim that negotiations for Trump Tower Moscow ended in January 2016. Tom Hamburger, Ellen Nakashima and Karoun Demirjian report: \"In fact, Cohen later admitted, discussions on the Moscow tower continued into June of the presidential election year, after it was clear Trump would be the GOP nominee. ...\n\n\"House Democrats are now scrutinizing whether Sekulow or other Trump attorneys played a role in shaping Cohen's 2017 testimony to Congress. ... Attorneys for Sekulow said in a statement that 'Cohen's alleged statements are more of the same from him and confirm the observations of prosecutors in the Southern District of New York that Cohen's 'instinct to blame others is strong.' ...\n\n\"Cohen also said he spoke to Sekulow about a potential pardon 'quite a few' times 'before and after' his testimony to the committee. He said Sekulow didn't say directly that the president was considering giving him a pardon, but rather said 'there's always the possibility of a pre-pardon.'\"\n\n-- New York prosecutors are scrutinizing thousands of documents relating to Trump's inauguration. CNN's Kara Scannell reports: \"The President's Inaugural Committee handed over the cache of documents over the course of several weeks in response to a wide-ranging subpoena seeking documents, records, and communications concerning the inaugural's finances, vendors, and donors sent in February by the US attorney's office with the Southern District of New York. The last set of documents was produced within the last month. The end of the document production indicates the investigation is moving into the next stage.\"\n\n-- Sweden formally issued an extradition request for Julian Assange. The WikiLeaks founder is serving time in Britain for skipping bail, but he's wanted in Stockholm to face sexual assault charges. This could set off a tug of war between Sweden and the United States, which wants Assange extradited on allegations of conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer. (AP)\n\n-- Russians seeking to interfere in U.S. elections strategized about how to sow racial discord here as recently as last year, according to newly obtained documents. NBC News's Richard Engel, Kate Benyon-Tinker and Kennett Werner report: \"Communications between associates of Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Kremlin-linked oligarch indicted by [Mueller] for previous influence operations against the U.S. ... laid out a new plot to manipulate and radicalize African-Americans. The plans show that Prigozhin's circle has sought to exploit racial tensions well beyond Russia's social media and misinformation efforts tied to the 2016 election. ... One document said that [Trump's] election had 'deepened conflicts in American society' and suggested that, if successful, the influence project would 'undermine the country's territorial integrity and military and economic potential.'\"\n\nTHE RULE OF LAW:\n\n-- At a rally in Pennsylvania last night, Trump criticized Hillary Clinton. When the crowd began chanting \"Lock her up,\" the president replied: \"We have a great new attorney general who's going to give it a very fair look.\"\n\n-- That attorney general, Bill Barr, insisted in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he's fighting more to protect the institution of the presidency than Trump personally. The Journal's Sadie Gurman reports: \"'I felt the rules were being changed to hurt Trump, and I thought it was damaging for the presidency over the long haul,' Mr. Barr said. ... 'At every grave juncture the presidency has done what it is supposed to do, which is to provide leadership and direction,' he said in an interview. 'If you destroy the presidency and make it an errand boy for Congress, we're going to be a much weaker and more divided nation.' ... Many current and former law-enforcement officials have come to view Mr. Barr skeptically, citing his newly launched review of the investigation's origins and what he termed 'spying' on Trump campaign associates over ties to Russians. He hasn't explained what specifically prompted his concerns.\"\n\n-- Trump also called for the government to investigate Joe Biden's son, Hunter, over his business deals in China during an interview that aired Sunday on Fox News. It's a fresh illustration of the president's personal disdain for the rule of law. The Times's Maggie Haberman, Annie Karni, Ken Vogel and Katie Benner report: \"It was the latest in a long series of statements by Mr. Trump suggesting he would like to see criminal investigations of opponents including Clinton, John Kerry and the Democratic National Committee, and it came as the president seems particularly preoccupied by Mr. Biden's candidacy. ... 'It's a terrible breach of norms for the president to publicly advocate prosecutions of his opponents,' said Jack Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School who was an assistant attorney general during President George W. Bush's first term.\"\n\n-- At his rally in Pennsylvania last night, Trump prosecuted an economic case against Joe Biden. Anne Gearan reports from Montoursville, Pa.: \"The president touted an economic turnaround on his watch, saying Pennsylvania now has historically low unemployment that no political competitor could best. 'Sleepy Joe said that he's running to, quote, \"save the world,\"' Trump said to laughter from supporters. 'Well, he was: He was going to save every country but ours!' Trump's 'Make America Great Again' rally at an airport hangar in this small north-central Pennsylvania town was nominally a show of support for Republican state Rep. Fred Keller, the heavy favorite in a special election Tuesday to fill the congressional seat vacated in January by Tom Marino, a Republican who had just been reelected to his fifth term. ...\n\n\"Trump called a pan-Asia trade deal backed by Biden 'a disaster' for Pennsylvania and singled out remarks Biden recently made about charting a new course with China. Biden has staked much of his early campaign message on the theory that he can deny Trump a repeat victory here. A native of working-class Scranton, more than an hour to the east, Biden inaugurated his 2020 campaign in Pennsylvania and is using Philadelphia as his campaign headquarters. 'Biden deserted you,' Trump said. 'I guess he was born here, but he left you, he left you for another state.'\"\n\n-- Trump remains incredibly popular among blue-collar white workers in northeast Ohio, even though his presidency has not reversed the region's economic decline. The Times's Trip Gabriel has great reporting from the ground: \"The loss of 1,600 jobs in March at a General Motors plant in Lordstown, despite Mr. Trump's visible efforts to save them, was the latest blow. But even though stresses on families and communities are already acute, Mr. Trump appears to have lost little of his blue-collar support here. It is a sign of how tight a bond he has with voters who were once staunch Democrats, in an allegiance as much cultural as economic. But it also undermines the argument of [Biden] that he would be the best nominee to win back Midwest states because of his own appeal to working-class voters.\"\n\n-- Trump is preparing for a jet-setting summer of international travel to show stature on the world stage. The AP's Zeke Miller and Jill Colvin report: \"Four days in Tokyo. Then it's off to see Queen Elizabeth before a jaunt to Normandy, France, and perhaps time in Ireland. A return trip to Japan? Why not. And throw in Seoul. Then it's back to France for Trump for a summit with world leaders. ... The flurry of international travel is a marked change of pace for a president who likes to sleep in his own bed and rarely strays far from the White House unless it's to his own properties. The packed calendar is the product of both a concerted attempt by Trump to wrap himself in the trappings of the presidency heading into re-election season and a fluke of the global summit calendar.\"\n\n-- Despite his role as commander in chief, Trump continues to tweet out his thoughts about the 2020 Democrats like the country's \"narrator in chief.\" Ashley Parker and Robert Costa have a smart piece on how the president is always in your head, no matter if you love him or hate him: \"Trump in recent weeks has weighed in on actor Jussie Smollett's case in Chicago ('It is an embarrassment to our Nation!'), instructed the French government on how to fight the fire that engulfed Paris's Notre Dame Cathedral ('flying water tankers'), and disparaged what he viewed as the 'political correctness' of the Kentucky Derby ('It was a rough & tumble race on a wet and sloppy track'). ... Trump's naked eagerness to make any story or occasion about himself stems from his self-conception as both a star and a producer, a director and a writer, according to friends, advisers and critics. And now, they say, he is able to deploy the platform of the presidency to amplify that vision of himself as a leading man.\"\n\nEARTH IN THE BALANCE:\n\n-- The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution, which would make it easier to roll back key climate change rules. The Times's Lisa Friedman reports: \"The new analytical model would significantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted. ... The five people familiar with the plan, all current or former E.P.A. officials, said the new modeling method would appear in the agency's analysis of the final version of the replacement regulation, known as the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which is expected to be made public in June.\"\n\n-- The EPA is also cutting off funding for several research centers that study the effects of pollution on childhood development. Greenwire's Corbin Hiar and Ariel Wittenberg report: \"The move, critics say, is part of a broader effort by [Trump] to downplay science that could lead to stricter regulations on polluting industries. At issue are 13 Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Centers located at institutions across the country.\"\n\n-- The U.S. government put nuclear waste under a dome in the Marshall Islands. It is now cracking open. The president of the islands, Hilda Heine, is concerned that there's a risk of radioactive materials leaking. (Kyle Swenson)\n\n-- Bayer, Monsanto's new parent company, is facing thousands of new Roundup cancer lawsuits after a $2 billion judgment. Bayer plans on appealing the verdict, which awarded $1 billion each to a couple diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after they used the Roundup herbicide for years. (NBC News)\n\nTHE CHINA THREAT:\n\n-- Chinese leaders are preparing their citizens for a drawn-out trade war with Trump by evoking past battles with the Americans, including their assistance to North Korea during the 1950s. Anna Fifield reports: Chinese President Xi Jinping, \"accompanied by his top trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, on Monday placed a floral basket at a monument in Jiangxi province commemorating the start of the Long March in 1934. In the 4,000-mile, year-long trek, the Communists broke through Nationalist lines, eventually ousting them and installing Mao Zedong as leader of China. Meanwhile, China's main movie channel, CCTV-6, has scrapped its regular programming in favor of films about the Korean War, which ended in a draw after China intervened to fight back the Americans.\"\n\n-- U.S. technology companies started curbing sales to the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. Jeanne Whalen, Greg Bensinger, Ellen Nakashima and Hamza Shaban report: \"Google said it would restrict Huawei's access to future updates of its Android operating software, which powers many of Huawei's phones. Other U.S. manufacturers also began suspending business dealings with the Chinese firm. The markets punished many of those suppliers Monday, including Intel, Broadcom and Qualcomm, as well as Micron and semiconductor manufacturer Cypress. ... On Monday evening, the Commerce Department slightly eased the timing of the restrictions, saying it would allow some transactions to continue for 90 days, to facilitate 'certain activities necessary to the continued operations of existing networks and to support existing mobile services.'\"\n\n-- Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei said the confrontation between the U.S. and China that he's been caught up in was \"inevitable.\" He also said U.S. trade restrictions will not deter Huawei's 5G expansion plans. (South China Morning Post)\n\n-- Morgan Stanley said the collapse of U.S.-Chinese trade talks could push the global economy toward a recession. \"If talks stall, no deal is agreed upon and the U.S. imposes 25% tariffs on the remaining circa $300 billion of imports from China, we see the global economy heading towards recession,\" the bank's analysts said in a note. They added that such circumstances would force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates back to zero within a year. (Reuters)\n\n-- A Ukrainian aircraft engine factory has become the Chinese military's new cash-hungry partner. Anton Troianovski reports: \"The president of a top Ukrainian aerospace company says its new Chinese investors often ask the staff for 'little conversations.' They want to know about record-keeping and planning, the setup of production lines and the interplay between workshops. 'They'll talk for three hours, and the next day, a totally different group of people will come,' said Vyacheslav Boguslayev, whose sprawling Soviet-era company, Motor Sich, is one of the most advanced military aircraft engine manufacturers in the world. ... Racing to upgrade its military, China has been turning to Ukraine. And Ukraine -- with its economy scrambled by hostilities with Russia -- has been willing to accept China's embrace.\"\n\n-- The Department of Homeland Security warned that Chinese-made drones may be sharing sensitive flight data with their manufacturers. An alert from DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warns that the drones \"contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.\" (CNN)\n\n-- Detainees in China's reeducation camps for Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang are given an hour or so to cry every two weeks, according to a woman who was held at one of the facilities. From Radio Free Asia: \"Since April 2017, authorities in the XUAR have held an estimated 1.5 million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities accused of harboring 'strong religious views' and 'politically incorrect' ideas in the camps ... Reporting ... has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination [and] routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers ... Guzire Awulqanqizi, a Kazakh woman who was held at the Dongmehle Re-education Camp [said] that detainees dealing with the stress of 14-hour days of political study are given a 'crying session' every two weeks.\"\n\nTHE IMMIGRATION WARS:\n\n-- Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state who blew a totally winnable governor's race last fall because of his polarizing approach, gave the White House a detailed list of 10 demands for him to become Trump's \"immigration czar.\" The Times's Maggie Haberman and Annie Karni scoop: \"Access to a government jet 24 hours a day. An office in the West Wing, plus guaranteed weekends off for family time. And an assurance of being made secretary of homeland security by November. Those were among a list of 10 conditions ... Kobach also said he would need to be the main television spokesman for the Trump administration on immigration policy. And he said he wanted a guarantee that cabinet secretaries whose portfolios relate to immigration would defer to him, with the president mediating disputes if need be. The list was submitted by Mr. Kobach in recent weeks as he discussed his interest in the job. Other conditions included having a staff of seven reporting to him, 'walk in' privileges to the Oval Office, a security detail if deemed necessary and the title of assistant to the president. ... The existence of the list has become known among officials in the Trump administration, some of whom were taken aback by what they regard as its presumptuousness. Mr. Trump has also been considering others for the role, and he is said to be leaning toward Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the former Virginia attorney general. Mr. Cucinelli has made his own requests related to the job, such as a security detail and transportation to work.\"\n\n-- A 16-year-old Guatemalan boy detained at the southern border died while in U.S. custody in Texas. Abigail Hauslohner reports: \"Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez was found unresponsive in his detention cell 'during a welfare check' Monday, a day after a nurse practitioner had diagnosed him with Influenza A and Border Patrol officials had moved to isolate him from other detained migrants, a CBP official told reporters during a conference call. ... He is the fifth migrant child since December to die after being taken into custody at the southern border by federal immigration authorities.\"\n\n-- New documents show that immigrants detained by ICE are sometimes placed in solitary confinement for reasons unrelated to rule violations. NBC News's Hannah Rappleye, Andrew W. Lehren, Spencer Woodman and Vanessa Swales report: \"The newly-obtained documents paint a disturbing portrait of a system where detainees are sometimes forced into extended periods of isolation for reasons that have nothing to do with violating any rules. ... Only half of the cases involved punishment for rule violations. The other half were unrelated to disciplinary concerns -- they involve the mentally ill, the disabled or others who were sent to solitary largely for what ICE described as safety reasons.\"\n\n-- Meanwhile, down under, Australia's reelection of its conservative government has triggered a spate of suicide attempts among the country's refugees. From France 24: \"Many had prayed for a more lenient policy from Labor, who had been strongly tipped to win. But an unexpected victory by Scott Morrison's centre-right coalition ... dashed hopes and set off a wave of self-harm including several hospitalisations.\"\n\nALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN AND WOMEN:\n\n-- George Papadopoulos, a member of Trump's 2016 campaign, is a perfect metaphor for 2019. T.A. Frank profiles him for this Sunday's Washington Post Magazine: \"I first met George Papadopoulos, the unlikely trigger of an investigation that many thought would take down Donald Trump, on a balmy California day in December 2018, less than a week after his release from federal prison. ... His 12 days in prison, he said, were worst before the fact. The reality of minimum-security confinement came as a relief. 'You're expecting you're going in to get raped and killed,' he said. 'I get inside the prison, and the guards are basically mocking my sentence: 'You're more trouble for us than we are for you.'\u2009' ... In person, he came across as warm, oddly guileless and eager to please. He made boastful claims. ('I was on a first-name basis with Netanyahu for four years.') He made ingratiating claims. ('As an individual I'm more comfortable with Washington Post people like you than with, I dunno, the Daily Caller.') And then there was his central claim: that the entire federal investigation of Trump had its origins in dirty tricks masterminded by a group of foreign and U.S. intelligence entities.\"\n\n-- \"Fox & Friends\" co-host Pete Hegseth privately lobbied Trump to pardon U.S. servicemen accused and convicted of war crimes. Hegseth, an Iraq War veteran, has pressed the president to pardon the men since as early as January. (The Daily Beast)\n\n-- Former Trump associate Roger Stone wants a judge's permission to appear at a strip club in Tennessee where he is scheduled to judge a national exotic dancer competition. Mother Jones's Dan Friedman reports: \"On Thursday, lawyers for Roger Stone, whose travel is restricted ahead of his November trial on obstruction of justice and perjury charges, requested a judge's permission to visit Tennessee and Illinois 'for business opportunities.' ... In a Facebook post, the club said Stone will judge dancers alongside Kristin Davis, who is known as the 'Manhattan Madam' for her role running a high-end prostitution ring in New York City in the early 2000s. Stone has previously employed Davis, and they are close friends. ... Last week, he launched a 'Family Support Fund' to seek donations to cover 'rent, food, medical expenses, insurance, gasoline, and the most basic of living expenses' for him and his wife. Strip-club appearance fees may be an emerging source of income for the cash-strapped dirty trickster.\"\n\n-- Education Secretary Betsy DeVos used her personal email to conduct government business. Laura Meckler reports: \"The report found fewer than 100 emails sent or received to personal accounts between Jan. 20, 2017 ... and April 10, 2018. It said most messages were in the first six months of 2017, from a single writer offering advice on potential candidates for agency positions. The writer, who was not identified, also included other department employees on his or her messages, using their official government email addresses. ... The report also flagged the department's failure to produce emails from DeVos's private accounts in response to one request under the Freedom of Information Act. ... A department spokeswoman, Liz Hill, did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but she said on Twitter that any coverage of the matter was overblown.\"\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Iran has quadrupled its uranium-enrichment production capacity. The AP's Nasser Karimi and Jon Gambrell report: \"Iranian officials made a point to stress that the uranium would be enriched only to the 3.67% limit set under the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, making it usable for a power plant but far below what's needed for an atomic weapon.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By Philip Bump Philip Bump National correspondent focused largely on the numbers behind politics May 20 at 12:56 PM\n\nCentral to President Trump's appeal for much of his base is the hard line he takes on immigration. From the first minutes of his campaign launch announcement in June 2015, Trump excoriated illegal immigration and embraced the idea that one of the key priorities for the next president should be to crack down on those in the country illegally.\n\nOver and over during the 2016 campaign, while his immigration rhetoric solidified a lead in the Republican primaries and into the general election, Trump reminded voters that he planned to focus on illegal immigration as president. In particular, he would point to a system called E-Verify. E-Verify allows employers to check information provided by employees with government records to establish whether the employees are allowed to work in the United States.\n\nThe checks are conducted online, as shown below.\n\nDuring a town-hall event in March 2016, MSNBC's Chris Matthews asked Trump about his plan to address the hiring of undocumented workers.\n\n\"Well, you can do that with E-Verify and the various methods,\" Trump told Matthews. He told Matthews that the Trump Organization used the system, which, The Post would later report, wasn't universally true. The punishment for hiring an undocumented worker? Trump proposed that it should be \"a huge financial penalty\" -- or perhaps a criminal penalty.\n\nAgain, it was of a piece with his broader rhetoric: Immigrants should be dissuaded from entering the country illegally and there should be efforts to curtail their ability to work in the United States to tamp down on illegal immigration. Among the changes the administration implemented to the immigration system last month was a tightening of rules on obtaining work permits.\n\nIt was a bit incongruous, then, that Trump said in an interview on Fox News Sunday that there might be some exceptions made. Trump was asked by the network's Steve Hilton whether E-Verify would be part of the proposed immigration overhaul Trump unveiled in vague terms last week.\n\n\"E-Verify is going to be possibly a part of it,\" Trump replied. \"The one problem is E-Verify is so tough that in some cases, like farmers, they're not -- they're not equipped for E-Verify. I mean, I'd say that's against Republicans. A lot of the Republicans say you go through an E-Verify.\"\n\nTrump said he used it during construction at the Trump Organization hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue -- a project that The Post found probably included undocumented workers. They'd go through some 30 applicants before they found one who was eligible to work in the country, Trump said.\n\n\"So it's a very tough thing to ask a farmer to go through that,\" Trump said. \"So in a certain way, I speak against myself, but you also have to have a world of some practicality.\"\n\nIt's an interesting shift in Trump's rhetoric. It's probably not unexpected; there have been numerous stories about farmers who have expressed concern about their ability to bring in their crops without the use of undocumented labor.\n\nA 2015 report from Pew Research Center found that only 5 percent of immigrants in the country illegally worked in agriculture, more than twice the rate of employment among U.S.-born workers. But some 16 percent of workers in the industry were undocumented, Pew estimated.\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe next most densely populated industries? Construction at 12 percent and leisure and hospitality at 9 percent. Both industries are ones in which the Trump Organization is active, from constructing or refurbishing facilities such as the Trump hotel in Washington to staffing his resorts and golf courses. Last year, The Post reported that the Trump Organization had begun cracking down on undocumented employees at its facilities.\n\nSo why now? Why is Trump willing to give farmers a pass on this issue that was so central to his campaign?\n\nOne likely reason is that Trump's trade war with China has had broad negative ramifications for U.S. agriculture. After the administration imposed a number of new tariffs on products from China, China retaliated by adding a tax on imports of U.S. goods, including products such as soybeans. In an effort to lighten the effect of the trade war, the government has paid affected farmers more than $8.5 billion to offset their losses.\n\nIt's a moment, in other words, when Trump's actions have hurt farmers, an effect that ripples through the largely rural communities where agriculture is dominant -- and which heavily voted for Trump in 2020. With his reelection looming, there's a political incentive for Trump to refrain from adding other burdens to these communities.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump specifically suggested that farmers who needed workers to, say, pick grapes (as at the Trump winery in Virginia) could bring people in on work visas -- an obviously more complicated process than verifying employment through E-Verify. (Trump Organization properties have often used work visas to hire as well.)\n\nNow, though, his tune has changed. During 2016, his hard line on immigration resonated with his base of voters.

May 20 at 11:54 AM\n\nIn a recent episode of \"The Daily,\" two American producers -- one a farmer, the other a manufacturer of sanitation trucks -- explained how President Trump's trade war is seriously hurting their businesses. Yet both continue to support his efforts, because they say the rationale for the trade war is justified.\n\nIn fact, while there's been ample criticism of how Trump is going about it, the notion that China must be penalized for its violations of international trade rules -- intellectual property transfers as a condition of joint ventures, subsidizing state industries, blocking American companies from parts of their market -- is widely held across both political parties and most of economics. Almost no one questions whether this is a legitimate reason to wage a trade war.\n\nThis is a mistake: The entire rationale may be misguided. If so, it won't help American workers, and as a protectionist effort, its costs to people across the globe could swamp its benefits.\n\nOur objections to intellectual property transfers must be viewed, as economist Dean Baker has argued, from the perspective of those for whom the trade war is allegedly being waged: American workers hurt by globalization. But to insulate American multinationals from China's practices in this area won't help those workers, as it will incentivize more, not less, offshoring of production. But because technology transfers threaten the profits of these companies, forcing China to stop insisting on them lowers the cost to the companies of producing abroad.\n\nIn a similar vein, Baker asks who benefits from protecting \"our\" intellectual property? \"It is not 'our' intellectual property that Trump is protecting. After all, very few people have any patents or copyrights that we are worried about China using without compensation. The intellectual property that Trump and his allies across the political spectrum want to protect belongs to major corporations like Boeing, Pfizer, and Microsoft. Their goal is to make China pay more money to get access to technology these companies have developed. That's great for their profits -- sort of like Trump's tax cut -- but does not help the vast majority of people.\"\n\nIn other words, protecting the copyrights and patents of multinationals makes them richer, while again, smoothing their path to producing abroad (relatedly, the notion that our patent system is doing more harm than good has been gaining ground). Is it really worth fighting a trade war, with all its collateral damage, on their behalf?\n\nNext, consider our objection to China's subsidies to their companies. In American policy parlance, this practice is derided as the government, as opposed to the market, \"picking winners.\" As such, it is widely considered a recipe for inefficiency, waste, weak innovation and corruption. Why start a trade war over a practice that our markets-know-best model tells us will hurt those who foolishly ply it? To do so seems to admit \"We can't compete with you if you're picking winners.\" Given that this stance implicitly endorses socialism over capitalism, it's an especially ironic one for the Trump administration to take.\n\nThere are valid counterarguments. State subsidies can distort global markets by allowing the subsidizer to corner global market share, even if they're not the most productive producer. The theft of Intellectual property vs. its voluntary transfer (remember, these companies choose to agree to China's joint venture conditions), should be prosecuted, and victims should be compensated. Neither should we accept currency manipulation, inhumane labor practices and human rights violations. To the contrary, as the world's dominant economy, we have an obligation to stand up to such practices.\n\nBut none of that requires us to accept the growing tensions, chaos and potential geopolitical realignments that may well result from this trade war. In fact, as economist Yukon Huang argues in a recent New York Times op-ed: This trade war with China is \"not really about trade.\" It's about the objection of our political leaders and industrialists to a different economic model than our own.\n\nEven if they agree with that conclusion, some will argue: So what? Whatever the motivation, the fact that China's \"eating our lunch\" is cause for pushback, and Team Trump is engaging in a lot more pushback than any of his predecessors.\n\nThe problem with that response is twofold. First, it's not going to help American workers. To the contrary, by incentivizing more offshoring, it's going to hurt them. Second, it is protectionism, which is one reason I'm surprised so many mainstream economists support these efforts. In contrast, Huang makes a compelling case that we should welcome the diffusion of technology and rise of emerging economies. That's what globalization is supposed to be about!\n\nIn that regard, our trade stance should be one of openness, fairness and the recognition that other models of growth must be allowed to have their turn on the global stage.

May 20 at 11:20 AM\n\nBEIJING -- China's government looks to be settling in for a long trade war with the United States, with President Xi Jinping invoking one of the Communist Party's most epic -- and ultimately successful -- battles.\n\nThe Chinese leader, accompanied by his top trade negotiator, vice premier Liu He, on Monday placed a floral basket at a monument in Jiangxi province commemorating the start of the Long March in 1934. In the 4,000-mile, year-long trek, the Communists broke through Nationalist lines, eventually ousting them and installing Mao Zedong as leader of China.\n\nMeanwhile, China's main movie channel, CCTV-6, has scrapped its regular programming in favor of films about the Korean War, which ended in a draw after China intervened to fight back the Americans.\n\n\"We are echoing the present times using the art form of film,\" the channel said, explaining its sudden schedule changes.\n\nThe planned coverage of the Asian Film Awards was ditched Friday for the classic war movie \"Heroic Sons and Daughters,\" the story of Chinese \"volunteer troops,\" who helped North Korea fight against the Americans in the 1950s.\n\nThen, over the weekend, came three more movies about resisting the United States: \"Battle on Shangganling Mountain\" and \"Surprise Attack.\" Another classic, the 1960 film \"Guards on the Railway Line,\" about Chinese scouts rooting out spies who work for the Americans, was due to screen Monday night.\n\nThe trade war reminds many Chinese of the1950-53 Korean War, when the two sides talked about a cease-fire for two years while continuing to fight, Xu Hailin, a commentator for the provocative nationalist tabloid the Global Times wrote in a column published Monday.\n\n\"The Chinese people's memories of engaging in talks and fights at same time remains fresh,\" he wrote. \"It let Chinese people realize that the trade frictions between China and the U.S. will not end very soon.\"\n\n[Are the U.S. and China heading for a deal -- or a divorce? ]\n\nEarlier this year, the state-run People's Publishing House printed \"Rereading On Protracted War,\" an updated collection of speeches that Mao gave in 1938 amid a Japanese invasion that would take eight years for China to repel. It appeared to be a sign that authorities were preparing the people for a long and difficult trade war.\n\nAll this propaganda has a purpose, said Dali Yang, professor of political science at the University of Chicago. \"The psychological aspect cannot be overestimated. The Chinese side wants to be seen as standing up to the U.S.,\" he said. \"They have to put on a strong face.\"\n\nYang recalled that in the 1990s, CCTV-6 had been playing movies about its old ally, Yugoslavia, and that these had infused the social atmosphere. After the American bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade in 1999, \"the students had been primed for action by these movies that had been playing,\" he said, noting that it was entirely coincidental but nonetheless extremely effective.\n\nTens of thousands of Chinese, including students, took to the streets to protest the United States, pelting its embassy in Beijing with eggs and bricks, and even 20 years on, many Chinese say it was not an accident, as the United States and NATO insisted.\n\nThe Communist Party does, however, have to strike a careful balance. It apparently wants to unify the populace against the United States, but not so much that students pour back out onto the streets. It's only two weeks until the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, and authorities have already clamped down on movement in Beijing and commentary online.\n\n[Graphic: The first round of China tariffs already stifled U.S. exports ]\n\nStill, over the past week, anti-American propaganda has intensified in Chinese state media. The slogan \"Want to talk? Let's talk. Want to fight? Let's do it. Want to bully us? Dream on!\" went viral on Chinese social media, according to What's on Weibo, a website that monitors China's answer to Twitter.\n\nAll of this is a sharp turnaround from the days after President Trump tweeted that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10 to 25 percent in response to China \"reneging\" on commitments made to seal a trade deal and end their year-long tariff war.\n\nThen, the state media was slow to report on the U.S. tariffs, waiting more than 24 hours to mention the threats -- and reporting them only once the Chinese authorities were ready to response.\n\nNow, the Chinese media is full of fighting talk.\n\nWhen the news broke that Washington was hiking tariffs again, Chinese netizens overwhelmingly agreed with authorities: \"If you want to talk, the door is open; if you want to fight, we will fight to the end,\" Xinhua reported.\n\nA former vice minister of commerce, Wei Jianguo, had previously said that China had not only the determination but also the willingness to fight a prolonged war. \"China will not only act as a kung fu master in response to U.S. tricks, but also as an experienced boxer and can deliver a deadly punch at the end,\" he told the South China Morning Post.\n\nIn a sign that nerves are running high, news websites appeared to accidentally re-send a Xinhua alert from May 20 last year, declaring \"China-U.

(J. Lawler Duggan for The Washington Post) By Jeanne Whalen Jeanne Whalen Reporter covering business around the world May 17 at 9:03 AM\n\nLORTON, Va. -- Maxsa Innovations, a small business selling electronic gadgets on the outskirts of Washington, was already reeling from the U.S.-China trade war when it realized it had a third superpower to manage: Amazon.\n\nMaxsa, which manufactures many of its products in China, had to start paying 25 percent more to import some goods after the United States introduced tariffs on Chinese-made products last summer. Faced with higher costs, Maxsa says it managed to persuade several small U.S. retailers to pay roughly 20 percent more for the company's wares.\n\nBut its biggest customer, Amazon, drove a much harder bargain.\n\nAmazon, which buys products from Maxsa and then sells them to consumers, initially rejected Maxsa's attempt to charge more for a laser-guided parking aid called Park Right, forcing Maxsa to cut off sales to the online retailer. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\n\"Please do what you can to help get this through,\" Maxsa founder Skip West pleaded in a January email to Amazon, part of an exchange reviewed by The Post. \"I felt horrible turning down $18,000 in orders this week.\"\n\nAs President Trump ramps up his trade war with China, other consumer-product companies report similar struggles getting big retailers to budge.\n\nWith the Internet driving ruthless price competition among Amazon, Walmart, Home Depot and others, large retailers are loath to pay more or to raise their own prices. That leaves importers of Chinese goods caught between the trade war and Americans' quest for the best possible deal.\n\n\"Retailers are all about everyday low prices. They want to protect consumers, but they also want to protect their sales,\" said Jason Trice, president of Jasco Products, a lighting and electronics seller in Oklahoma City. \"The Walmarts of the world don't just roll over.\"\n\n[Trump's tariffs, once described as negotiating tools, may be here to stay]\n\nSmall and midsize manufacturers without much ability to negotiate price increases with retailers and distributors say they have been absorbing much of the tariff costs themselves.\n\nJasco, a third-generation family-run business that designs products in the United States and manufactures in China, has had to cut in half monthly bonus payments to its 400 employees and donate less to charity, Trice said. Until last week, Jasco was facing 10 percent tariffs on goods representing 80 percent of its sales. Then President Trump raised those tariffs to 25 percent.\n\nMan & Machine, a Landover, Md., seller of waterproof computer keyboards, is cutting one workday out of every two weeks to avoid laying people off. \"I said, 'We're not going to meet payroll if we keep going like this,'\u2009\" said founder and chief executive Clifton Broumand.\n\nScosche Industries, an Oxnard, Calif., electronics maker, says tariffs cost the company about half of its profits last year. Profit-sharing payments to employees have fallen to close to zero, and the company is desperately attempting to shift production from China to Vietnam, chief executive Roger Alves said.\n\nAfter two months of negotiation, Amazon agreed to pay Maxsa 5.5 percent more for three versions of Park Right -- a device that attaches to a garage ceiling and beams a laser to a fixed spot below, helping people park in tight spaces.\n\n\"Companies of all sizes throughout the supply chain are adjusting to increased costs resulting from new tariffs,\" Amazon said in an emailed statement. \"We're working closely with our vendors to try to make this adjustment as smooth as possible.\" It declined to comment on its dealings with Maxsa.\n\nHome Depot and the National Retail Federation declined to comment. Walmart did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA Park Right, a laser-guided parking aid, made by Maxsa Innovations. (J. Lawler Duggan for The Washington Post)\n\nWest, a gizmo enthusiast named Small Business Executive of the Year by the Consumer Technology Association in 2016, founded Maxsa in 2003. He and his wife, Beth Citrin, run the company from their home in Northern Virginia, where they employ six people.\n\nMany of the company's products are electronic, including a motion-sensing lantern that lights up when a person approaches a home's front door. Others are lower-tech, including the Escaper Buddy, a pair of plastic orange tracks that give drivers traction to dislodge their cars from snow or mud. Says Maxsa's website: \"Never stay stuck again!\"\n\nA natural salesman who has hawked his wares on QVC, West immediately began showing off his products during a visit to the company's warehouse in Lorton, Va., this week. \"If you want to add a light outside your house and you don't have an electrician you want to spend $300 for -- two screws, four C-cell batteries, it's a motion activated light!\" he said, brandishing a lantern. Thousands of boxes from China and Taiwan were stacked in neat rows, waiting to be loaded onto UPS trucks and sent off to retailers.\n\nMaxsa sells to a variety of distributors and auto-related websites, but over the years Amazon has become its most important customer. So in November, several months after the tariffs took effect, Maxsa asked Amazon for a price increase of roughly 20 percent.\n\nSome companies use Amazon's platform to sell their wares directly to consumers. Maxsa has a more traditional arrangement, with Amazon buying goods from it and reselling them.\n\nAmazon sells about 100 Maxsa products, about half of which Maxsa makes in China. But the gadgetmaker limited its price-increase request to several versions of Park Right, which fell under a tariff category of goods used for \"electrical signaling, safety or traffic control.\"\n\nThe gizmo is one of Maxsa's top sellers, with Amazon ordering hundreds a week. \"I'm amazed how many people have trouble parking,\" West told The Post.\n\nMaxsa initially submitted its request online, through an Amazon portal, and waited for a response. When it did not hear back immediately, Maxsa decided to stop selling Park Right devices to Amazon, rejecting the retailer's weekly emailed requests to order the product at the old prices.\n\nWest said he is not sure Amazon really noticed. \"We literally stopped selling to them to show them how serious we were, and it didn't seem to matter that much,\" he said. \"We're a little drop in the bucket to them.\"\n\n[Trump doubles tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports]\n\nEventually, Amazon rejected the price-increase request, West said. So Maxsa asked an outside marketing firm to contact Amazon in mid-January with a more modest request -- an increase of 13 to 14 percent. When Amazon did not reply, the marketing firm followed up six days later. \"My vendor is really in a tough spot with these items,\" the firm wrote on Jan. 24. \"Can you, please, help us push the tariff price increases through, today/tomorrow?\"\n\nFour days later, an Amazon manager replied with bad news. He could not approve such a large increase, he said, especially considering that Amazon's cost to purchase the device was considerably higher than Maxsa's cost to import it.\n\nThe manager said Amazon could pay 3 percent more.\n\nWest decided to take over the email exchange, replying the same day. \"Please allow these increases of 13-14% to go through so we can start selling [to] Amazon again,\" he wrote.\n\nAmazon stuck to its 3 percent offer, calling it a fair share of the burden. The Amazon manager also mistakenly referred to Park Right as falling under a 10 percent tariff -- prompting West to immediately set him straight.\n\nThe tariff was 25 percent, not 10, he wrote. He also offered a reassurance: \"Of course if the tariffs go away we will lower our prices,\" West said.\n\nAmazon thanked him for the clarification and said its internal policies dictated that price increases for products facing a 25 percent tariff should not exceed 5 percent.\n\nAfter a few more exchanges West managed to nudge that up to 5.5 percent, but Amazon said it would go no further.\n\nWest accepted the offer and started shipping the Park Right again.\n\nAs a UPS truck departed from Maxsa's warehouse with a load of boxes for Amazon this week, West said Amazon's pricing affects what other big retailers pay. Maxsa is negotiating a deal with another large retailer, he said, \"and they have to be clear they can sell for less than Amazon.\"\n\nAmazon is \"the benchmark,\" he said, \"and everyone sets against it.\"\n\nA warehouse in Lorton, Va., used by Maxsa Innovations.

Here's the sign-up.]\n\nI asked Natalie, a business reporter at The Times, about her path to hosting in a Slack conversation.\n\nNatalie Kitroeff: O.K.! I started here at The Times as an assistant, left and worked at Bloomberg and then The L.A. Times, and then came back here to cover the industrial economy. Here I am. Can I ask you questions or no?\n\nMichael Barbaro: Not really. Who were you an assistant to?\n\nNatalie: I was an assistant to Nick Kristof and Charles Blow.\n\nMichael: Oh, wow. I had no idea. So you spent time in our Opinion department with the columnists.\n\nNatalie: I did. I was mainly a fact-checker.\n\nMichael: What's your favorite story of checking facts for Nick and Charles?\n\nNatalie: Honestly, the most hilarious moments did not involve fact-checking. They involved being Nick Kristof's travel planner. I had to file expenses for him.\n\nMichael: That man travels. And travels.\n\nNatalie: He would go places and bring back, like, a receipt on a piece of bark. It was hard to file. Then I would need to interface with all these governments that he had recently insulted in a column, to try to get him a visa.\n\nMichael: As in, hi, it's Natalie. I know you are really mad at Nick, but he'd like your permission to enter your country.\n\nNatalie: Exactly. He just called out your dictatorship, but, um, he's on his way!\n\nMichael: So you learn the art of persuasion.\n\nNatalie: Yes. And diplomacy. Also truly learned that if you are straightforward and honest with people, they will respect you.\n\nMichael: Wise words.\n\nNatalie: Even if they don't necessarily adore hearing from you.\n\nMichael: So that naturally leads you to want to report yourself?\n\nNatalie: Yeah, exactly. I caught the bug. Fact-checking is grueling work, but it is also the core of what we do. I liked the precision of it.\n\nMichael: I very much remember your first \"Daily\" episode, a really eye-opening investigation into pregnancy discrimination, because we all decided immediately that we wanted you back on ASAP, which is what happened.\n\nNatalie: Oh, that's nice.\n\nMichael: And now, from guest ... to guest host. How are you feeling about that?\n\nNatalie: Oof. It's not as easy as impersonating Michael in my living room?\n\nMichael: Hah.\n\nNatalie: No, but seriously, it isn't easy. One of the things about newspaper reporting that I always try to remember is that there is this imbalance built into it -- the things I say don't generally end up in an article, whereas the things people say to me do. But then, on \"The Daily,\" you, as the reporter, are right there in it. Every gasp, every giggle, every ... hmmmm.\n\nMichael: Hmmm. Do you think there are advantages to that? Having a reporter (you) be so present in the conversation?\n\nNatalie: The really nice thing is that there are these moments in reporting that never, ever make it into the newspaper -- moments of levity in a tough call, little tangents that would never make it into the lead of a news story, but are just so deeply a part of what we do. It's nice to feel like we can show people that we are humans, just talking to other humans, trying to figure things out.\n\nMichael: Entirely. There's also just the transparency of hearing both sides of a conversation. Not just one side.\n\nNatalie: Yes! I think that is really important, especially now. With the whole fake news meme.\n\nMichael: What's been the most fun about it?\n\nNatalie: The most fun -- being in the studio with the producers or with you, hearing something incredible in the middle of an interview, and looking up at the producers and making eye contact and just being like, YES! That's amazing!\n\nMichael: Give me an example.\n\nNatalie: Oh, well, when we were talking with Eldon, there was a moment in the middle of the interview where he brought up something that we hadn't really thought about in planning the interview. He pipes up with this smart, thoughtful description of what he's worried about. It was more than just the immediate questions of survival -- will the trade war kill his farm? -- but something much bigger and more diffuse. Will the trade war cause long-term damage to the trading relationships that the U.S. agriculture industry has built up over decades? I looked up at Paige, one of the producers, in that moment, and just shook my head, truly in wonder. Like, wow, this man needs a podcast!\n\nMichael: The Eldon Show. He's one of those guests we end up talking about for years. Like, remember Eldon? Why don't we just call back Eldon and make that an episode?\n\nNatalie: I get that.\n\nMichael: O.K., so, I have to run into a script planning session. But I want to leave with a final question and a thought. You possess this rare combination of intelligence, kindness, authority and wittiness. We like you. Will you agree to host more episodes?\n\nNatalie: Hmmm. Just kidding. Obviously, yes. Please. Whenever. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nMichael: Wonderful! We'll be in touch.\n\nNatalie: I'm just nervous the world will resist a Barbaro-free episode. Anyway, we can talk about that neurosis later. Byeee!!!\n\nMichael: They crave something new.\n\nTalk to Natalie on Twitter: @nataliekitro. And Michael: @mikiebarb.\n\nAbout that ending\n\nMany of you wondered why we ended Tuesday's episode about Representative Rashida Tlaib with a quote from President Trump that condemned her statements about the Holocaust and claimed she dislikes Jewish people. Why did we give him the last word? Several factors went into that decision:\n\n1. The president's quote appeared in what we call the \"back announce,\" the final words Michael reads in a segment that update you on what's happened since we recorded an interview. Back announces are, by design, almost always chronological. Events are laid out in the order they happened. In this case, the president's tweet was sent a day after Tlaib decried her critics for \"twisting and turning my words.\" It was the last development.\n\n2. We believed that Tlaib's claim that her words were being taken out of context, juxtaposed with a scolding presidential tweet that offered no context whatsoever, was revealing.\n\n3. Donald Trump is the president. His words and opinions matter. In an episode in which we devoted 30 minutes to having Tlaib tell her story and frame her views, we felt comfortable including the words of one of her most vocal critics: the president of the United States.\n\nWhat we're listening to\n\nWho: Marc Georges, an editor for \"The Daily\"\n\nWhat: \"Nerdette Recaps Game of Thrones with Peter Sagal\"\n\nThe cultural colossus that is \"Game of Thrones\" will come to an end this weekend.

Don't Tell Me!\" Hosts Greta Johnsen and Tricia Bobeda, along with Peter, have great chemistry on the mic, and the best thing about their podcast is that it doesn't turn into a love fest for G.o.T.

(J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post) By Abha Bhattarai Abha Bhattarai Reporter covering the retail industry May 17 at 12:25 PM\n\nThere is only one way to save his business, says Charlie George: by raising the price of dog sweaters.\n\nHis company, PetRageous Designs, in Wilmington, Mass., has until now absorbed hundreds of thousands of dollars in tariffs on pet toys, clothing and accessories. But the latest round of tariffs, which went into effect last Friday, imposes a 25 percent tax on virtually everything he sells, making it impossible to stay profitable unless he passes on those costs to consumers.\n\n\"This is penalizing people who have no alternative -- and ultimately, it will punish the customer,\" said George, who co-founded the family business 15 years ago. \"The president says he's trying to punish the enemy, but we're not the enemy. We make rain coats for dogs.\"\n\nPresident Trump's trade war with China is striking Americans where it hurts: their wallets. Across the country, manufacturers and retailers say they are preparing to raise prices by about 20 percent to offset the newest tax on Chinese-made goods. Many say this month's escalation of the trade war caught them by surprise -- they had just begun to make adjustments to cover the 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods that went into effect in September -- when Trump tweeted that the tax would rise to 25 percent. Now the Trump administration is mulling another 25 percent tariff on all remaining Chinese imports, which would affect just about everything Americans buy, from clothing and food to toys and furniture.\n\nJoseph Cohen, chief executive of Snow Joe, last week marked up prices for the first time in the company's 15-year history. Garden tillers, which were previously $99, now sell for $139. The price of electric wood chippers has also gone up.\n\n\"These are low-cost products that can't be sourced anywhere else,\" Cohen said. \"If we were to make them in the United States, we'd be paying four times as much.\"\n\n[Five ways the trade war will hurt American shoppers]\n\nOther manufacturers are also passing on costs to consumers. Leather blazers that sold for $129 two weeks ago now cost $149. Electric bicycles have jumped in price from $2,000 to $2,200. And $470 nylon suitcases now retail for $529.\n\n\"Prices are going up and people are starting to notice,\" said Nicole Panettieri, owner of the Brass Owl, a boutique that sells handbags and accessories in New York's Queens borough. \"But as a small-business owner, there's nothing I can do about it.\"\n\n\"We're not happy about it, but we're going to have to raise prices,\" said Pennye Jones-Napier, co-owner of Big Bad Woof, a pet store in Washington's Takoma Park neighborhood. Several vendors, including PetRageous Designs, have informed her that they'll be hiking prices to keep up with new tariffs.\n\n\"As a small, local company, we're already struggling,\" she said. \"There's nothing else we can do.\"\n\n\"We're going to have to raise prices,\" said Pennye Jones-Napier, co-owner of Big Bad Woof, a pet store in Washington's Takoma Park neighborhood. (J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post)\n\nIf George had his way, all of his products would be manufactured in the United States. (\"When I was growing up, 'imports' was a dirty word,\" he says.) But puffy vests and quilted jackets for dogs require a number of handmade components that make it almost impossible to find qualified U.S. workers to do the same type of work at similar prices. Instead, George relies on a network of factories in China and India to make pet clothing, ceramic dog bowls, steel cookie jars and other accessories.\n\nLast week he informed customers that he will soon be raising prices. He's not sure how much the markup will be -- or how much more retailers will have to charge customers to make a profit -- but he says he expects shoppers will soon be paying about 20 percent more for his products.\n\n\"The way the tariffs were imposed, we have no way to seek relief,\" said George, a registered Republican who voted for Trump. \"I was very annoyed, being a Republican, that our president would suggest that the Chinese are paying for the tariffs. No. It's Americans who are paying.\"\n\n['Are these tariffs going to happen?' U.S. retailers fearful as they try to plan for holidays.]\n\nThe past decade has been good to George. Americans are spending more than ever on their pets, allowing him to build a successful business with 14 employees and millions in annual sales. The company sells to major retailers like Kohl's and Walmart, and also licenses dog vests, jackets and sweaters for brands like Eddie Bauer. George declined to provide sales figures but said it has had \"double-digit growth\" in recent years.\n\nAll of that, he says, could be in jeopardy. Dog T-shirts and cat place mats are often impulse purchases, and among the first things families pull back on as they begin paying more for essentials like toilet paper and groceries. (The 194-page list of items affected by the tariffs includes all sorts of things: cauliflower, clementines, deodorant, ponchos, petroleum jelly.)\n\nIn all, the newest tariffs are expected to cost each American family an average of $767 a year, according to a report by the Trade Partnership, a Washington-based research and consulting firm.\n\n\"Let's face it, dog toys are not a necessity,\" George said. \"People see something for $5, they think of their dog at home -- he's happy, he's wagging his tail -- and they buy it. What happens when that toy is now $7? Maybe they don't want it anymore.\"\n\nDog food sold by Annamaet, a U.S. company that imports from China, sits on the shelves at The Big Bad Woof in Washington. (J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post)\n\nA year ago, PetRageous Designs used to pay a 2.8 percent tariff on pet clothing. Today, it pays nearly 10 times that, at 27.8 percent. For a company that operates on ever-thinner margins, that sort of cost increase is enough to wipe out any profits, George said.\n\nWhat bothers him the most, though, is not knowing what comes next.\n\nHe's been collecting holiday orders for weeks and now expects that retailers will revise down some of those purchases. A number of factors -- like exactly when a certain shipment makes it to shore -- can end up costing him thousands.\n\n\"We have orders on a ship right now, minding their own business,\" George said. \"As soon as they clear customs, they're going to be whacked with a 25 percent tariff. We don't even have time to react.\"\n\nFor now, he keeps a close watch on the news and has been following the president's Twitter account, where Trump maintains that the tariffs are \"very bad for China, very good for USA!\"\n\n\"I would just like to know what the ultimate goal is,\" George said. \"Businesses like ours, we hate uncertainty, and this guy is like a slinky. To the president, this is just another skirmish. For us, it's a real-life test.\"\n\nBusiness owners say they were just beginning to breathe a sigh of relief when the president's May 5 tweets sent them into a tailspin. By May 10, they were dealing with a surprise round of new tariffs.\n\n\"There's a reason trade policy is historically developed over many months or many years, versus the course of minutes,\" said Peter J.

(Scott Olson/Getty Images) By Laura Reiley Laura Reiley Reporter covering the business of food May 17 at 7:00 AM\n\nChinese buyers canceled a major order for American pork, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Thursday, heightening fears that the U.S.-China trade dispute was set to inflict even more pain on American farmers who have taken a series of hits in Trump's trade wars.\n\nAs of April 18 there were export commitments of American pork to China of 150,000 metric tons, only 50,000 of which had been shipped, leaving others in the balance.\n\nThe uncertainty is unsettling farmers like Randy Spronk who raises 250,000 pigs a year at his farm in Pipestone County, Minn., and sells to giant food processing companies like JBS, Tyson and Hormel.\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement in 2017 cost American farmers market share in Japan. Spronk says 20 percent tariffs in Mexico have cost hog farmers an additional $12 per animal and that an earlier round of Chinese retaliatory tariffs cost $8 per animal.\n\n\"American pork is a $6.4 billion export market, but we've been hit more than any other sector,\" Spronk says. \"Our highest value markets are the ones that are impacted by these tariffs. We got side swiped. The additive effects of these tariffs come out of my back pocket.\"\n\nHog farmers saw a small financial uptick in March, attributed to the prospect of selling into China after that country's pig industry was decimated by African swine fever.\n\nThat seems unlikely to happen now. The latest escalation of tariffs means that American pork will not be economically competitive in China.\n\nStill, Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, thinks pork is an important negotiating tool with China.\n\n\"If the administration is serious about seeking a deal, that is clearly the path of least resistance,\" he said. \"Because of African swine fever and their own domestic situation, China doesn't really have a choice and they will have to fulfill their needs by global supply.\"\n\nWith the imminent release of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's new trade relief program for farmers and ranchers, a battle has begun among agricultural sectors about who should get what, how much and in what form, and exactly who has suffered the worst losses due to trade disputes.\n\n[US farmers who sell to China feel pain of Beijing's tariffs]\n\nPresident Trump has promised at least $15 billion, a number he says corresponds to Chinese purchases of American agricultural products. This is on top of $12 billion distributed as relief to farmers last year to offset losses associated with Chinese retaliatory duties.\n\nWith that $12 billion, there were winners (soy) and losers (corn and wheat), specialty crops that were singled out for assistance (cherries and almonds) and other parts of the American food system that received no aid at all despite discernible losses due to tariffs (the seafood industry).\n\nSpronk's hogs have been part of the export market for years. Japan has historically been No. 1 by price and volume, buying high-value loins; Mexico is No. 2 by price, buying mostly hams. China has been the No. 3 export country, using up organs, feet and other lower-value cuts; Korea is in fourth place, prizing shoulder cuts, and Canada represents the fifth market by volume.\n\nWhat Spronk wants to see is the removal of tariffs from Mexican and Canadian steel and aluminum (and thus retaliatory tariffs from Mexico), free trade agreements with Japan and China, and the ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\n\"I don't want the check from the government, I want to take pride in what I do. I want to compete,\" he said.\n\n[Perdue says farmer aid package still a work in progress]\n\nEven within his own industry, there is dissent on what relief should look like.\n\nNick Giordano, vice president and counsel for the National Pork Producers Council, says the pork industry will ask the USDA to purchase pork for food aid. He says food banks and noncommercial channels represent a win for consumers and those in need without driving down pork prices with a glut on the market.\n\nSenator Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and others have indicated that purchasing farmers' excess for international food relief would be subject to World Trade Organization violations.\n\n\"Unless the food is used for humanitarian reasons we'd be subject to WTO violation,\" Grassley told The Washington Post early this week. \"If (President Trump) buys up $15 billion and he can't ship it overseas because he doesn't want to violate the WTO .\u2009.\u2009. then it's a depressant on the market because people know that the government holds so much grain.\"\n\n\"Trump has opened the door to helping needy people outside the U.S.,\" Giordano says, \"And that's the door we want to walk through. Most of our producers are going to say, 'So what if there's a WTO issue? We've got a five-alarm fire on our hands.' I defy anybody to look my producers in the eye and tell them the government shouldn't work with them on pork as food aid.\"\n\nAlthough pork is just one of many sectors of American agriculture that have been injured by the trade wars, it is likely the hardest hit of the animal agriculture categories. The U.S. accounts for a relatively small share of beef and poultry sold into China because of other non-tariff barriers.\n\nBut there's one American protein that has been welcomed with open arms in recent years in China: Maine lobster.\n\n[The first round of China tariffs already stifled U.S. exports]\n\nIn the early 1990s there were 30 to 40 million pounds caught annually; by 2011 that number had grown to 100 million pounds. Producers like Tom Adams of Maine Coast, a lobster wholesaler, had to find new customers who weren't going to drive down the domestic price.\n\n\"We started shipping to China in 2013 and it was our fastest growth area. Asia accounted for 40 percent of our sales in 2016 and 2017, and China accounted for half of that, $10 million a year in revenue from China.\"\n\nHe had three weeks' notice about the last round of retaliatory Chinese tariffs, which went into effect July 6, 2018. He had to make a fast pivot to find additional domestic sales, and he says the Canadian lobster industry has swooped in to sell to China.\n\n\"We were already at a trade disadvantage in the E.U. with Canada. In 2018 we had 35 percent of our market affected negatively by a trade agreement or trade war.\"\n\nOf the upcoming trade relief program, Adams isn't hopeful.\n\n\"Grains play a much bigger role in our economy, but it bothers us as seafood industry members that we've never really been represented. We fall under agriculture but not in these relief programs. Our net income has been affected much like soy. These tariffs have affected by employees, my family and my industry.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VZLgNHYb2MUB1M99IbWlGqSSx9A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V3STI6TXL4I6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4789558", "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 295793400}, {"uri": "1138387710", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-17", "time": "10:16:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-17T10:16:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/opinion/trade-war-tech-china-united-states.html", "title": "Opinion | Did China Break the World Economic Order?", "body": "Last Friday, the White House raised the tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports up to 25 percent. On Monday, China retaliated with tariffs of its own. The trade war is now full-on -- except that it's not really about trade.\n\nChina does account for the largest share of America's trade deficit. But many experts don't seem to think that bilateral trade deficits are a problem in themselves -- they're just a symptom of other issues (if even that). \"The overall United States global trade imbalance is the result of economic conditions in the United States -- the excess of investment over savings,\" Martin Feldstein, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has argued, adding that if America's trade imbalance with China were eliminated, it would simply shift to other countries.\n\nWhether President Trump is misguided in doggedly pursuing tariffs or playing coy and using them as leverage with the Chinese government, America's continued drive to levy penalties is less about fixing a trade problem than about changing China's investment rules. In particular, the Trump administration perceives those rules as forcing the transfer of foreign technology to Chinese companies, unfairly helping them.\n\nBut even American negotiators who parse the trade versus tech issue this clearly tend to overlook an essential fact: The international trade and financial system that was set up after World War II -- with the creation of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and, much later, the World Trade Organization (all nurtured and dominated by the United States) -- actively encouraged \"technological spillovers\" from developed economies to developing ones. Under the W.T.O.'s agreements on intellectual property, developed countries are under \"the obligation\" to provide incentives to their companies to transfer technology to less developed countries.\n\nSuch transfers were seen to be in the West's interest, too: Far better that poor countries achieve self-sustaining growth than be dependent on foreign aid, the thinking went. But China did much better than achieve self-sustaining growth.\n\nBy the late 2000s, it had come to seem too successful, and a threat: The West was struggling then with a major financial crisis (largely of its own doing). Today, the longstanding principle that knowledge transfers are good all-around is being questioned. Do they continue to serve the global interest and should they still be encouraged -- even when it comes to China? Or should China be treated as an exception? It is in a class of its own, by dint of both its size and the state's involvement in its economy.\n\nAmerican negotiators have long complained that China's foreign investment practices are unfair. A report of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, published in 2013 and often cited since, estimated that China accounted for 50 to 80 percent of all international intellectual property theft. In its 2018 report, the Office of the United States Trade Representative accused China of using joint ventures to funnel technology to Chinese companies and of failing to protect foreign companies' intellectual property rights.\n\nBut the reality is more complex.\n\nYes, American companies have been granted access to some 35 restricted sectors in China -- like auto production, oil exploration, nuclear power, telecommunications, banks and medical institutions -- only on the condition that they transfer know-how to local partners. Chinese companies are developing electric vehicles with support from Renault-Nissan and Ford. Amazon and Microsoft are being asked to partner -- and share technology -- with Chinese companies before they can sell cloud-computing services in China.\n\nAnd yes, DuPont and General Motors have sued their Chinese joint-venture partners for misappropriating trade secrets. Outright theft also has sometimes occurred, including in the defense sector, of information about bombers and missile systems.\n\nBut to say all these things in the same breath is to risk conflating inadequate rules with violations of existing rules that may be adequate, and government policy with the behavior of private actors. Officials in the Trump administration suggest that China's foreign-investment requirements themselves amount to theft. In many instances, however, technology is being transferred between companies in the context of consensual, negotiated business agreements.\n\nAlso, violations or near-violations are par for the course during certain stages of a country's development. That fact doesn't make them acceptable, but it offers useful context for thinking through how best to react to them. Other rapidly growing economies, including Japan and South Korea in the 1980s, were also accused of unfairly securing technology from foreign partners (or subsidizing their exports). But as those countries' incomes rose and their own capacity to innovate developed, they started complying with the rules -- typically when per capita income reached $25,000.\n\nChina, at its current growth rates, is more than a decade away from achieving that income level. And yet it has already made more progress than is usually acknowledged toward protecting intellectual property rights. AmCham China's 2019 China Business Climate Survey Report noted that 59 percent of the more than 300 American companies it interviewed said that China's enforcement of intellectual property rights had improved over the last five years; 37 percent said it had stayed the same. (China is growing up in other respects, too. Both the I.M.F. and the United States Treasury have recently determined that the Chinese government is not manipulating its currency. And its current account surpluses have virtually evaporated.)\n\nThat said, penalties for, say, infringing patents remain weak in China and enforcement is lax. The National People's Congress passed a foreign-investment law in March, but it offered too little on implementation. In fact, the United States's latest tariffs were prompted by its perception that the Chinese government was backtracking on its commitment to incorporate into Chinese law major terms of the two countries' draft agreement to end the trade war.\n\nThe fundamental question, therefore, is this: Are China's current technology-transfer policies fair, given both past international practice and the country's extraordinary development? Or, to put the point more provocatively, did China's growth break the international economic order?\n\nRelatedMore from Opinion on China's economy.Opinion | Yi-Zheng LianXi Jinping Wanted Global Dominance.

It Doesn't Have to Be.March 13, 2018\n\nThe answer partly depends on the existence, or not, of globally accepted guidelines. Just last year, in its World Economic Outlook report, the I.M.F. again highlighted the vital role that the diffusion of technology worldwide has played in driving growth globally. And China now accounts for almost one-third of global growth every year, according to Bloomberg.\n\nA more innovative China also doesn't mean a less competitive America. For one thing, as the Harvard economist Robert Lawrence has pointed out, developed countries and developing ones generally do not compete in the same product lines. The economist Zhang Jun and others have also argued that much of China's technological capacities are overstated anyway. Many of the more sophisticated components used in products that China exports to the West (think iPhones) are made elsewhere and merely assembled in China.\n\nCurbs on America's exports of \"emerging and foundational technologies\" -- notably to do with artificial intelligence or fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications networks -- will curtail knowledge flows to China. But they will also damage America's capacity for innovation, American tech experts have argued. (Likewise, Mr. Trump's decision this week to ban, on security grounds, foreign tech equipment in American telecommunications systems could hurt American companies.)\n\nTechnology transfers from the most developed states to less developed ones remain beneficial all-around, including for the most developed states -- even if the unique features of China's remarkable growth require adapting existing norms and regulatory mechanisms to better manage those transfers.\n\nThe Trump administration, which instinctively recoils at multilateral initiatives, is unlikely to want to turn to the W.T.O. or the World Bank. (It should, though, not least because the United States has usually fared well by W.T.O. rulings.) The next best opportunity to at least broach these issues will be during the Group of 20 summit meeting in Osaka, Japan, in June. China's growth may seem like a challenge to the world's economic order, but it is other states' reactions to it that could threaten the system.\n\nYukon Huang is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author of \"Cracking the China Conundrum: Why Conventional Economic Wisdom Is Wrong.\"\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

In Washington, on Wall Street and in corporate boardrooms, Beijing has used the country's size and promise for decades to quell opposition and reward those who helped its rise.\n\nThose days may be coming to an end.\n\nAs it struggles with President Trump's trade war, a maturing and debt-laden China is discovering that it no longer has the same pull. Members of both political parties in the United States favor a tougher stance against Beijing. Some old business allies are standing on the sidelines or even cheering the Trump administration's strong stands.\n\nChina could still prevail on the trade war's major issues. But the conflict's length and severity reflect the growing perception that the country no longer holds the promise that once enthralled politicians and businesses in the United States.\n\nMany American companies with large, profitable businesses in China do not want to pay expensive tariffs and worry that the United States is antagonizing the Chinese public, said Ker Gibbs, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. But many of the same businesses also chafe at the numerous restrictions that China has long maintained on foreign companies.\n\n\"We're looking at their expanding into global markets, and saying, 'Wait a minute, why can't we do that here?'\" Mr. Gibbs said.\n\nChina's economic slowdown, which could hinder growth globally, is a major reason its influence has ebbed. But there are other factors. The country's heavy debts, built up over years of lending used to spur growth, limit its options. If it retaliates against the United States sharply by devaluing its currency or shutting factories crucial to global supply chains, the moves could ricochet and hurt its own newfound wealth.\n\nForeign businesses have found it less appealing to make or sell their products in China over the last several years because of heavy restrictions on foreign businesses, stronger local competitors and rising costs. Mr. Trump's tariffs last year gave many businesses a final reason to look elsewhere.\n\nCall it the ABC supply chain, as in \"anywhere but China.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Kelly A. Kramer, the chief financial officer of Cisco, the big telecom equipment supplier, told investors that the company had \"greatly, greatly reduced\" its exposure to China because of the tariffs.\n\nMorey, a company near Chicago that makes rugged electronics for bulldozers and other outdoor equipment, reluctantly paid more for printed circuit boards made in China after Mr. Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion a year in Chinese imports last fall.\n\nWith those tariffs now rising to 25 percent, Morey executives have begun talking to suppliers in Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore.\n\n\"I was thinking this is a short-term issue that will go away,\" said George Whittier, the company's president and chief operating officer, \"and I don't think you can rationally think that any more.\"\n\nChina holds a lot of cards. It remains a huge profit source for Apple, Boeing, General Motors, Starbucks and other major corporations. It can use its substantial financial firepower and the government's control over crucial economic levers to endure a protracted trade conflict, while state-run media outlets help stem discontent at home.\n\nChinese officials and experts say the country can stand firm against Western pressure. Even some advocates of more market-oriented policies say Beijing should just make its own decisions now instead of tying them to a trade pact with Washington.\n\n\"China should focus on its own reform, which will eventually solve some current trade war contentious issues,\" said Zhu Ning, a Tsinghua University economist.\n\nStill, China has lost some of the swagger and appeal that once opened so many doors in Washington and on Wall Street.\n\nChina has long used its tremendous size and growth potential as both carrot and stick. Companies that played by its rules could gain access to a market of more than one billion people who were becoming increasingly affluent and eager to spend. Companies that complained could be left out.\n\nIt worked. G.M. and other companies caved in to demands like being forced to take on local joint venture partners, knowing that they were training future competitors. General Electric sold one complete diesel locomotive from Erie, Pa., to China, then taught the Chinese to build their own. Apple censors its App Store in China. When Google protested censorship and hacking, it was mostly kicked out.\n\nBusinesses then helped make China's case in Washington. When China wanted to join the World Trade Organization, the global trade club, it enlisted Wall Street's help. Businesses helped persuade successive American presidents to refrain from punishing China for manipulating its currency, even as Beijing manipulated its currency. They fought efforts to raise tariffs.\n\nChina remains vital to many businesses, but the dynamic has shifted. It still grows at a pace that developed countries envy. But its economy has slowed significantly from rates that as recently as 2010 topped 10 percent a year. Since Xi Jinping took power in 2012, the government has taken a stronger hand in business, requiring foreign companies to forge ties with the Communist Party and demanding access to data.\n\nBeijing has fewer ways to strike back against the United States now. Its tremendous success in nurturing its own homegrown industries, which has helped China's economy rise up the value chain, has reduced its imports of American goods, giving it fewer items to hit with tariffs.\n\nA decade ago, China bought Jeeps made in Michigan by Chrysler, bulldozers and other construction equipment made in Illinois by Caterpillar and huge diesel engines made in Indiana by Cummins. Now Chrysler makes Jeeps in Changsha and Guangzhou. Caterpillar makes construction equipment in Xuzhou. And Cummins builds engines at factories in Beijing, Chongqing, Hefei, Liuzhou, Xi'an and Xiangyang.\n\n\"China has been so effective at squeezing manufactured imports out of its market that it has really limited its options to retaliate,\" said Brad Setser, a Treasury official in the Obama administration who is now an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nChina's imports from the United States now fall mostly into four big categories: Boeing aircraft from Washington State; semiconductors, mainly from Intel factories in Oregon; farm products and energy from the Great Plains and Texas; and German-brand sport utility vehicles from South Carolina and Alabama. Although China could still shake the American political system if any harsh retaliation hurt economic growth in the United States, it has fewer opportunities to target electoral swing states and hurt Mr. Trump's chances of re-election next year.\n\nSlapping tariffs on those industries could also have big drawbacks. China needs those chips for its technology upgrades. Targeting Boeing planes would shift more Chinese business to Airbus, giving the European aircraft maker more leverage in negotiations with Beijing. On agriculture, China still does not grow enough soybeans to meet its needs, so higher tariffs on American crops might simply mean higher food prices down the line.\n\nChina has also shown surprising vulnerabilities, like its dependence on American semiconductor technology and software. Last year, when the United States briefly prohibited American companies from selling technology to the Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE for violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea, ZTE ground to a halt.\n\n\"The trade friction has also been a cold shower that has made us see our structural shortcomings more clearly,\" said a front-page commentary in People's Daily on Monday that bore a pen name used to signal authoritative positions on international relations.\n\nChina has options besides tariffs, but they have disadvantages as well.\n\nIt could sell a large chunk of the $1.3 trillion in United States Treasury debt that it holds. That could temporarily push up American interest rates. But it would saddle China with large losses. Beijing would have to find someplace else to park the money. Its previous sales, undertaken mainly to shore up the country's currency in 2015 and early 2016, did not affect the bond market much.\n\nAnother option would be for China to let its currency slide in value against the dollar, making its goods cheaper abroad and offsetting American tariffs. Doing that could prompt the Trump administration to raise its tariffs even higher. It might also tempt other countries to devalue their currencies, setting off a potentially costly currency war. And a Chinese devaluation could cause Chinese families and households to send their own savings out of the country.\n\nChina could crack down on American-owned factories in China or on those crucial to the supply chains of American companies. But that could lead still more multinational companies to consider leaving the country.\n\nThe dilemma for China is that the longer the trade war lasts, the more companies may decide to invest elsewhere. For now, domestic politics seem more important in China, with the leadership and the general public reacting angrily to what is portrayed in the country as peremptory American demands.\n\n\"We have the confidence and ability to withstand any external risks and impact,\" Geng Shuang, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said on Thursday.\n\nChris Buckley contributed reporting.

What if a teddy bear, but also Donald Trump?\n\nAnd, so:\n\nThis commercial, for the Trumpy Bear -- a product of Dallas-based Exceptional Products, Inc. -- understandably attracted some media attention when it debuted. Well, really, at multiple points in time as various cable-news networks and print publications were forwarded the YouTube video or saw it promoted on Fox News, often spurring the same reaction: Wait. This is real?\n\nAnd, again, it is. Bear plus Trump. Not complicated. Oh, and plus an American flag, secured safely in Trumpy Bear's back.\n\n\"We have been very pleasantly surprised with the product,\" said Elliott Brackett, a vice president at Exceptional Products, when we spoke by phone on Thursday. Part of its success, he said, was that \"people who love Trump buy it and people who hate Trump buy it.\"\n\nHow could he be so sure of that latter group (which he estimated might make up as much as a fifth of Trumpy Bear sales)? Well, he offered an example. A guy called up and wanted to send a Trumpy Bear to his mother-in-law, just to annoy her. He went so far as to insist that his file include a note saying that his information was not to be shared with anyone who asked and so, when an annoyed mother-in-law called, his privacy remained intact. (If she is a reader of The Post, however, this year's family get togethers might be a little awkward.)\n\nA disclaimer at the bottom of the Trumpy Bear Official Website offers a hint at an intriguing aspect of Trumpy Bear, that Trumpiest of bears. \"Domestic Manufacturers and Distributors,\" it reads, \"contact us!\" The implication? Trumpy Bear and his flag are not made in the USA.\n\nAnd, in fact, they aren't. Brackett confirmed that each Trumpy Bear is, in fact, a native of China.\n\nAt the moment, of course, President Trump is engaged in a knock-down, drag-out trade war with China, levying steep tariffs on products imported from China. The mind reels at the possible implications here. Are Trumpy Bear sales hurting because the cost of the bears went up because Trumpy Bear's inspiration slapped tariffs on them in order to spur more domestic manufacturing?\n\n(Exceptional Products, Inc.) (Philip Bump/Exceptional Products)\n\nAs it turns out, the answer is no, for two reasons.\n\nThe first is that stuffed bears are included among several categories of products for which no increased tariff has been applied by the Trump administration. As Trump has ratcheted up the fight, though, he's pledged at times to expand his tariffs to cover every import from China. Were he to do so, the cost of Trumpy Bears to migrate to the U.S. could increase substantially.\n\nBut Brackett doesn't think that's likely.\n\n\"From a historical -- all my experience since the late '80s, it's very, very difficult to raise prices,\" he said. In the past, as costs have gone up, his company has eaten the increased costs. Even though the Trumpy Bear is a novelty item. (\"This product is unlike any other product we've ever sold,\" he said.)\n\n\"I would not bet against the downward pressure of pricing,\" Brackett explained. \"The American consumer is just far too used to it.\" When other products have become more expensive to produce due to increases in component costs, etc., the company has generally kept sales prices the same. Their products hadn't yet been affected by the trade war, Brackett said.\n\nExceptional Products is a small business with only five full-time staff. While they used to employ scores of people who did order fulfillment at warehouses, that work is now contracted out to other companies. For some of their products, they use Ebay or Amazon fulfillment systems. Trumpy Bears come from China to a warehouse in Dallas, where a contract firm then ships them off to buyers across the U.S. and, occasionally, overseas.\n\nIt's hard not to acknowledge the various levels of irony here. A bear created as a tribute to Trump that's made in China and which is distributed by a company that focuses mostly on marketing to the exclusion of hiring lots of employees. Which, when you phrase it like that, sounds like one of the most honest tributes to Donald Trump the businessman that you can imagine.\n\nBrackett noted that his company can't claim credit for the most successful component of the Trumpy Bear's marketing -- that weird ad.\n\n\"This particular product was developed by an individual inventor who is also a television producer,\" he explained. She invented the bear and produced the television spot to promote it.\n\nTruly an American success story.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/U3bPvVPRprZ4_vWezL7W4v8E8co=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2UGWFGJ2LVEIXMSLBVICVBCHKE.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 295737600}, {"uri": "1137889609", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2019-05-16", "time": "20:28:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-16T20:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/05/16/business/16reuters-usa-trade-china.html", "title": "Huawei Ban Clouds U.S.-China Trade Talks, Tech Sector", "body": "WASHINGTON/BEIJING -- A U.S. bid to block China's Huawei Technologies from buying vital American technology threw into question sales from some of the largest tech companies and drew a sharp rebuke on Thursday from Beijing, which warned it could hurt trade talks.\n\nShares of Huawei's U.S. suppliers fell on fears the Chinese firm would be forced to stop buying American chips, software and other components after the Trump administration banned it from buying U.S. technology without special approval.\n\nHuawei, the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker, said that losing access to U.S. suppliers \"will do significant economic harm to the American companies\" and affect \"tens of thousands of American jobs.\"\n\n\"Huawei will seek remedies immediately and find a resolution to this matter,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Bloomberg the order blacklisting Huawei will go into effect on Friday.\n\nThe U.S. crackdown, announced on Wednesday, was the latest shot fired in a U.S.-China trade war that is rattling financial markets and threatening to derail a slowing global economy.\n\nChinese officials said Washington's aggressive posture could affect trade talks, which appeared to have hit an impasse in the past week as the United States hiked tariffs on Chinese goods and Beijing retaliated with higher duties on U.S. products.\n\nCommerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng stressed that the United States should avoid further damaging Sino-U.S. trade relations. \"China will take all the necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese firms,\" Gao told reporters.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry also announced the formal arrest of two Canadian citizens who were detained shortly after Canada arrested Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in December.\n\nMeng faces extradition to the United States on charges that she conspired to defraud global banks about Huawei's relationship with a company operating in Iran.

(J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post) By Kathy Orton Kathy Orton Reporter and editor covering the Washington metropolitan area housing market May 16 at 10:13 AM\n\nA volatile week in the financial markets had little effect on mortgage rates\n\nAccording to the latest data released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate average dipped to 4.07 percent with an average 0.5 point. (Points are fees paid to a lender equal to 1 percent of the loan amount and are in addition to the interest rate.) It was 4.10 percent a week ago and 4.61 percent a year ago. The 30-year fixed rate has gone down for three weeks in a row.\n\nThe 15-year fixed-rate average slid to 3.53 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 3.57 percent a week ago and 4.08 percent a year ago. The five-year adjustable rate average ticked up to 3.66 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 3.63 percent a week ago and 3.82 percent a year ago.\n\nWorries that trade tensions with China and heightened hostility against Iran will threaten the global economy caused turbulence in the financial markets this week. The Dow Jones industrial average took a tumble Monday before recovering the next two days.\n\nMortgage rates are influenced by investor expectations. When investors are spooked, they tend to shift to safer assets such as bonds. The rally in the bond market drove the yield on the 10-year Treasury down to nearly an 18-month low. It fell to 2.37 percent Wednesday, a drop of almost 20 basis points since early this month. (A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.)\n\nSo far, mortgage rates haven't gone down as dramatically.\n\n\"Rates were buoyed, at times, by assertions that the [U.S.-China trade] disagreement could be resolved in the next couple of months,\" said Matthew Speakman, a Zillow economic analyst. \"In general, however, the ongoing tensions have kept risky assets under pressure, causing markets to seek out the safety of Treasurys and pushing mortgage rates down.\"\n\nDespite the decline in the 10-year Treasury yield, many experts aren't expecting mortgage rates to continue falling. Bankrate.com, which puts out a weekly mortgage rate trend index, found that nearly two-thirds of the experts it surveyed say rates will remain relatively stable in the coming week.\n\n\"President Trump's escalation in the trade war with China has intensified, and mortgage rates and Treasury yields are dropping as a result,\" said Michael Becker, branch manager at Sierra Pacific Mortgage in White Marsh, Md. \"Rates are now near the lows for 2019 that we reached in March. Given the drop in rates over the last few weeks, I don't see them dropping further.\"\n\nMeanwhile, mortgage applications slowed. According to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the market composite index -- a measure of total loan application volume -- decreased 0.6 percent from a week earlier. The refinance index slipped 1 percent from the previous week, while the purchase index declined 1 percent.\n\nThe refinance share of mortgage activity accounted for 37.9 percent of all applications.\n\n\"Despite the modest decline, low rates and the healthy economy continue to propel activity higher than the same time last year,\" said Bob Broeksmit, MBA president and CEO. \"Purchase applications were up 7 percent, and refinance activity was nearly 17 percent above a year ago.\"\n\nMore Real Estate:\n\nHome lenders are becoming more friendly to riskier applicants\n\nCash-out refinancings, HELOCs are down.

The CAC 40 in France was 0.4% higher at 5,397. U.S. stocks were also poised to open modestly higher, with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures up 0.3%.\n\nStocks have been volatile all week amid conflicting signals over the U.S.'s trade position. Some comments from the Trump administration have been positive for stocks, while others have shaken markets.\n\nOn Thursday, China protested the Trump administration's decision to issue an executive order apparently aimed at banning equipment sold by telecoms gear maker Huawei from U.S. networks. It also subjected the Chinese company to strict controls on U.S. exports.\n\nHuawei, the biggest global maker of switching equipment for phone and internet companies, has spent a decade fighting accusations it facilitates Chinese spying.\n\nMarkets have swung wildly in recent weeks as trade tensions between the U.S. and China intensified. The Trump administration more than doubled tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports and spelled out plans to target the $300 billion worth that aren't already facing 25% taxes. The escalation covers everything from sneakers to toasters to billiard balls. The Chinese have retaliated by hiking tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. imports.\n\nIt's not been all bleak, though, with some traders, particularly in Europe, focusing on a potential U.S. decision to postpone tariffs on cars.\n\n\"It is remarkable how the stock markets have managed to hold their own rather well considering everything that's happened, from the escalation of U.S.-China trade war to renewed fears over global growth,\" said Fawad Razaqzada, a technical analyst at FOREX.com.\n\n\"When the market is able to absorb so much negativity, it is usually a sign of strength. So I wouldn't bet against the S&P hitting another record high in the coming days, even if we think the markets are overvalued at current levels.\"\n\nMarkets were bolstered Wednesday by reports that the White House plans to delay a decision about imposing tariffs on autos from Europe and elsewhere by up to six months. A decision was due by Saturday.\n\nCNBC, quoting unnamed sources, said that the administration was close to announcing a postponement of the auto tariffs for up to six months. The administration sees the threat of the auto tariffs as a way to gain leverage over trading partners such as the European Union and Japan in ongoing trade talks.\n\nSentiment was also buoyed by reassurances on trade from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin said he and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer were planning to travel to Beijing for more talks. Details of such negotiations have not been announced by the Chinese side.\n\nEarlier, in Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.6% to finish at 21,062.98. South Korea's Kospi dipped 1.2% at 2,067.69. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.7% to 6,327.80.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump's trade team probably would return to Beijing soon to continue negotiations. He said negotiators are also close to reaching a deal with Canada and Mexico that would lift steel and aluminum tariffs the administration imposed a year ago. And the president, several outlets reported, would delay for six months a decision on imposing import duties on foreign cars and parts, avoiding a move the auto industry has said would be crippling.\n\nInvestors took the developments as a sign that trade peace is primed to break out: Stocks rallied for the second day in a row.\n\nBut developments later in the day should dash that nascent optimism -- and provide a warning to anyone inclined to conclude the Trump administration wants to wind down its trade fights any time soon.\n\nTrump on Wednesday evening declared a national emergency, via an executive order, to protect American communications networks from espionage by foreign suppliers, a move directed at Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Then the Commerce Department effectively banned the sale of American tech to the company, my colleagues Ellen Nakashima and Josh Dawsey report.\n\nAnd rather than declare a temporary cease-fire on autos, Trump will give the European Union and Japan six months to agree to limit their imports into the United States, Bloomberg News's Jenny Leonard and Shawn Donnan report. \"According to the order, which people familiar with the matter say Trump is expected to sign this week, the administration has determined that imports of cars into the U.S. present a threat to national security because they have hurt domestic producers and their ability to invest in new technologies,\" they write.\n\nThe lesson for investors, business owners and everyone else with a stake in the outcome of the trade wars is clear enough: Although Trump may be focused for now on dialing up his confrontation with Beijing, he is still intent on forcing a reckoning with Europe and Japan.\n\nClose observers of Trump's handling of his trade agenda say his get-tough approach to erstwhile allies and strategic competitors alike should come as no surprise. \"Trump loves leverage. So he sees the auto tariffs as a leverage point with the E.U. and also with Japan, primarily for agriculture because the E.U. is refusing to include agriculture in the negotiations,\" says Stephen Myrow, managing partner of policy research firm Beacon Policy Advisors. \"The protectionism angle is going to be with us indefinitely as long as he's in office.\"\n\nIn a note this week, Chris Krueger of Cowen Research Group reached the same conclusion about Trump's attitude toward auto tariffs. \"There is a strong belief in the Administration that the only reason USMCA was signed and that the Chinese are negotiating is because tariffs were not only threatened, but imposed,\" he writes. \"The general idea is in order for Japan and EU negotiators to open up agricultural markets to U.S. farmers, auto (and auto parts) tariffs will be required.\"\n\nAnd even before Trump's executive order on autos, industry sources responded tepidly to the news of the tariff postponement. \"Manufactures and suppliers do best when there's certainty in the economic environment. And these continued negotiations, with the cloud of not having agreement on what we're negotiating, just extends the uncertainty,\" said Anne Wilson, a top lobbyist for the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association. \"This will lead to loss of jobs and loss of investment in the U.S.\"\n\nOr as the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers put it in a Wednesday statement, \"The case remains clear -- cars are not a national security threat. We are deeply concerned that the administration continues to consider imposing auto tariffs.\"\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\n-- Hope for USMCA: \"[Trump's] flailing domestic agenda received a spark of life on Wednesday, with top lawmakers in both parties expressing new hope that the president's North American trade pact could be ratified by Congress this year,\" Politico's Heather Caygle, Burgess Everett and Sabrina Rodriguez report. \"Key officials negotiating the deal with Mexico and Canada are working both sides of the Capitol in an effort to ease concerns not only over the provisions of the pact but Trump's ongoing tariff war with Mexico, Canada, Europe and China.\"\n\n-- Xi speaks, brushes back critiques of Chinese culture. Chinese President Xi Jinping repeated his rallying cry about his nation's culture on Wednesday, continuing his call \"on Asian countries to stand together with self-confidence and promote their culture as the world becomes 'multipolar,' my colleague Gerry Shih reports from Beijing. \"Wednesday's conference came weeks after a top State Department official drew heavy criticism from within U.S. policy circles and from China for remarks casting U.S. competition with China as a cultural and racial clash.\"\n\n-- Alibaba reports slower growth. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba \"appears to be feeling the effects of China's economic slowdown and the trade war with the United States,\" the New York Times's Raymond Zhong reports. \"[Alibaba] Group said on Wednesday that revenue increased by 51 percent in the March quarter from the same period last year. That topped Wall Street's expectations, and was a pickup from the quarter before. But it was still the company's second-slowest pace of revenue expansion since early 2016.\"\n\n\"Alibaba's enormous size makes the company a closely watched bellwether for consumer and business sentiment in China, even if it's an obstacle to finding new ways to make money.\"\n\n-- North Carolina sues Juul: \"North Carolina Attorney General Joshua Stein filed a lawsuit Wednesday against popular e-cigarette maker Juul Labs, making it the first state to take legal action against the company,\" my colleague Deanna Paul reports. \"The suit, filed in state court, alleges that Juul caused addiction in consumers by \"deceptively downplaying the potency and danger of the nicotine\" and employed advertising campaigns that targeted people under the legal smoking age.\"\n\n-- The Met turns down Sackler money: \"The Metropolitan Museum of Art said on Wednesday that it would stop accepting gifts from members of the Sackler family linked to OxyContin, severing ties between one of the world's most prestigious museums and one of its most prolific philanthropic dynasties,\" the Times's Elizabeth A. Harris reports.\n\n\"The decision was months in the making, and followed steps by other museums, including the Tate Modern in London and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, to distance themselves from the family behind Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin.\"\n\n-- Former Bush NEC director dishes on China's view of Trump: \"President George W. Bush's National Economic Council director [Larry Lindsey], spoke Tuesday separately to both the elected House GOP leadership and top committee Republicans, and his presentation about China and trade turned a lot of heads, according to multiple people who were in both meetings,\" Politico's Anna Palmer, Jake Sherman, Daniel Lippman, Eli Okun and Garrett Ross report. \"China views [Trump] as a 'total narcissist' -- 'a 10-out-of-10 narcissist,' he said. Lindsey attributed this to the president's upbringing and said his mother didn't pay him adequate attention in childhood.\"\n\n\"[Lindsey] said Trump has no long-term plans or ability to think ahead. He said the president has the long-term decision-making ability of an 'empty chair.' \"\n\nMy colleague Josh Dawsey reports this nugget on the Trump-Lindsey nexus:\n\n-- Warren slams Treasury official over Wells Fargo. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has lashed out at Wells Fargo for more than two years. On Wednesday, she \"turned her ire on one of the San Francisco bank's main regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which provides day-to-day oversight of large national banks,\" my colleague Renae Merle reports. \"Wells Fargo is conducting a nationwide search for a new chief executive -- its third in three years -- and Warren wanted to know whether the OCC would exercise its 'veto' power over the bank's choice.

It singles out economic and industrial espionage as areas of particular concern.\n\n\"The President has made it clear that this Administration will do what it takes to keep America safe and prosperous, and to protect America from foreign adversaries who are actively and increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology infrastructure and services in the United States,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.\n\nThe order authorizes the commerce secretary to block transactions involving communications technologies built by firms controlled by a foreign adversary that puts U.S. security at \"unacceptable\" risk -- or poses a threat of espionage or sabotage to networks that underpin the day-to-day running of vital public services.\n\n[GOP senators raise alarms, criticize Trump as U.S.-China trade war heats up]\n\nWednesday's announcement was expected nearly a year ago, and comes as neither Washington nor Beijing appears willing to back down in their ongoing economic dispute. The National Economic Council, which had blocked the move for months, dropped its objection as trade talks hit an impasse, said one official.\n\nTrump's executive order does not immediately exclude any specific firms or countries, but certainly will not lessen tensions with Beijing. It is consistent with Trump's increasingly aggressive tack against China in which he has used tariffs as economic weapons, a tactic that he believes to be popular with his political base.\n\nThe move also boosts the administration's somewhat uphill effort to persuade allies and partners in Europe to bar Huawei, which officials say is beholden to the Chinese government, from their next-generation 5G wireless networks.\n\n[British government delivers scathing assessment of security risks posed by Huawei to U.K. telecom networks]\n\nThe order is not restricted to any one technology, such as 5G, but instead covers a swath of information communications technologies. That could invite a legal challenge from companies who believe it is overly broad, officials and analysts say.\n\nTrump declared the emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1977 law used by every president since Jimmy Carter to impose sanctions on countries such as Iran or Russia. It gives the president broad authority over economic activity.\n\nTrump's executive order instructs the commerce secretary to develop an enforcement regime and permits the secretary to name companies or technologies that could be barred, according to officials.\n\nShould that happen, said Paul Rosenzweig, a former homeland security official in the George W. Bush administration, the banned firm \"would assuredly sue.\" Rosenzweig, now a senior fellow with the R Street Institute, a policy group that advocates free markets, said that congressional action to bar a specific firm likely would have a better chance at withstanding legal scrutiny.\n\nThe order acknowledges that, although an open investment climate is generally positive, the United States needs to do more to protect the security of its networks. The idea is to have an \"in case of emergency, break glass\" authority, said one U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before it was released.\n\nAnd though the president already may veto proposed acquisitions of American companies by foreign buyers if he believes they endanger national security, the government lacks the authority to intervene in specific transactions deemed to pose such a risk.\n\n\"There are other levers we have, based more on contracting influence and power of the purse, but this would be more of an explicit exclusionary authority,\" said an official familiar with the matter.\n\n[U.S. officials planning for a future in which Huawei has a major share of 5G global networks]\n\nLast year Trump signed a law that barred the federal government and its contractors from doing business with Huawei and several other Chinese firms on national security grounds. And the country's four major telecom carriers have committed to the federal government that they will not use Huawei equipment in their networks.\n\nBut this order, once implemented, would establish a national policy applying to commercial entities outside the U.S. government and permits the commerce secretary to name the countries and organizations subject to the restrictions, as well as the technologies at issue. The order also would permit the secretary to direct the timing and manner of how U.S. firms would cease using such equipment, officials said.\n\nA number of rural carriers use Huawei in their networks as a lower-cost alternative to European firms such as Nokia and Ericsson. The Federal Communications Commission is preparing a rule that likely would restrict federal subsidies to carriers that use Huawei gear and the rural carriers have told the government that replacing Huawei is a cost they cannot afford.\n\nA number of European officials in recent months have expressed consternation that the United States is pressing them to block Huawei from their planned 5G networks while not having officially banned the firm. This order helps counter that objection, officials said.\n\nSecurity officials say the issue is one of national security, not trade. But the two inevitably have become linked as China's quest to dominate advanced technologies in the global market has prompted significant concerns about the potential for espionage or sabotage.\n\nTrump, unlike most previous presidents, has frequently relied on national security arguments in his bid to reshape U.S. trading relationships, demonstrating a willingness to stretch legal authorities beyond their customary bounds.\n\nLast year, for instance, he cited a little-used national security provision of a 1962 law to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. He also has ordered the Commerce Department to investigate doing the same on foreign-made automobiles and auto parts.\n\nThe national emergency declaration comes a day after a congressional hearing in which senators from both parties joined administration officials in calling out the risks of doing business with a company like Huawei. They emphasized that the problem was less about the company than the authoritarian country whose system of laws, which lacks due process and transparency, it must obey.\n\n\"It's not about overseeing Huawei. It's about overseeing China,\" said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the hearing on 5G security.\n\n\"This is a single-party government,\" said Christopher Krebs, director of the Homeland Security Department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. \"Everything that flows from the central party is a manifestation of their philosophy.'", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/K_Ki0q1u3CCu0K-IPot4-nkE3hs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5IUH2NTWSYI6TPJFZGEVKXTXMY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4786358", "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 295650360}, {"uri": "1136990700", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-15", "time": "20:52:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-15T20:52:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/15/trumps-multi-front-trade-war-wont-last/", "title": "Opinion | Trump's multi-front trade war won't last", "body": "A worker walks past shipping containers at the Yangshan Deepwater Port in Shanghai on May 10. (Qilai Shen/Bloomberg) By Henry Olsen Henry Olsen Columnist focusing on politics, populism, and American conservative thought Columnist May 15 at 4:25 PM\n\nChina's decision to hike its tariffs on U.S. imports has raised the stakes in President Trump's incipient trade war. To win, he's going to need help from a group he's already on rocky terms with: our allies.\n\nThe United States might be China's most important market, but it is far from its only one. The European Union is the second-biggest importer of Chinese goods after the United States, and China is its second-largest market for exports. Europe also ran a roughly $207 billion trade deficit with China in goods in 2018. U.S. markets and technology are important to China, but the E.U. could easily provide an alternative source of minds, money and markets for China if it does not support Trump's actions.\n\nOther U.S. allies face challenges. Australia, for example, is a huge net exporter of raw materials to China. Australia has not suffered a recession since 1991, and Chinese appetite for the gold and other minerals that lie beneath Australia's surface is a big reason why. Most economists expect that U.S. tariffs will cut China's economic growth, which in turn will reduce its demand for Australian imports. Trump's actions will affect our longtime ally as surely as they harm U.S. farmers.\n\nJapan and South Korea, two countries that along with Australia are the United States' strongest Asian allies, also have extensive trade ties with China. They are net exporters of capital goods, machinery and electronics, and chemicals to China. Again, any decrease in Chinese growth will reduce demand for these products, which in turn will harm their domestic economies.\n\nMost of these countries share U.S. concerns about Chinese growth in influence and military power, although Asian countries feel the effects more directly. Japan is increasing its own naval capacity to combat China's fast-growing navy, for example, and Australia banned Chinese companies such as Huawei as it develops its 5G network. They are not oblivious to the potential threat the communist government poses to their security, and they thus are inclined to back U.S. actions to restrain China's growth if it continues to act in irresponsible ways.\n\nBut almost all of these countries are also locked in their own trade battles with the United States, placing their cooperation in our fight with China in peril. Trump has also imposed or threatened to impose tariffs on goods from the E.U. and Japan. Those tariffs have pushed both Japan and the E.U. into trade talks with the United States, which are nowhere close to completion. Trump currently has to decide by May 18 whether he is going to impose more tariffs on automobile imports.\n\nThe fight with China is too large and too important for Trump to risk allied cooperation over U.S. trade disputes with our allies. European and Japanese competition may harm many U.S. industries, although as with all global trade, it also creates winners among U.S. firms and helps many consumers. More importantly, Japan and the E.U. do not pose a potential existential threat to the United States. Their militaries are small and rely on the United States for defense and intelligence. They are also free and democratic states and are not promoting an alternative social, political and economic system.\n\nChina will inevitably try to ratchet up the pressure on the United States if Trump holds firm. That will include more than just hurting U.S. farmers and exporters; it will include trying to woo U.S. allies with favorable deals to find alternatives to the United States. When that happens, Trump will need them to reject overtures that might be tempting and might be in those nation's and region's short-term interests. They will be much less likely to do that if they are embroiled in their own trade disputes with us.\n\nEven the United States is not large enough and powerful enough to fight the entire world at once. The global trading economy did not arise overnight, and it will not be reformed overnight. Chinese authoritarian expansion poses a unique and genuine national security threat to the United States and the entire free world. Trump should think strategically, make friends and strike favorable deals with our allies quickly in exchange for their cooperation in our battle with China.\n\nLawrence H.

Samuelson Robert J. Samuelson Columnist focusing on economics Columnist May 15 at 3:28 PM\n\nThe Trump administration is going about its trade war with China all wrong. Its strategy and tactics are muddled. If President Trump were a general watching the battle unfold, what he'd see is his troops getting slaughtered, while the enemy, though suffering casualties, was holding most of its positions.\n\nTrump has two goals, says William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a nonpartisan think tank. The first is to reduce the United States' huge goods trade deficit with China, which was $419 billion in 2018. As Reinsch notes, most economists discount the importance of this. If the deficit declines through temporary purchases from the United States, the effect may fade with time.\n\nTrump's second goal is more significant. It is to suppress the most anti-competitive aspects of China's state capitalism, which aims to make Chinese firms the world leaders in most high-technology industries. These include robotics, pharmaceuticals, autonomous vehicles, biomedicine, semiconductors and others. Here, the talks have failed.\n\nThe United States has claimed that Beijing has rigged the competition in favor of its firms through government subsidies, the theft or coerced transfers of new technologies and outright discrimination against foreign firms doing business in China.\n\nConsider semiconductors as a case in point. These are the tiny computer chips that govern virtually all digital services.\n\nAt present, U.S. firms are the world leaders in semiconductor design and technology, accounting for roughly half of all world revenue in chip sales (46 percent in 2017), according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), an industry trade group.\n\nOther countries lag, the SIA reports. South Korean firms are second with 22 percent of world sales, followed by companies from Japan at 10 percent, the European Union at 9 percent, Taiwan at 6 percent and China at 5 percent. The United States also has a trade surplus in semiconductors, which is the fourth largest U.S. export, behind aircraft, refined oil products and crude oil. In 2018, the U.S. trade surplus in semiconductors was $4.5 billion, says SIA.\n\nBut China has vowed to expand its global market share by constructing new semiconductor plants (called \"fabs\") and embracing the latest chip-making technologies. It's unclear how much, if at all, China plans rely on technologies stolen or coerced from U.S. firms. Late last year, the Justice Department indicted a Chinese firm, Fujian Jinhua, for allegedly stealing trade secrets from a major U.S. chipmaker, Micron.\n\nThe U.S. industry fears that a surge in subsidized Chinese chip-making plants will create surplus capacity that will drive down prices and profits, putting unsubsidized foreign firms at a huge disadvantage. That has been the pattern in older technologies such as steel, says the CSIS's Reinsch.\n\nThe trade negotiations have apparently made little headway in resolving these issues. Meanwhile, the tariffs that the United States has imposed on China's exports may hurt U.S. consumers. So far, the Trump administration has announced 25 percent tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese exports to the United States and has threatened higher tariffs on another $300 billion, covering virtually all Chinese exports to the United States.\n\nThe crucial question is who bears the burden of the higher prices created by the tariffs. According to Gary Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, U.S. consumers ultimately shoulder most costs. The tariffs simply get embedded in the products' final prices. Hufbauer estimates that if $500 billion in Chinese exports are hit with a 25 percent tariff, the annual cost for a three-person household would be $2,200. The existing tariffs cover about half of that. Hufbauer's estimate also assumes that, shielded from import competition, U.S.-based firms would raise some domestic prices.\n\nWhat the United States should have done is create a global coalition of major trading countries -- itself, the European Union, Japan and other advanced societies -- that would negotiate limits on subsidies, coerced technology transfers and a level playing field for competition between domestic and foreign firms. If China violated the rules and refused to join, the other countries could take action against its exports.\n\nBut this sensible approach was virtually eliminated when Trump decided to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that could have done just that. Instead, we have a system that, through high tariffs, imposes the equivalent of a tax on American citizens to implement a trade policy that favors China.\n\nRead more from Robert Samuelson's archive.\n\nLawrence H.

But at What Cost?", "body": "SYDNEY, Australia -- In a recent online discussion, Bill Shorten, the front-runner in the race to be Australia's next prime minister, left little doubt about where he stood on the politically delicate issue of relations with China -- and where the world's other superpower fit into his calculus.\n\n\"If I'm P.M., I welcome the rise of China in the world,\" he said in a post on the Chinese social media platform WeChat that was aimed at Australia's 1.2 million voters of Chinese descent. Mr. Shorten, the leader of the center-left Labor Party, added that he saw China not as a \"strategic threat,\" but as a \"strategic opportunity.\"\n\nThose words put him directly at odds with the Trump administration, which has sounded alarms about China's global ambitions and tactics. But Mr. Shorten, while acknowledging that Australia would always be an ally of the United States, declared that it was time for his nation \"to stand on its own feet and think for itself.\"\n\nIf Mr. Shorten's party prevails in Saturday's election, his embrace of China would represent a significant break from the current conservative Australian government, which has taken a harder line toward Beijing's growing influence in the country and whose leader, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, is an avowed admirer of President Trump. It could also signify a crack in the united front that the Trump administration is trying to build to check China's ascent.\n\nFor Mr. Shorten, the calculation may be largely about economics. The Labor leader, whose campaign has promised significant spending to bolster public health programs, education and wages, is hoping that improved relations with China, Australia's biggest trading partner, will keep the economy growing.\n\nMr. Morrison, whose conservative coalition has narrowed the gap with Mr. Shorten's Labor Party in polls but is still trailing, has focused his election message on the notion that Labor's spending plans would send the economy into a recession. That is a frightening prospect to Australians who have known only economic expansion for a generation.\n\nBut critics fear that any softening toward China could have much broader ramifications, putting pressure on Australia, for instance, to roll back its clampdown on foreign interference or to keep silent on Chinese human rights abuses.\n\nMr. Morrison's warier stance on China was crystallized by remarks he made on Monday when asked about the protracted trade war between Washington and Beijing. He said that he would not pick sides, saying, \"You stand by your friends, and you stand by your customers as well.\"\n\nThe prime minister's branding of China as a \"customer\" drew derision from Mr. Shorten, who promised \"a bit more sophistication\" in handling ties between the countries. For decades, Australia's economy has been buoyed by the export of natural resources to China, as well as money from Chinese students, tourists and investors.\n\nIt's clear which leader Chinese officials prefer: Social media accounts on WeChat affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party have mocked Mr. Morrison and his government. One account disparaged \"a country whose head has been kicked hard by kangaroos\" and now wanted to be friends again after a rough patch.\n\nRegardless of who wins the election, Australia will continue to face profound questions over how it balances the economic necessity of cooperating with China with the imperative of protecting its national security interests. Australia is also grappling with its place in the Asia-Pacific region, and the world beyond, as China seeks to expand its economic and military power.\n\nThe relationship between the two countries has grown strained in recent years as the Australian government, heeding warnings from national security leaders, has pushed back against Beijing's attempts to expand its reach within the country's corporations, universities and national institutions, including Parliament.\n\nThe Australian government passed legislation cracking down on foreign interference and secret lobbying on behalf of foreign interests. It also banned the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from seeking a contract to install fifth-generation cellular networks in Australia, citing potential threats to national security.\n\nBeijing, in turn, has held up Australian coal and wine imports, and is believed to be behind a cyberattack that infiltrated the networks of the federal Parliament and the three main political parties. (China has dismissed the hacking allegations as a smear campaign.)\n\nChina has also bypassed the federal government by signing deals with individual Australian states as part of its gargantuan Belt and Road infrastructure initiative -- a global push that the United States and other critics say has lacked transparency and trapped partners in debt.\n\nWhile it is seen as unlikely that Mr. Shorten, who declined requests for an interview, would reverse the government's ban on Huawei, his party has indicated that it is open to signing on to the Belt and Road program.\n\n\"The fact that Australia is this ally that sits geographically parked in the Asia-Pacific does put it very much in the cross hairs of China's worldview, particularly on the idea of splintering and weakening the U.S. alliance system,\" said Euan Graham, the executive director of La Trobe Asia, a department of La Trobe University in Melbourne.\n\nThe Labor Party has traditionally promoted itself as more independent of American foreign policy compared with the conservative coalition, which under Prime Minister John Howard sent Australian troops into Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Shorten said that Mr. Trump's views on some issues were \"barking mad.\" When asked by a television audience this year how he would reconcile those comments should he meet with Mr. Trump as prime minister, Mr. Shorten said he would deal with Mr. Trump \"professionally and politely.\"\n\n\"But you ask, China or America? In Australia, we're smart enough to work with all of them to Australia's long-term interest if we behave in a smart and respectful fashion,\" Mr. Shorten told the audience.\n\nTwo recent cases involving public figures with ties to Australia may offer a glimpse of how Mr. Shorten would carry out that \"respectful\" approach.\n\nMr. Shorten has been reluctant to publicly criticize China over its detention of a Chinese-Australian novelist, Yang Hengjun, saying the case should not be handled through \"megaphone diplomacy.\" But in the case of Bahraini soccer player Hakeem al-Araibi, who had been granted asylum in Australia, Mr. Shorten's party directly contacted the authorities in Thailand, where Mr. al-Araibi was being held, to urge his release.\n\nIf China senses a friendlier stance from a Labor government, human rights is likely to be one of the areas where it would try to push first, said Giovanni Di Lieto, an international trade law expert at Monash University in Melbourne.\n\n\"That will be the real litmus test,\" he said.\n\nMr. Shorten is hoping to shift the debate on the proper approach toward China, which has largely been driven by a sharp divide between the country's business community and its national security establishment.\n\nConnections to China run deep in the Labor Party, and have been a sore point at times. One of Mr. Shorten's mentors, former Prime Minister Paul Keating, was until recently the chairman of the advisory board for the China Development Bank, which has poured nearly $200 billion into Belt and Road projects.\n\nAnd Bob Carr, a former Labor foreign minister, has essentially become one of the Chinese government's most effective spokesmen, and now heads a university institute dedicated to Chinese-Australian relations.\n\nWhile the governing coalition has had its share of China-connected scandals as well, the shadows have been especially hard for Labor to cast off.\n\nDuring one election campaign debate, a coalition government minister began reeling off the names of past Labor politicians who had taken on Chinese-funded roles after leaving politics.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_tarabay@nytimes.com", "name": "Jamie Tarabay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/world/15oz-shorten-1/15oz-shorten-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4785042", "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 295642980}, {"uri": "1136731197", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-15", "time": "14:36:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-15T14:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/05/15/trump-says-he-knows-everything-hes-obviously-wrong/", "title": "Perspective | Trump says he knows everything.

Drezner is a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a regular contributor to PostEverything. May 15 at 10:15 AM\n\nWhen it comes to foreign affairs, President Trump is not cursed with the burden of knowledge. This was always pretty clear, but the point has come into sharper focus in the past week. As his trade war with China escalates, Trump continues to display a fundamental lack of comprehension about how the policies he's put in place work. He has repeatedly insisted that China pays for U.S. tariffs, even though every economist -- including his own adviser Larry Kudlow -- acknowledges this to be false. According to Axios, Trump's staffers are convinced he really believes it; one former staffer says it's \"like theology.\"\n\nA similar dynamic is playing out in the Middle East. In Iran, the Trump administration is increasing pressure; administration spokesmen and spokeswomen have brandished military threats and plans. Based on Trump's own comments, however, it is not clear he is aware of the implications of his foreign policy. When news broke about a Defense Department plan to deploy 120,000 troops to the Middle East if Iran were to escalate existing tensions, Trump simultaneously denied it but also suggested that \"if we did that, we would send a hell of a lot more troops.\"\n\nDespite our nation's superpower status, such threats from Trump keep leading to more conflict, rather than less. Perhaps, in some cases, more patience is required.\n\nOr maybe, just maybe, the president simply does not know what he is doing.\n\nIran and China are not easy portfolios for any commander in chief. Nonetheless, the standoffs with both countries -- either of which can easily worsen -- were entirely avoidable. Both situations show just how wrong things can go when the ultimate decision-maker for the government of the most powerful nation on Earth doesn't understand that he's boxed himself in. Trump declared during the 2016 campaign that \"I alone can fix\" the problems facing the country. What we're seeing now is the unfortunate counterpoint: He alone gets us into these new messes.\n\n[Trump is delivering what he promised: A government with no experts]\n\nUnlike any of his predecessors, Trump possessed zero experience in any branch or level of government when he arrived at the White House. His only previous contact with the legal system had been suing others and being sued, which did not prep him for the finer points of law. Trump has repeatedly commanded his staffers and Cabinet secretaries to do things that, as president, he has no legal authority to do. And in return, they have repeatedly mocked his knowledge deficits. Reince Priebus, John Kelly, Rex Tillerson, Steven Mnuchin and H.R. McMaster all reportedly called him some variation of \"idiot\" during their service in his administration. After leaving office, Tillerson explained: \"What was challenging for me coming from the disciplined, highly process-oriented ExxonMobil corporation, to go to work for a man who is pretty undisciplined, doesn't like to read, doesn't read briefing reports, doesn't like to get into the details of a lot of things, but rather just kind of says, 'This is what I believe.' \"\n\nIf Trump is the president with the least experience in government in American history, he is also the one most hostile to expert advice. Like a small child who thinks that no one is wise to his bluff, Trump has consistently claimed expertise on subjects that he clearly knows nothing about. During the 2016 campaign, Trump claimed that on foreign policy, \"my primary consultant is myself and I have a good instinct for this stuff.\" Despite Trump's rather limited tech savviness, he has claimed expertise about wind energy, the aeronautics of Boeing planes, and self-driving cars. He has repeatedly rejected the assessments provided to him from the U.S. intelligence community on security matters. He has spurned his economic advisers on foreign economic policy. The reason for the high turnover on his foreign policy team has been his refusal to listen to their counsel.\n\n[Trump made competence a dirty word. Now he has to settle for second-rate talent.]\n\nTrump's defenders might argue that the president's dealmaking abilities compensate for his lack of knowledge, that expert advisers can compensate for what the chief executive doesn't know on his own. These arguments do not hold up and mask considerable risks. Trump's lack of knowledge erodes his ability to lead. Indeed, his ignorance enables his subordinates to pursue policies that might be at variance with Trump's wishes. The president did not comprehend the veiled insults contained in outgoing defense secretary Jim Mattis's resignation letter because he did not read it until it was covered in the news media. In just the past few weeks, Trump has publicly reversed his own administration's actions on North Korea and the Special Olympics, unaware of policy initiatives until they were already in motion. As political scientist Elizabeth Saunders has demonstrated, inexperienced leaders are less able to constrain their subordinates from engaging in bureaucratic conflicts or pursuing risky actions. Their lack of experience and knowledge makes it more difficult for them to effectively monitor their subordinates, particularly when those subordinates have their own agenda. Saunders concludes that \"a base of substantive, domain-specific knowledge is important, and is distinct from procedural experience and acumen (such as good organizational or bargaining skills).\"\n\nWe see this at work in all the conflicts brewing this week. On Iran and Venezuela, Trump appears to be at the mercy of his hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, who is running point on both policies. Bolton has made some extraordinary threats, including calling out individual allies of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by name on Twitter. None of this has caused the Maduro regime to collapse, surprising Trump repeatedly. Bolton's bellicosity on Iran is based on intelligence that has failed to persuade U.S. allies of any escalation in the Iranian threat. One U.S. official told the New York Times that, \"the ultimate goal of the year-long economic sanctions campaign by the Trump administration was to draw Iran into an armed conflict with the United States\" -- a goal decidedly at odds with Trump's desire to extract the United States from wars in the Middle East. In his economic war with China, Trump's advisers are bound and determined to force U.S. allies into a binary choice between Washington and Beijing -- and Trump is blissfully unaware how that choice intersects with his other trade wars.\n\nThe real reason Trump likes to threaten is that he likes cheap victories. A successful threat can compel other countries into making concessions without incurring costs. Trump, like every other president, wants as many wins as possible. Unlike other presidents, however, Trump has no grasp of the need for threats to be credible. As some of us cautioned back in 2016, the president's bellicose rhetoric inevitably starts to wear thin after a while.\n\nIt is possible that the Trump administration will still manage to pressure some recalcitrant actors into submission. American power can be a great thing. It is not likely, however. Trump's demands on China, Iran and Venezuela are much greater than what earlier administrations have asked, which decreases the likelihood of any settlement. Some would argue that this merely reflects Trump's right sizing of U.S. priorities. The problem is that it is hard to square the notion of enduring great power conflict with a president who possesses large knowledge deficits and a limited attention span.\n\nUnburdened by any knowledge of history, Trump can serenely gamble on economic and military brinkmanship, convinced that his escalation dominance on Twitter translates into success on the global stage. Those of us who have studied these matters, however, see too many brush fires that can escalate into an uncontrollable blaze.\n\nKim Jong Un is the real artist of the deal, not Trump\n\nTrump thinks executing drug dealers would actually help. That's the problem.\n\nTrump tried to obstruct justice.

Trump startled financial markets with his May 5 announcement that U.S. tariffs would rise to 25% from 10% as of Friday.\n\nAfter negotiations in Washington ended last week with no agreement, China retaliated Monday with higher tariffs on $60 billion worth of American goods, raising duties of 5% to 25%.\n\nThen came the government's public relations onslaught.\n\n\"Overnight, we saw official media -- in the People's Daily, China Daily, CCTV -- all run spots about the United States as being a problematic negotiating partner,\" said Jake Parker, vice president of China operations for the U.S.-China Business Council.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping, the ruling party's most powerful leader in decades, has made China's foreign policy more assertive while nurturing the growth of a red-blooded but tightly controlled nationalism.\n\nThe approach reflects a new willingness to allow a shift in domestic public opinion where the trade war is concerned, Parker said.\n\nWeibo, a Twitter-like social media platform which generally censors political discourse, has featured an unusual amount of tariff-related content since Monday. The site's ranking of \"trending topics,\" usually dominated by celebrity news, highlighted Kang's monologue and the subject \"American stock market plunges.\"\n\nInternet users shared patriotic memes expressing confidence in China's economy and contempt for the U.S. The commentary echoes earlier times when the U.S. and China were adversaries in the Korean War and for decades afterward.\n\n\"All the trade wars are paper tigers,\" said a riff on a Communist propaganda poster showing People's Liberation Army soldiers stamping on a pile of skulls.

In the past, the government has paid people to publish posts supporting party policies, and any expression of dissent faces strict censorship.

A counter at the bottom of the post indicated that it had 1,290 comments, but none were viewable, and further comments were \"prohibited.\"\n\nA number of Chinese exporters contacted by The Associated Press refused to comment on the record because they fear government retribution.\n\nBeijing is trying to reassure worried Chinese businesses and consumers that the country is strong enough to withstand the trade conflict.\n\n\"I think this administration is different from previous ones in its diplomatic policies,\" said Li Chanjuan, a manager at an insurance company. \"People expect the government to make a tougher gesture.\"\n\nThere are limits to how far the party will go in pushing public sentiment.\n\nDavid Bandurski, a co-director of the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project, said the country's current aim is to promote stability rather than foment patriotic fervor.\n\n\"China is keen to project calm,\" he said. \"The last thing it needs or wants is to whip up popular anger, which can turn quickly,\" sometimes in ways that the party can neither predict nor control.\n\nPeople's Daily, the party's official mouthpiece, called the trade war \"no big deal.\" It also paid tribute to Jane Austen's famed novel \"Pride and Prejudice\" in a tongue-in-cheek critique of the Trump administration.\n\n\"Pride makes it impossible for other people to love me, while prejudice makes it impossible for me to love others.

That's not how it looks to some Americans.", "body": "By David J. Lynch David J. Lynch Financial writer covering trade and globalization May 14 at 8:06 PM\n\nThe first time President Trump took a swing at China, he hit a Seattle maker of electronic bicycles instead.\n\nThat was last summer, when the president imposed his first round of 25 percent tariffs on Chinese imports. The new levy meant a sharp cost increase for the e-bikes, tires, inner tubes and other components that Rad Power Bikes purchases from Chinese suppliers.\n\nAt first, Mike Radenbaugh, the company's co-founder, raised the retail price of his $1,500 e-bikes by $200. That cooled consumer demand, so Rad's management team overhauled the e-bikes' design and manufacturing process in a hunt for savings.\n\nBy February, Radenbaugh was able to return his retail prices to their original level, though at some cost in lost profits.\n\nToday, as Trump moves forward with plans for additional tariffs on Chinese products, the president insists that China is paying the tariff bill. But that's not how it looks from Radenbaugh's Seattle office.\n\n\"Our company has absorbed almost the entire burden,\" he said. \"It's been very frustrating. We just want to build a great bike at a great price.\"\n\nThe president's continued insistence that China is bearing the cost of his import taxes has become a notable and unusual feature of his \"America First\" trade offensive. Many industry groups and most economists describe tariffs as a tax on Americans, paid by the American companies that bring foreign goods into the United States.\n\nA pair of recent studies, by two teams of economists from institutions such as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as well as Princeton, Yale and Columbia universities, both concluded that Americans are bearing nearly the entire cost of Trump's tariffs.\n\nBut speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House on Tuesday, the president said the United States is \"winning\" the trade war with China, adding: \"We're going to be collecting over $100 billion in tariffs.\"\n\nThe Treasury Department estimates that total customs duties will be about $69 billion for the current fiscal year.\n\nTrump said he is considering \"very strongly\" the imposition of tariffs up to 25 percent on roughly $300 billion in Chinese products that are not covered by previous levies.\n\nPresident Trump stops to talk to reporters and members of the media as he walks from the Oval Office to Marine One to depart from the South Lawn at the White House on Tuesday, May 14, 2019. He said the United States is \"winning\" the trade war with China. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nIf he opts to proceed -- and he took the first official step toward doing so on Monday -- the economic impact will dwarf his previous levies on foreign washing machines, solar panels, industrial metals and about half of what the United States purchases each year from China.\n\nOnce in place, the tariffs would cost the typical family of four nearly $2,400 annually, destroy 2.2 million jobs and shave more than $200 billion from the size of the economy, according to a study for an anti-tariff group by Trade Partnership Worldwide, a Washington-based consultancy.\n\n\"Generally, the big impact on prices is here at home. It's basically a tax on consumers,\" said Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who has studied tariff episodes dating to the 1970s.\n\nThe economywide figures mask countless boardroom decisions made at large and small companies across the country about how to respond whenever the government imposes a new tariff on imported products.\n\nIn most industries, it's an unfamiliar exercise. No president since the 1930s has used tariffs as freely as Trump. Occasionally, presidents have deployed them to protect individual industries, such as President George W. Bush's move to safeguard the steel industry in 2003 or President Barack Obama's aid for domestic tire makers in 2009.\n\nBut ever since the Smoot-Hawley tariffs in 1930 were blamed for deepening the Great Depression, most presidents have sought to lower trade barriers, not raise them.\n\nA new tariff, particularly one of the magnitude that Trump is discussing, poses a complex calculus for a company. If the government imposes a 25 percent tariff on goods from China, the cost of a $100 Chinese good rises to $125. The additional $25 is paid to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Service by the American broker that represents the domestic company buying the product.\n\nThen, the company can choose whether to accept smaller profits and pay the tariff itself. Or it can raise its retail prices and make its customers pay. Finally, it can try to persuade its Chinese supplier to accept a lower price for its product.\n\nThat decision will turn on basic economic issues such as supply, demand and competition.\n\nIf the American company makes something that its customers could find elsewhere -- perhaps from a maker that is unaffected by the Chinese tariff -- it won't be able to raise its selling price to cover the tariff.\n\nAfter all, its customers could just go elsewhere.\n\nLikewise, if the American company could buy its product from a supplier in, say, Vietnam or Bangladesh rather than China, the Chinese supplier might decide to eat the tariff cost rather than see its American customer defect.\n\n\"It can change by product and by industry,\" said Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who was a White House economist in the George W. Bush administration.\n\nAt Rad Power Bikes, Radenbaugh couldn't quickly switch to a non-Chinese supplier. China produces almost all the e-bikes sold globally, leaving retailers with few immediate options. The young executive, an evangelist for e-bikes as an alternative mode of transport, also wanted to pour his profits into new investment to feed the fast-growing business.\n\nThat left only the consumer to pay the tab.\n\nRad's dilemma bore little relationship to the reassuring statements coming from the White House. Trump -- who has dubbed himself \"Tariff Man\" on Twitter -- has repeatedly said that China is paying the tariff bill.\n\nHe occasionally has been more specific, arguing that China pays 21 percentage points of the current 25 percent tariff -- a breakdown that appears to come from a 2018 simulation by a pair of Swiss and German economists, Benedikt Zoller-Rydzek and Gabriel Felbermayr.\n\nBut unlike the two U.S. studies that recently concluded Americans paid nearly the entire tab, the German-Swiss paper did not examine real-world results in the wake of the president's tariff measures.\n\nRobert E. Lighthizer, the president's chief trade negotiator, has suggested that the tariffs' financial pain is worth the potential gains involved in resetting the U.S. economic relationship with China.\n\nBeijing's rampant theft of American technology, through coercive joint ventures and cyberhacking, poses an \"existential\" threat to U.S. economic leadership, he says. The tariffs are designed to compel China to abandon those practices.\n\nTrump began his day Tuesday tweeting that \"Tariffs have rebuilt our Steel Industry.\" And before leaving for a quick trip to Louisiana later in the day, he said that U.S. companies could easily escape the financial sting of his anti-China trade measures.\n\n\"So you have no tariff to pay whatsoever if you're a business,\" Trump said. \"All you have to do is build or make your product in the United States. There's no tariff whatsoever. So that really works out very well.\"\n\nEconomists and some executives say the president's view overlooks the difficulties involved in switching to new suppliers, as well as the erosion of U.S. supply networks over the past quarter-century of globalization and automation.\n\nIn some cases, the necessary domestic manufacturing infrastructure does not exist.\n\n\"It's very frustrating to hear we should bring manufacturing back. .\u2009.\u2009. It's impossible to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. if it never existed here to begin with,\" Radenbaugh said.\n\nRad's e-bikes are assembled in a Chinese factory near Shanghai, in the heart of an industrial cluster Radenbaugh calls \"bike valley.\" Matching the trained workforce and robust factory networks that dot the Chinese landscape would take the United States \"decades,\" he said.\n\n\"We could invest millions and millions of dollars and get just trickle of e-bikes,\" he added.\n\nFor now, the tariffs are not crippling the e-bike company. But they are sapping money that could be used to hire more workers to fill some of Rad's existing vacancies or to finance expansion.\n\n\"Business is good. We're not going to let this thing slow us down,\" Radenbaugh said. \"It's just hard to stomach that we're being nailed by this tax.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VixtJbpSJJUbBKl_3lZ-R2dhxNc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WSRITWTWMUI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4787712", "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 295621740}, {"uri": "1136626824", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-15", "time": "12:29:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-15T12:29:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5529412031173706, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/15/the-energy-202-trump-promotes-natural-gas-as-it-gets-caught-up-in-u-s-china-trade-war/5cdad9751ad2e544f001dd12/", "title": "Analysis | The Energy 202: Trump promotes natural gas as it gets caught up in U.S.-China trade war", "body": "It is supposed to yet again be Infrastructure Week. President Trump went down to southwest Louisiana to talk up his administration's effort to open U.S. natural gas to international markets.\n\nBut yet again, Trump went off script, using an official White House event at a natural gas export terminal in Hackberry, La. to overtly attacks his political rivals all while the the administration's trade policies threaten the growth of the very natural gas export business Trump went to Louisiana to promote.\n\nDuring the 50-minute speech, Trump was flanked by dozens of plant workers onstage as he touted his energy agenda and made the case that he was turbocharging the economy, Seung Min Kim and I reported Tuesday.\n\nBut the natural gas business Trump was there to support just got even more knotted up in Trump's trade war with China. Officials there announced the country is raising tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent on U.S. liquefied natural gas.\n\nThat has some of those in the natural gas export business concerned. \"The U.S. is largest natural gas producer in the world, so the two sides deadlocked in a trade dispute its not a great piece of news,\" Charlie Riedl, executive director of the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, told the Houston Chronicle.\n\nOnly four cargos of natural gas have been delivered to China from the United States during the eight-month period since tariffs were first put on the fuel last September, according to a new report from the consultancy Wood Mackenzie. That compares 35 cargos during that prior September-April period.\n\nBut little of that tension was directly on display during Trump's speech in Louisiana, where energy executives heaped praise on Trump. \"This administration and its forward-looking energy policies deserve a lot of credit,\" Jeffrey Martin, chief executive of Sempra Energy, the majority owner of the Cameron LNG export facility, said before Trump's speech.\n\nTrump, for his part, was happy to take the credit, claiming \"this was not going to happen with someone else in office.\"\n\nTrump mainly used the taxpayer-funded event to attack his political rivals. He drew out the pronunciation of Pete Buttigieg's uncommon last name, saying: \"We've got Boot-edge-edge.\" Using a derisive nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the president mused: \"Pocahontas, I think, is probably out.\"\n\nTrump also said former vice president Joe Biden \"doesn't look like the guy I knew\" while taking aim at \"crazy\" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has a \"lot more energy than Biden .\u2009.\u2009. but it's energy to get rid of your jobs.\"\n\nAnd finally, Trump ridiculed former congressman Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.) for a Vanity Fair interview in which O'Rourke claimed that he was \"just born to be in\" the presidential race.\n\n\"He was made to fall like a rock!\" Trump said.\n\nThe president also mocked the Green New Deal, telling the crowd of plant workers that they would lose their jobs under the proposal advanced by some Democrats and saying: \"That's a hoax, like the hoax I just went through,\" an apparent reference to the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\n-- House unveils budget bills: House Democrats released spending bills for the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy and Interior departments. Here's what you need to know:\n\n-- The latest on the impasse over disaster funding: Congressional negotiators say they are close to a deal on a much-anticipated disaster aid bill to include mroe spending for Puerto Rico, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced a vote is set for next week. There's still no final deal on the $17 billion package and also no green light from the White House, The Post's Erica Werner and Jeff Stein report. But they add the measure is expected to include about $300 million in additional community block grant funds for Puerto Rico in addition to $600 million for the U.S. territory's food stamp program.\n\nSome signaled a light at the end of the funnel: \"We're going to vote next week. I tell you from my point of view, I've had it,\" said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). \"I don't mind helping Puerto Rico more, it's got to be reasonable, but enough with the drama on disaster aid. I think you're going to see a jailbreak here.\"\n\nBut still more hurdles: \"Concluding negotiations centered on some other issues, including whether a final deal would incorporate portions of the Trump administration's recent $4.5 billion emergency spending request for the U.S.-Mexico border,\" they write. \"Democrats sounded open to including some elements of the border request, specifically those focused on humanitarian aid to address the high numbers of Central American families and minors seeking entry into the United States.\"\n\n-- Biden's climate challenge: As the former vice president faces an early test of his policies, he is pushing back on criticism of his reported climate plan.\n\nHours before activists panned Biden's \"middle-of-the road\" policy at a rally hosted by youth climate activist group Sunrise Movement, Biden spoke to a group of reporters in New Hampshire, defending his record on the issue. He called the Reuters story outlining his climate policies \"dead wrong,\" as The Post's John Wagner, David Weigel and Matt Viser report. \"This is no time to turn back,\" Biden said. \"I've been saying for years that this is an existential threat that requires a green revolution. And it does. It does .\u2009.\u2009. There's no one who's been stronger and more effective, I would respectfully suggest to you, on climate and the environment than me. Nobody.\"\n\nBiden has played up his feats as VP: \"During his remarks in New Hampshire, Biden, as he has on several issues during his first few weeks as a candidate, pointed to the accomplishments during the Obama administration,\" Wagner, Weigel and Viser write. \"He cited investments made in clean energy as part of economic stimulus legislation, as well as an increase in the fuel efficiency standards for passenger vehicles.\"\n\n-- House reups flood insurance program ahead of hurricane season: The House passed by voice vote an extension of the National Flood Insurance Program before it was set to expire at the end of the month. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chair of the House Financial Services Committee who co-authored the extension, said lawmakers have passed short-term extensions of the program 10 time since 2017, The Hill reports. The bill passed Tuesday would extend the program through Sept. 30. In a statement, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said it was critical to extend the program ahead of the next hurricane season and said he would work with lawmakers on a long-term reauthorization plan.\n\n-- Deal could come soon on steel tariffs: Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said he believes U.S. and Canadian officials are working toward an agreement to end the steel and aluminum import tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. \"That's my understanding. And [there's] even the possibility of some face-to-face talks very soon. And maybe in 48 hours I'll have a more definitive answer for you,\" Politico reports.\n\n-- A formal FEMA nod: The White House has officially sent the nomination to the Senate of Jeffrey Byard to lead the Federal Emergency Management Agency, AL.com reports. Byard is the agency's associate administrator for response and recovery and previously worked for the Alabama Emergency Management Agency. The role of FEMA administrator has been vacant for three months, following the resignation of Brock Long in February.\n\n-- Man, it's a hot one: Over the weekend, the temperature near the Arctic Ocean spiked to 84 degrees Fahrenheit, a reading that was posted in Arkhangelsk, Russia. \"This particular heat wave, while a manifestation of the arrangement of weather systems and fluctuations in the jet stream, fits into what has been an unusually warm year across the Arctic and most of the mid-latitudes,\" The Post's Jason Samenow reports.

(Eric Risberg/AP) By Jessica Chen Weiss May 15 at 7:45 AM\n\nU.S.-China trade talks ended Friday without a deal. The United States increased tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, and Beijing retaliated Monday by announcing it would enact new tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods. Although China's response was proportionate, state media also unleashed a barrage of nationalist rhetoric.\n\nA video clip from Xinwen Lianbo, China's most watched nightly news broadcast, went viral: \"If the U.S. wants to talk, our door is open ... If the U.S. wants to fight, we'll be with them till the end.\" Mentions of a \"trade war\" on Chinese media have spiked, suggesting that government censors have loosened the reins on coverage of the U.S.-China standoff.\n\nWhat does this renewed surge in strident Chinese commentary mean for the ongoing U.S.-China trade fight? Here are three things to watch.\n\n1. Beijing is rolling out the nationalist propaganda. The Chinese government appears to be preparing the public for a protracted and costly trade war, resisting what it calls U.S. \"bullying.\" At the same time, Vice Premier Liu He made it clear after the Friday talks ended that Beijing remains open to a deal that gives enough \"dignity\" to the Chinese side.\n\nBy proclaiming that China will fight to the end and invoking the nation's experience with hardship over 5,000 years of history, the Chinese government is likely trying to shore up popular resolve for a long and painful trade war, should the Trump administration refuse to relent. Broadcasting that the government is standing up to U.S. pressure sets the stage for the Chinese government to blame the nation's economic pain on U.S. tariffs.\n\n[No, China and the U.S. aren't locked in an ideological battle. Not even close.]\n\n2. The Chinese government may be open to creative ways out of this stalemate. The barrage of nationalist propaganda need not prevent the Chinese leadership from agreeing to a future deal, which President Trump has said could happen \"much faster than people think.\"\n\nThe Chinese leadership has often looked for ways to move past disputes that became rhetorically heated. After a Chinese fighter jet rammed a U.S. EP-3 spy plane off China's coast in 2001, the Chinese government celebrated the downed pilot as a martyr -- but prevented anti-American demonstrations in China. Ultimately, Beijing released the crew and relented on its demand for a formal apology from the George W. Bush administration, accepting \"very sorry\" instead.\n\nDuring a more recent spat with South Korea over the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system, the Chinese government patched up relations with Seoul even though the system remains in place.\n\nNationalist rhetoric and propaganda make it harder for the Chinese government to make concessions in public, but creative wording and diplomatic finesse can often allow the government to save face at the end of the day.\n\n[40 years later, U.S.-China relations are rocky. Or not.]\n\nSome of the Chinese government's rhetoric could be bluster. In a forthcoming article in International Studies Quarterly, my co-author and I find that tough but ultimately vague talk in international disputes can boost domestic support for the Chinese government -- even if that rhetoric was ultimately unaccompanied by further action.\n\nOur survey experiments with Chinese Internet users in 2015-2016 invoked a different context -- a dispute over whether foreign aircraft can operate freely in the airspace off China's coast. But the results of this survey suggest that strident nationalist rhetoric can bolster domestic approval for the Chinese government, even without real action.\n\n3. Will we see anti-American boycotts and protests in China? The sharp escalation in rhetoric from Beijing has triggered speculation from some U.S. commentators that anti-U.S. protests could be imminent.\n\nThe Chinese government is unlikely to unleash or incite popular anger in this way, particularly given the proximity to the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown. President Xi Jinping's style also favors state-led nationalism over grass-roots activism -- and public demonstrations make the government wary.\n\n[Here's what China's people really think about the South China Sea]\n\nSince Xi took the helm in 2012, the Chinese government has not tolerated anti-foreign street demonstrations of any appreciable size, despite rhetorical broadsides against perceived transgressions by the Philippines, Vietnam and South Korea, among other nations. Street-level nationalism could make it harder for Beijing to make a deal while striking that delicate balance between offering concessions and also appearing to defend the nation's dignity.\n\nThat said, if the Chinese government does tolerate or encourage anti-American protests going forward, it will mark a new phase in the trade war and significant escalation in the U.S.-China standoff. When anti-Japanese protests spread to almost 200 cities across China in 2012, the commercial casualties were enormous. In a working paper, my co-authors and I estimate that sales of Japanese brands fell by 1.1 million in the automobile industry alone, and that the effect lasted for several years. The boycott effect was strongest in cities that witnessed anti-Japanese protests.\n\nSo far, Chinese consumers have been less than enthusiastic about sacrificing their iPhones and fast-food habits on the altar of U.S.-China trade frictions. As those trade \"tensions\" escalate to a full-fledged trade \"war\" in the Chinese news media, that could change.\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nTrump appears to believe incorrectly that China, rather than U.S. consumers and businesses that use Chinese inputs, is paying for the tariffs. But the Chinese government seems willing to resist Trump's threats and punitive tariffs so far. A Xinhua commentary even invoked a Korean War-era statement by Chairman Mao: \"However long the U.S. wants to fight, we will fight, until we have achieved complete victory.\"\n\nDon't miss anything!

But on K Street, the trade war is already proving a winner for the bottom line.\n\nBy more than doubling the duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and threatening to extend that 25 percent levy to everything imported from the country, the Trump administration has created a new crowd of companies desperate for relief and lining up to hire Washington's most connected operators to help. The hope: To convince the U.S. Trade Representative to exclude their product from the new tariffs.\n\n\"There's a lot of activity and a lot of concerned companies out there,\" says Ronald Oleynik, who leads the international trade practice at Holland & Knight.\n\nRichard Mojica, who focuses on imports at Miller & Chevalier, said he is fielding an \"avalanche of inquiries, from both existing clients and new clients who up until very recently have not had to deal with the tariffs or deal with them as urgently as they have to right now.\"\n\nEarly rounds of Trump's tariffs -- on steel and aluminum imports from around the world and mostly industrial products from China that end up in other finished goods -- fell heavily on American manufacturers. But as the administration moves to broaden the levies to include everything imported from the country nicknamed the world's factory, new classes of American businesses stand to feel a stronger pinch, including toy makers, big-box retailers and apparel companies.\n\nThe record suggests there will be only so much even the best lawyers and lobbyists can do. Although companies seeking carve-outs from steel and aluminum tariffs have racked up an impressive success rate -- winning exemptions for 42 percent of the more than 51,000 requests filed as of March -- those seeking relief from China tariffs have a considerably lower batting average. Rough calculations by Christine McDaniel and Danielle Parks of the Mercatus Center found as of March, U.S. Trade Representative officials had approved only about 10 percent of nearly 11,000 requests for exclusion from the import taxes.\n\nFor those companies nevertheless eager to challenge the odds, top trade hands for hire have some advice. First, any business seeking an exemption needs to marshal the best version of the facts supporting their case to present to USTR. The trade office requires petitioners to prove the product they want exempted meets four standards: It is not key to Chinese industrial policy, including its Made in China 2025 plan; it can't be produced elsewhere; subjecting it to higher tariffs would cause severe damage to the company; and customs officers need to be able to identify the product easily so they can enforce the exemption.\n\n\"If you don't hit any one of these factors, if you don't answer the question in a definitive way,\" companies stand a vastly diminished shot at approval, says Stacy J. Ettinger, who directs the trade policy practice at K&L Gates.\n\nOnce the paperwork is in order, it helps to have friends in your congressional delegation adding their names to the cause. \"They do make better advocates than most people,\" Oleynik says. \"When a senator calls the White House or USTR, they get more attention. Using that leverage is helpful. But they've got to want to do it.\"\n\nIndeed, Tesla failed to win an exemption for the Chinese-built Autopilot \"brain\" of its electric vehicles, with USTR pointing to the technology's strategic importance to the Made in China 2025 plan. Mojica says his firm couldn't win an exemption for a blender, because 5 percent of them were made in Brazil -- a fact USTR cited in rejecting the claim the device had to be made in China. But he secured carve-outs for other low-tech products, including ball bearings and a salad spinner.\n\nGiven the dismal success rate for companies seeking exemptions from China tariffs so far, Oleynik also proposes a different path altogether. Companies can seek deductions to the valuation that customs officers place on their imports, thereby shrinking the tab subject to the new tariffs. Shipping costs, for example, are deductible. Or the Chinese exporter can set up a sales subsidiary in the U.S. and effectively claim a wholesale price for the product when it is imported before selling it to an American customer.\n\nOptions for importers may range from bad to worse. But lobbyists are still benefiting from all the increased action. In the first quarter of this year alone, 723 clients reported lobbying on trade matters, following a record-breaking year for trade lobbying in 2018, when nearly 1,300 clients worked federal officials on the issue, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\n\"It just doesn't seem to be a very fair process,\" McDaniel of the Mercatus Center says. \"We talk to so many companies, and it's heartbreaking: They can't afford the K Street lawyer, not to mention the PR firm and the full-court press on their senator or representative. Sometimes a company gets an exclusion granted. But what about the hundreds of others who can't afford to try?\"\n\n-- Stocks bounce back. Bloomberg's Randall Jensen and Sarah Ponczek: \"U.S. stocks rebounded as [Trump] moved to reassure markets that he'll clinch a trade deal with China. The dollar rose and Treasuries fell. The S&P 500 rose for the second time in three sessions after Trump said he's talking with China. The benchmark is still down around 4% since the president escalated the trade war on May 5, and Tuesday's rally faded into the close. Battered tech shares led the advance as Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. bounced back from their biggest one-day declines since January. Heavyweight exporters Caterpillar Inc. and Boeing Co. also reversed a portion of Monday's losses.\"\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\nTrump's trade war is about 2020: \"[Trump] is telling advisers and close allies that he has no intention of pulling back on his escalating trade war with China, arguing that clashing with Beijing is highly popular with his political base and will help him win reelection in 2020 regardless of any immediate economic pain,\" my colleagues Robert Costa, Josh Dawsey and Sean Sullivan report.\n\nChina is not flinching: The Chinese Foreign Ministry had a message for the U.S. on Tuesday: Don't underestimate us.\n\nBlankfein: Tariffs could work. The former Goldman Sachs CEO took to Twitter to argue Trump's strategy could help him achieve his goal of bringing China to heel:\n\nYes, China could dump Treasuries. Bloomberg's Liz McCormick and Saleha Mohsin write that the so-called nuclear option for Chinese retaliation is in fact on the table. \"The idea that China would dump its $1.1 trillion of Treasuries to retaliate against U.S. tariffs is often dismissed as improbable... Yet the tensions rippling through global financial markets could still lead Beijing to reduce its stockpile in the $15.9 trillion Treasuries market -- not to retaliate, but to defend its currency if it goes into a free-fall.\"\n\n-- Americans are running up credit card debt: \"More than half of U.S. consumers in their twenties own a credit card. As that number has increased in recent years, so have delinquency rates,\" Bloomberg News's Shelly Hagan and Marie Patino report.\n\n\"The move into serious delinquency rates for credit cards is a fairly new occurrence. It's been rising since only 2017 whereas payments on auto loans that were at least 90 days late have trended upwards since 2012.\"\n\n-- Uber is not happy with Morgan Stanley: \"Morgan Stanley nabbed the biggest U.S. initial public offering of the past five years. Now it gets to field the second-guessing after Uber Technologies Inc. tumbled 18% in its first two days of trading,\" Bloomberg News's Eric Newcomer, Sonali Basak and Sridhar Natarajan report.\n\n\"The debate over how well Morgan Stanley and other banks handled the marquee offering is complicated by a lot of bad luck, including the abrupt flareup last week in U.S.-China trade negotiations that drove markets down around the globe, as well as the recent dismal performance of Uber's main rival, Lyft Inc. There's also a broad, gnawing concern about Silicon Valley's penchant for delaying public listings until startups achieve full size: Who's left to buy?\"\n\n-- Alice Rivlin, budget maestro, dies at 88: \"Alice M. Rivlin, a master of budgetary policy who held senior positions in the executive and legislative branches of government -- notably as founding director of the Congressional Budget Office -- and whose stewardship of the D.C.

Povich writes in The Post's obit.\n\n\"'She was the decathlete of public policy,' said Robert Reischauer, an economist who helped Dr. Rivlin set up the Congressional Budget Office in 1975 and later headed the agency...\n\n\"As head of the Congressional Budget Office from 1975 to 1983, Dr. Rivlin weathered intense political head winds and set the agency on course to be Congress's highly respected arbiter of fiscal policy.

From 1996 to 1999, she was vice chair of the Federal Reserve.\"\n\n-- Wyden wants info on Trump's taxes: Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) is pressing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about why the department turned down House Democrats' request for Trump's personal and some business-related tax returns. \"In a letter released Tuesday, [Wyden] asked [Mnuchin] to turn over any communications his agency has had with the White House or Trump's personal lawyers related to Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal's (D-Mass.) request last month for the returns,\" Politico's Brian Faler reports.\n\n\"The letters come one day before Mnuchin and Rettig are slated to appear before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the Treasury Department's annual budget request.\"\n\n-- Calabria claims power to end government control of Fannie and Freddie.

Trump startled financial markets with his May 5 announcement that U.S. tariffs would rise to 25% from 10% as of Friday.\n\nAfter negotiations in Washington ended last week with no agreement, China retaliated Monday with higher tariffs on $60 billion worth of American goods, raising duties of 5% to 25%.\n\nThen came the government's public relations onslaught.\n\n\"Overnight, we saw official media -- in the People's Daily, China Daily, CCTV -- all run spots about the United States as being a problematic negotiating partner,\" said Jake Parker, vice president of China operations for the U.S.-China Business Council.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping, the ruling party's most powerful leader in decades, has made China's foreign policy more assertive while nurturing the growth of a red-blooded but tightly controlled nationalism.\n\nThe approach reflects a new willingness to allow a shift in domestic public opinion where the trade war is concerned, Parker said.\n\nWeibo, a Twitter-like social media platform which generally censors political discourse, has featured an unusual amount of tariff-related content since Monday. The site's ranking of \"trending topics,\" usually dominated by celebrity news, highlighted Kang's monologue and the subject \"American stock market plunges.\"\n\nInternet users shared patriotic memes expressing confidence in China's economy and contempt for the U.S. The commentary echoes earlier times when the U.S. and China were adversaries in the Korean War and for decades afterward.\n\n\"All the trade wars are paper tigers,\" said a riff on a Communist propaganda poster showing People's Liberation Army soldiers stamping on a pile of skulls. The poster alludes to Mao Zedong's famous pronouncement that \"All reactionaries are paper tigers\" -- a derogatory term which he also applied to American imperialism.\n\nStill, the nationalistic bent of social media comment is an imperfect measure of Chinese public opinion. In the past, the government has paid people to publish posts supporting party policies, and any expression of dissent faces strict censorship. A number of Chinese exporters contacted by The Associated Press refused to comment on the record because they fear government retribution.\n\nThe government is trying to reassure worried Chinese businesses and consumers that the country is strong enough to withstand the trade conflict.\n\n\"I think this administration is different from previous ones in its diplomatic policies,\" said Li Chanjuan, a manager at an insurance company. \"People expect the government to make a tougher gesture.\"\n\nThere are limits to how far the party will go in goading public outrage.\n\nDavid Bandurski, a co-director of the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project, said the country's current aim is to promote stability rather than foment patriotic fervor.\n\n\"China is keen to project calm,\" he said. \"The last thing it needs or wants is to whip up popular anger, which can turn quickly\" in ways that that the party can neither predict or control.\n\nPeople's Daily, the party's official mouthpiece, called the trade war \"no big deal.\" It also paid tribute to Jane Austen's famed novel \"Pride and Prejudice\" in a tongue-in-cheek critique of the Trump administration.\n\n\"Pride makes it impossible for other people to love me, while prejudice makes it impossible for me to love others. Today a few American politicians are just like the characters that Austen assailed,\" the paper said.\n\nCCTV on Wednesday aired interviews with both Chinese and American economists who condemned the U.S.'s approach. The state broadcaster also emphasized how the tariffs will hurt American consumers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hainan Tilapia Sustainability Alliance, an industry group on the southern island province, is appealing to Chinese taste buds.\n\nChina's exports of the popular fish are a target of Trump's tariffs.\n\nIn an article calling for Chinese consumers to eat more tilapia to help the industry survive, the group said: \"There's no problem that eating cannot solve.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Yanan Wang on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yananw.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Then the Fighting Resumed.", "body": "LONDON -- In ordinary times, worries about the health of the global economy tend to prompt leaders of the largest countries to join forces in pursuit of safety.\n\nThese are not ordinary times.\n\nThe biggest threat to global fortunes has become the intensifying conflict between the two largest economies on earth, the United States and China. As their leaders openly contemplate how to inflict pain on each other, the rest of the world now frets about becoming collateral damage in an escalating trade war.\n\nOnly a week ago, China and the United States appeared to be moving toward cooling their hostilities, while global economic prospects were improving. Worries about a worldwide slowdown were giving way to burnished hopes for expansion.\n\nFears about the weakening of China's economy were easing as President Trump advertised a soon-to-be-signed trade deal. That lifted the outlook for Asian economies dependent on global commerce like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Europe, a perpetual source of concern, was flashing signs of renewal. Defying skeptics, the American economy remained on a tear.\n\nBut late last week, as Mr. Trump sharply increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, the world found itself grappling with the likelihood that the trade war will cost treasure. The concern mounted on Monday as Beijing retaliated and the Trump administration detailed plans to slap 25 percent tariffs on virtually all goods that China sends to the United States.\n\nFor businesses and consumers alike, it all raised the prospect that they would soon be paying higher prices for goods, a reality that discourages commerce.\n\n\"An escalation scenario would be terrible all around,\" said Gabriel Sterne, head of global macro research at Oxford Economics in London. \"A negative impact on trade flow is going to be bad for global growth for several years. It's bad news for almost everybody.\"\n\nIf both sides follow through on their threatened tariffs, China's annual economic output will be reduced by 0.8 percent while the United States will see its annual growth reduced by 0.3 percent, according to Oxford Economics.\n\nThose numbers are small in the grand scheme of things, but the pain could be felt acutely within industries that are especially exposed to the trade war, such as American agriculture and Chinese electronics manufacturers.\n\nThe harm could be especially severe for countries that are most dependent on trade, including Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico and Japan.\n\nAt the center of trouble sits China, the world's most populous country. Its breakneck development over recent decades has added hundreds of millions of consumers to the global marketplace while supplying a vast assemblage of low-cost goods.\n\nGiven that China is the source of roughly one-third of the world's economic growth, any disruption to its trade amounts to a global event.\n\nMr. Trump has designed his tariffs to wound China as he seeks to pressure its leaders to agree to cease subsidizing state-owned companies, stop demanding intellectual property from American businesses and open its markets to foreign competitors. Until last week, the president was insisting that a trade deal with China was imminent. Then, he abruptly accused China of reneging on its commitments and opted to increase tariffs.\n\nThe sharp escalation comes at an especially fraught time for the world economy, jeopardizing what had seemed to be a stabilizing, if gradually slowing Chinese economy.\n\nVolumes of freight imported by China surged in April, according to an analysis of data by UBS, the global investment bank. Worldwide, airfreight was up in March compared with a year earlier, according to the International Air Transport Association.\n\nBut these trends are fragile. Airfreight has declined nearly 4 percent since its peak in 2017. Outside China, manufacturing in Asia has been slowing for much of the last two years. A trade war between the United States and China -- two countries that collectively account for roughly 40 percent of world economic output -- would almost certainly aggravate the situation.\n\nExports to China from Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam have plunged by about 14 percent over the past year, or about $6.3 billion, according to analysis from Oxford Economics.\n\nThose same countries have lifted their exports to the United States by a similar percentage. But the United States is a less important trading partner, and the increase amounts to less than $2 billion.\n\nIn Europe, the trade war presents another unwanted source of concern at a time of tenuous progress.\n\nConcerns that Britain's unruly departure from the European Union would damage trade across the continent had abated -- at least in the immediate term -- as London and Brussels agreed to extend their fractious divorce proceedings until the end of October.\n\nGermany, the Continent's largest economy, had been moderating fears of weakness, with data showing an increase in factory orders and exports. Germany's exports to China were up by more than 5 percent in March compared with a year earlier.\n\nBut much of what Germany sends China amounts to the piece parts of China's industrial apparatus -- car parts, engines, electrical machinery and other gear folded into factory operations. If Chinese factory operations slow in the face of American tariffs, China's appetite for German goods will most likely wane.\n\nIn Italy and France, industrial activity has been weakening in recent months.\n\n\"For Europe, it's happening at a very delicate point in time,\" said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Norway. \"You have growth being very feeble again.\"\n\nThe trade war has already spooked global stock markets, prompting plunges in share prices that slightly reversed on Tuesday.\n\nIf investor fear deepens, money will almost certainly flow into the ultimate safe haven, the American dollar. That would most likely be accompanied by money leaving so-called emerging markets, exacerbating crises in Argentina and Turkey, while bringing down the value of currencies more broadly, from Brazil to South Africa to India.\n\nFalling currencies make imported goods more expensive in those countries, forcing poor people to pay more for food, fuel and transportation.\n\nAfter rising early this year, currencies and stock prices across emerging markets have dipped precipitously in recent weeks.\n\nThe key question now is how long trade hostilities will endure.\n\nIt is a question with no clear answer.\n\nMr. Trump appears to be taking resolve from a strong American economy as he declares a willingness to absorb the strains of a drawn-out battle with China. The unemployment rate sits at 3.6 percent, its lowest level in half a century. The economy expanded at a 3.2 percent annual clip during the first three months of the year.\n\nMr. Trump has declared that the United States can win a trade war if it stays the course. Yet he has also used Twitter to complain that the Federal Reserve is not cutting interest rates while China's leaders stimulate their economy with injections of credit.\n\nPerhaps that represents his lobbying for lower rates. It can also be read as an admission that Mr. Trump lacks -- and covets -- tools possessed by his adversaries in Beijing, who enjoy domination of the levers of policy.\n\nMr. Trump's strategy appears to be stoking nationalist anger in China, where the Communist Party government leans heavily on such sentiments for propaganda purposes. That could harden China's willingness to hold its position, as its leaders fear the consequences of gratifying an attack from the American leader.\n\nIt is not a recipe for expanded global trade, which grew by about 4 percent in 2017, then slowed to 2 percent last year and may contract this year.\n\n\"Once growth in trade volumes turns negative, it makes us all have to take a closer look at some sort of recession scenario,\" said Marie Owens Thomsen, global chief economist at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva. \"Things are looking more disconcerting for sure.

On May 13, The Times reported:\n\nThe United States and China intensified their trade dispute on Monday, as Beijing said it would increase tariffs on nearly $60 billion worth of American goods and the Trump administration detailed plans to tax nearly every sneaker, computer, dress and handbag that China exports to the United States.\n\nThe escalation thrust the world's two largest economies back into confrontation. While President Trump said on Monday that he would meet with China's president, Xi Jinping, next month in Japan, the stakes are only increasing as the president continues to taunt and threaten China, causing it to retaliate on American businesses.\n\nThe articles continues:\n\nChina's Finance Ministry announced Monday that it was raising tariffs on a wide range of American goods to 20 percent or 25 percent from 10 percent. The increase will affect the roughly $60 billion in American imports already being taxed as retaliation for Mr. Trump's previous round of tariffs, including beer, wine, swimsuits, shirts and liquefied natural gas exported to China.\n\nThe move came after Mr. Trump increased tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to as much as 25 percent on Friday, and threatened to move ahead with taxing the remainder of goods that the United States imports from China. The Office of the United States Trade Representative released a list on Monday of the roughly $300 billion worth of products that could face up to a 25 percent tariff and requested public comment, which will begin the formal process for enacting those duties. The list includes almost every consumer product imaginable, from coffee makers to sneakers to telescopic sights for rifles.\n\nWatch the four-minute video \"The Anatomy Of A Trade War\" from Newsy. As you watch, respond to the following questions:\n\n* What is a tariff?\n\n* Why might tariffs be considered a \"double-edged sword\"?\n\n* What is a trade war?\n\n* How do trade wars affect citizens?\n\nNow, read the article, \"U.S.-China Trade Standoff May Be Initial Skirmish in Broader Economic War,\" and answer the following questions:\n\n1. Why is the Trump administration trying to limit China's economic influence in the United States and abroad?\n\n2. How is the administration trying to restrain China's ambitions and methods of influence? Why is this a \"tricky task,\" according to the article?\n\n3. David Lampton, a China scholar at Stanford University, says the present trade war is a \"skirmish in an ongoing battle.\" What does he mean by that statement?\n\n4. Why is a trade deal unlikely to change China's behavior?\n\n5. How do many in China view the United States? How do they view China? How do these views contrast with the American perspective of the two countries?\n\n6. Why has China been resistant to the emerging terms of the trade deal?\n\n7. Since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, the prevailing view in the United States was that close economic engagement with China would produce an increasingly democratic country that would be closely tied to an international economic order founded mainly on Western liberal ideals. Did this prove to be true? Why or why not?\n\n8. How have Sino-American relations shifted in recent years? What are the future implications of this new relationship?\n\nFinally, tell us more about what you think:\n\nIs a trade war an effective way to restrain China's ambitions and methods of influence?\n\nIn \"Trump's Trade War Escalation Will Exact Economic Pain, Adviser Says,\" Jeanna Smialek, Jim Tankersley and Mark Landler write about how this conflict could affect everyday Americans:\n\nPresident Trump's chief economic adviser said on Sunday that American consumers would bear some pain from the escalating trade war with China, contradicting Mr. Trump's claim that his tariffs are a multibillion-dollar, mostly one-way payment by China to the American Treasury.\n\nThe comments from Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, came after the 11th round of trade negotiations broke off without a deal, prompting Mr. Trump to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products and begin a process to impose levies on nearly every product China exports to the United States.\n\n\"In fact, both sides will pay,\" Mr. Kudlow said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"Both sides will suffer on this.\"\n\nMr. Kudlow's acknowledgment of economic pain, while widely shared by economists, contradicted the president's view that trade wars are easy to win and that the burden falls disproportionately on America's trading partners. Mr. Trump again asserted on Monday that there was \"no reason\" that American consumers would pay the tariffs.\n\nBoth Mr. Kudlow and the president say that a protracted trade war will ultimately be in the United States' financial interest. Mr. Kudlow said that any pain would be worth the price if it forced China to treat American companies more fairly.\n\n\"You've got to do what you got to do,\" Mr. Kudlow said. \"We have had unfair trading practices all these years and so in my judgment, the economic consequences are so small that the possible improvement in trade and exports and open markets for the United States, this is worthwhile doing.\"\n\nTake a look at these lists of goods that the latest tariffs could make more expensive, including back packs, dog collars, strawberry jam and soy sauce. How many of these do you consume on a regular basis? To what extent might you and your family be affected by these tariffs?\n\nDo you agree with Mr. Trump and Mr. Kudlow that \"any pain would be worth the price if it forced China to treat American companies more fairly\"?

As the trade war with China has heated up, the president's itchy Twitter finger has been busy with a fuselage of false or misleading tweets. Whether the president knows these claims are untrue is unclear, but the overall effect is to create a distinct winner-takes-all narrative for his trade policy. Here's a quick tour through some of the major themes.\n\nThe U.S. is a loser\n\n\"We have lost 500 Billion Dollars a year, for many years, on Crazy Trade with China. NO MORE!\"\n\n-- Tweet, May 10, 2019\n\nThis is the Rosetta Stone of the president's trade philosophy -- that the United States has been ripped off by other countries for years. It's a view he expressed in full-page newspaper ads that ran in 1987, though then the main target was Japan.\n\nBut Trump consistently gets two things wrong here.\n\nFirst, he overstates the trade deficit with China. It was $378 billion in 2018, $336 billion in 2017 and $308 billion in 2016. But for Trump, it's always been $500 billion. Even if one just focuses on trade in goods, the deficit in 2018 was still not $500 billion, but $419 billion.\n\nGiven the rise in the trade deficit during his presidency, perhaps one day Trump will be right.\n\nSecond, countries do not \"lose\" money on trade deficits. A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. No matter what, people are receiving goods in exchange for their money.\n\nTrump often claims that other world leaders say that no previous president has made such an issue of the trade deficit, but that is because they are puzzled by his obsession with the number. The more relevant figure is whether a country's exports are growing. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative says U.S. goods exports are up 73 percent since 2008, and all U.S. exports are up 527 percent since 2001.\n\nChina hurts U.S. farmers\n\n\"Your all time favorite President got tired of waiting for China to help out and start buying from our FARMERS, the greatest anywhere in the World!\"\n\n-- Tweet, May 10\n\nHere Trump tries to take credit for solving a problem he created. His initial round of tariffs led China to stop purchasing soybeans and other agricultural products from the United States, resulting in steep losses for farmers. So Trump then scrambled to arrange a rescue package.\n\nAs of December, the government said, it cut nearly $9.6 billion in checks, including $7.3 billion to soybean farmers, $580 million to pork farmers and $554 million to cotton farmers. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also planned to spend $1.2 billion on purchases of surplus food and provide $200 million for trade promotion work by agriculture export groups. Now the president is talking about assembling another rescue package. (Ironically, one of the largest pork producers, Smithfield Foods, is owned by a Chinese conglomerate -- and under pressure, it gave up a purchase contract with Agriculture Department that had been awarded under the bailout program.)\n\nBut lost amid this rhetoric is that China was already a big purchaser of U.S. agricultural products. The trade representative office said that China was the fourth-largest agricultural export market in 2018, worth $9.3 billion. But China had been the largest export market for U.S. farmers in 2017, with $24 billion in exports, before Trump imposed tariffs.\n\nThrough December, The Fact Checker estimated that Trump's tariffs had raised $12 billion, of which $8 billion stemmed from tariffs on Chinese products. But recall that he had authorized $12 billion in payments to help farmers, making it a net loser at the time.\n\nWe win, China loses\n\n\"If we bought 15 Billion Dollars of Agriculture from our Farmers, far more than China buys now, we would have more than 85 Billion Dollars left over for new Infrastructure, Healthcare, or anything else. China would greatly slow down, and we would automatically speed up!\"\n\n-- Tweet, May 10\n\nTrump falsely claims the tariffs would raise $100 billion from China. But China does not pay these tariffs. The tariffs -- essentially a tax -- are generally paid by importers, such as U.S. companies, who in turn pass on most or all of the costs to consumers or producers who may use Chinese materials in their products. (Chinese producers will pay part of the tax if there are fewer goods sold to the United States.)\n\nIn today's interconnected world, if the Chinese economy \"greatly\" slows down, the U.S. economy would almost certainly suffer.\n\n\"China will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates, as always, in order to make up for the business they are, and will be, losing. If the Federal Reserve ever did a 'match,' it would be game over, we win! In any event, China wants a deal!\"\n\n-- Tweet, May 14\n\nTrump's jawboning of the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates is reportedly one of the reasons the Chinese started to drive a harder bargain; they assumed the U.S. economy was more fragile than they realized. Trump's tariffs almost certainly will lower economic growth and raise inflation, which might put pressure on the Fed to act. But that would not be a \"win\" for the United States.\n\n\"Many companies are leaving China so that they will be more competitive for USA buyers.\"\n\n-- Tweet, May 14\n\nThere is no evidence that this is the case. Few experts thought the two countries would go to the brink like this, and a survey of member companies by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that only 6 percent would consider relocating their business because of tariffs.\n\nTariffs work\n\n\"There is no reason for the U.S. Consumer to pay the Tariffs, which take effect on China today. This has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the U.S., 21 points by China because China subsidizes product to such a large degree.\"\n\n-- Tweet, May 13\n\nTrump is quoting from a study by European economists that predicted that a 25-percentage-point increase in tariffs raises U.S. consumer prices on all affected Chinese products by only 4.5 percent on average, while the producer price of Chinese firms declines by 20.5 percent. The study was released in November, using previously released studies from the 1990s, not actual data on prices. But a paper published March 2, by three prominent U.S. economists, found exactly the opposite had happened when actual trade data was studied.\n\n\"Overall, using standard economic methods, we find that the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018,\" the economists reported. \"We find that the U.S. tariffs were almost completely passed through into U.S. domestic prices, so that the entire incidence of the tariffs fell on domestic consumers and importers up to now, with no impact so far on the prices received by foreign exporters. We also find that U.S. producers responded to reduced import competition by raising their prices.\"\n\nAnother paper, published March 3, found similar results, with the impact heaviest in Republican counties. \"We estimate that the U.S. economy has lost $68.8 billion due to higher import prices,\" the economists concluded.\n\n\"The unexpectedly good first quarter 3.2% GDP was greatly helped by Tariffs from China. Some people just don't get it!\"\n\n-- Tweet, May 13\n\nNope. Tariffs reduce economic growth, as even Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow acknowledged in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday\" the day before this tweet. He said it would reduce growth by \"two-tenths of 1 percent\" of the gross domestic product, which translates to $40 billion. Other estimates are bigger -- the Trade Partnership has a figure twice as high -- which is why the Fed might have to reduce interest rates if the trade war continues.\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/If_V83BGPW7iHizM4VW7EwoTWhk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7MUMTMTWRII6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4789558", "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 295601400}, {"uri": "1136185343", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-15", "time": "00:15:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-15T00:15:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/05/14/five-ways-trade-war-will-hurt-american-shoppers/", "title": "Five ways the trade war will hurt American shoppers", "body": "Prices on many goods imported from China, including vacuum cleaners, are likely to rise after President Trump enacted new tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) By Abha Bhattarai Abha Bhattarai Reporter covering the retail industry May 14 at 4:27 PM\n\nThe trade war with China is heading straight for Americans' wallets.\n\nShoppers can expect to soon see higher prices on everyday items like shampoo, suitcases and salmon, as the latest round of tariffs trickles down to consumers. American businesses have so far shouldered much of the burden of rising costs, but owners say they now have little choice but to pass on the 25 percent tariff to shoppers.\n\n\"Ultimately consumers are going to be very surprised,\" said Peter J. Bragdon, chief administrative officer for Columbia Sportswear Co. \"They've been told they won't see any rise in prices, and that's just not true.\"\n\nIn all, American families will pay an extra $767 a year on everyday items like suitcases, cribs and clothing following Friday's tariffs, according to a report by the Trade Partnership. If Trump makes good on his threat to tax all remaining Chinese imports, that figure could go up to about $2,389 a year for the average household. It could also lead to 2.2 million job losses and a 1 percent dip in GDP, the report said.\n\nHere are five areas where Americans will soon be paying more.\n\n1. Furniture\n\nMillions of dollars worth of cribs make their way from China to the United States every week, and almost all of them are now subject to a 25 percent tariff, according to Joseph Shamie, president of Delta Children, which sells its cribs just about everywhere, from Walmart to Restoration Hardware.\n\n\"Cribs are a necessity, and this is going to be a significant price increase for parents,\" Shamie said. \"We've absorbed much of the tariffs until now, but we obviously cannot continue to do that at 25 percent.\"\n\nOther types of furniture, including beds, dining chairs and bookcases, are also becoming more expensive. At Wyckes Furniture Outlet in San Diego, manager Andre Phillips says prices have inched up since September, when the first round of tariffs took hold.\n\n[This could be catastrophic': Small businesses say new tariffs will make it even harder to compete]\n\n2. Household goods including toilet paper\n\nEveryday essentials, including toilet paper, tissues and deodorant, are likely to go up in price, as the latest tariffs make their way down to American consumers. The Trump administration's 194-page list of affected products also includes makeup, bath salts and petroleum jelly (though sunscreen is exempt).\n\n\"This round of tariffs could impact a significant number of common consumer items that are not easily replaceable,\" Walmart wrote in a letter to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative last year. \"The immediate impact will be to raise prices on consumers and tax American business and manufacturers. \"\n\nThe impact on prices is likely to be sudden, retailers said, particularly for low-cost items with thin profit margins.\n\n\"The categories that are covered includes thousands of products Americans buy every day, from phone chargers and cling wrap to toilet paper, toothbrushes and dog leashes,\" said Hun Quach, vice president of international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, an industry lobbying group. \"There is little to nothing retailers can do to mitigate this 25 percent increase.\"\n\n[White House weighs new farmer bailout as fight with China heats up]\n\n3. Hats, handbags and fleece vests -- even for dogs\n\nTake note, Patagonia bros: Fleece vests and other types of knitwear are now subject to a 25 percent tariff, as are hats, backpacks and certain leather clothes.\n\nAt PetRageous Designs, a Massachusetts-based maker of animal accessories, executives say dog clothing like sweaters and rain coats have been among the hardest hit. Beginning this year, customers can expect to pay about 15 to 20 percent more on pajamas and outerwear for Fido.\n\n\"We just notified customers that we will be unable to absorb this combination of tariffs,\" Charlie George, who handles the company's finances. \"In dollars and cents, that means a $10 dog sweater today is going to end up selling for $12.\"\n\n4. Household appliances and electric devices\n\nIt's no secret that washing machines have become more expensive in recent months -- Americans spent an extra $1.5 billion annually on washers and dryers since Trump's 2018 tariffs took hold, according to a recent study.\n\nBut now manufacturers say prices are also likely to rise on other household appliances, including refrigerators, air conditioners and wine chillers.\n\n[Trump's washing-machine tariffs cost U.S. consumers $815,000 for every job created]\n\n\"This latest round of tariffs pulls consumers' homes into the middle of an international trade dispute,\" Jennifer Cleary, vice president of regulatory affairs for the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, said in September.\n\nAlso on the list are common parts for a range of other electronic items, including stoves, vacuum cleaners and even bicycles.\n\n\"A 25 percent bump at the wholesale level could end up being a 40 or 50 percent increase by the time something gets to the sales floor,\" said Adam Rossi, owner of Adam Solar Rides, which sells electric bicycles, skateboards and hoverboards in Pittsburgh.\n\n5. Health care\n\nAlthough pharmaceuticals and medical devices are exempt from the newest tariffs, consumers may still face rising health-care costs as hospitals and clinics pay more for everyday necessities, according to the American Hospital Association.\n\n\"Tariffs will increase the cost of providing health care to all Americans, hitting vulnerable communities, such as rural communities that can least afford higher costs, especially hard,\" Thomas P. Nickels, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, wrote in a letter to the Trump administration in November.\n\nRecent tariffs, he said, will cost hospitals and clinics at least $160 million a year. They will also pay more on steel and other construction items, and appliances including commercial washing machines.\n\n'Are these tariffs going to happen?' U.S. retailers fearful as they try to plan for holidays.\n\nConsumers around the world are spending less on almost everything.

The confrontation is also fueled by Trump's willingness to flout the norms of presidential behavior, including his suggestion on Tuesday that the Federal Reserve should assist his trade efforts by lowering interest rates.\n\n\"I don't see him crying uncle anytime soon,\" said Stephen Moore, a conservative economist who withdrew from consideration as a Trump Federal Reserve Board nominee amid an uproar. \"It's a high-risk strategy, but it's not in his personality to back down. This goes back to what he said that first time he came down the escalator at Trump Tower.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters Tuesday before boarding Marine One en route to Louisiana, Trump insisted that he is in a \"very, very strong position\" and called the stalled negotiations \"a little squabble.\"\n\nTrump cast the strength of the U.S. economy as leverage, saying, \"We have all the advantage.\" And he threatened to impose $100 billion in additional tariffs, saying, \"We're looking at it very strongly.\"\n\nBut as Trump expresses confidence, there have been tensions inside the White House, with some advisers uneasy with Trump's strident nationalism and firm belief in tariffs as economic weapons. The disagreements reflect broader distress within Republican circles about the president's sharp rhetoric and refusal to budge.\n\n\"I don't like directionally where it's going,\" said former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, a prominent investor. \"The economy is still very strong. It's not clear to me it will fully derail the economic story. But it could put a dent in the stock and bond market.\"\n\n\"Tariffs are blunt instruments. They can inflict on competitors and be a source of leverage for negotiations,\" said former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who at times engaged in heated discussions with Trump on trade. \"They can also have significant consequences for global supply chains and domestic producers and consumers, and any decision on tariffs should include careful consideration of all these consequences.\"\n\nTrump has worked to contain his current advisers as the negotiations have unfolded and present a united front to the Chinese, who he believes are looking for weakness, according to multiple officials, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private discussions. With Scaramucci, Porter and others who are alarmed now gone from the White House, Trump has found it easier to navigate his own administration and govern by his own instincts.\n\nTrump was irritated on Sunday after National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow acknowledged on \"Fox News Sunday\" that American consumers end up paying for the administration's tariffs on Chinese imports, contradicting Trump's claim that the Chinese foot the bill, officials said.\n\n\"Trump called Larry, and they had it out,\" according to one White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly. Two other officials, however, described the conversation as cordial and said Trump and Kudlow went back and forth on trade, with Trump telling Kudlow several times to \"not worry about it.\"\n\nRepublicans close to the president have said they've come to accept the president's hard line, even if they do not share it.\n\n\"The president believes tariffs are good economic policy. They are a tool to bring about trade,\" said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump confidant. \"Trump has been consistent on trade for 30 years.\"\n\nGraham said Trump often speaks about China in sweeping ways that underscore his unwillingness to flinch. Aides to the president say he comments about how many goods are made at low cost in China and how he believes China does not pay their workers or follow international laws. These people say he also bragged to aides about how much he has damaged the Chinese economy.\n\nAt a \"Cocktails and Conversation\" gathering of Republicans at the luxe 21 Club restaurant in New York City on Monday night, former Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn said he felt that the president might want to keep the debate over trade alive for the 2020 election because he believed it is a winning campaign issue, according to one attendee who was not authorized to discuss the meeting publicly.\n\nCohn, who has long been critical of tariffs, also worried aloud that the clash could do lasting damage to the nation's farming industries and said the Trump administration's effort to offset the effect of the trade war on U.S. farmers by supplying subsidies for them is not a sufficient approach if markets are lost, two attendees said. Cohn compared Trump's strategy to treating cancer with a Band-Aid, they said.\n\nStill, Cohn said, Trump could win a second term on the strength of the U.S. economy. He added that the president could run on a \"3-3-3\" platform, meaning about 3 percent for unemployment, GDP growth and wage growth, two attendees said.\n\nThe event, which included wealthy political donors and other GOP power brokers, was organized by a firm that employs former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who also spoke there, according to three people familiar with the gathering.\n\nWhen Cohn was in the administration, he and Trump would have loud, profane fights over tariffs, and Trump would sometimes tell him to stop arguing because Cohn wasn't going to change the president's mind, according to former aides.\n\nTrump would acknowledge in private conversations that economists broadly say tariffs cause American consumers to pay higher prices, but he would add that \"you can find an economist to say anything,\" in the words of one former aide who discussed the issue with him.\n\nDozens of U.S. companies have complained that Trump's earlier steel and aluminum tariffs drove up their costs and hurt more U.S. workers than they helped. But Trump does not see it that way and suspects companies are trying to blame him for troubles that began before he implemented tariffs, according to people familiar with the internal debate.\n\n\"For right now, it's what is going to get him reelected, because we have unemployment rates low and wages increasing,\" said Tom Bossert, a former Trump administration homeland security adviser. \"Trump sees it as standing up for the American worker.\"\n\nSome Democrats wonder if Trump's strategy is effective or more of an extemporaneous exercise without any clear end.\n\n\"China is a target that has to be confronted,\" said Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats. \"The question is whether this shock-and-awe strategy is a strategy at all. Will stronger tariffs lead to results? I'm not sure.\"\n\nTrump's influential allies in the conservative media, such as Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, have been enthusiastically encouraging the president's headstrong tactics and disparaging his business-friendly critics.\n\nDobbs, speaking on Monday night's broadcast with longtime Trump political adviser Corey Lewandowski, railed against Trump's opponents on trade as the \"chamber of horrors\" -- a reference to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- and said he should ignore \"all the Wall Street firms.\"\n\nStephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist who once advised Trump on trade, said in an interview Tuesday that Trump's outlook on trade has not changed since they first met in 2010 at Trump Tower, and argued that it will be hard for any adviser to convince him to change.\n\n\"Back then, he was watching Dobbs, reading the New York Times, following everything on China,\" Bannon said. \"It's at the core of who he is.\"\n\nBut there is a widening gap between Trump and congressional Republicans, who on Tuesday expressed unhappiness with the president's refusal to measurably soften his position. A number of GOP senators have called to express displeasure in recent days, people familiar with the calls say, but Trump remains determined.\n\n\"The fact is it's Americans who are paying the price of these tariffs,\" Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) told reporters on Tuesday, citing economic data showing the levies have not had the intended effect of closing the trade gap with China or measurably hurting Chinese exports.\n\nAsked if Trump understands this view, Toomey said, \"I assume the president understands how this works. But you'd have to ask him why he comes to the conclusions he comes to.\" When pressed for further explanation, he declined and said he would \"leave it at that.\"\n\nVice President Pence has quietly sought to allay senators concerns over tariffs but has been unable to offer any meaningful concessions or promises, Senate GOP aides said this week. During a lunch with Republicans last week, Pence told senators he heard them when they berated the administration's tariffs, but he then asked them to stand with the president, without saying much else.\n\nErica Werner and Damian Paletta contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aRC29mWaiF6fd2gMTXqy5wkXdXQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Z3XGRTDWMUI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4783551", "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 295573740}, {"uri": "1136160453", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-14", "time": "23:18:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-14T23:18:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4431372582912445, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/theres-a-revealing-puzzle-in-the-china-tariffs/2019/05/14/75df04de-7675-11e9-b3f5-5673edf2d127_story.html", "title": "Opinion | There's a revealing puzzle in the China tariffs", "body": "By Lawrence H. Summers Lawrence H. Summers May 14 at 6:56 PM\n\nOn Monday, China announced new tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. exports, and the United States threatened new tariffs on up to $300 billion of Chinese goods. These actions were cited as the principle reason for a decline of more than 600 points in the Dow Jones industrial average, or about 2.4 percent in broader measures of the stock market. With the total value of U.S. stocks around $30 trillion, this decline represents more than $700 billion in lost wealth.\n\nThis was not an isolated event. Again and again in the past year, markets have gyrated in response to the state of trade negotiations between the United States and China.\n\nThe market sensitivity to threats and counter-threats in the trade war is quite remarkable. Monday's announcement by the Chinese, for example, would be expected to raise China's tariffs by about $10 billion. Much of this will show up as higher prices for Chinese importers, and some of it will be avoided by diverting exports of goods such as liquid natural gas to other markets, so the impact on U.S. corporate profits will be far less than $10 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. tariffs are likely to raise corporate profits as higher import costs push some business to domestic producers.\n\nThere is the further consideration that reasonable market participants should not have entirely discounted the possibility of tariff increases Monday and that there surely remains some chance a trade deal will be reached. So, in fact, the market should not even have moved in full proportion to the change in corporate profitability associated with new tariffs.\n\nThere is a revealing puzzle here. Events whose direct impact on corporate profits is a few billion dollars seem to be driving market fluctuations that change the total value of corporations by hundreds of billions of dollars. To be sure, there would be many ways of refining my calculation of the profit impact to recognize various feedbacks, and certainly the imposition of tariffs increases uncertainty, which in general depresses markets. But with any plausible calculation of the direct impact of tariff changes on profitability or uncertainty about profitability, it is not possible to justify the kinds of changes in market value we observed Monday or on many other days when there was news about the status of the U.S.-China trade negotiations.\n\nPart of the answer to the puzzle, I suspect, lies in markets' tendency to sometimes overreact to news, especially in areas where they do not have long experience. This idea is supported by the tendency illustrated by the market's Tuesday rally, which took place without any particularly encouraging U.S.-China developments.\n\nA larger part of the answer probably lies in the idea that the current trade conflict is a possible prelude to a far larger conflict between the two nations with the largest economies and greatest power for as far as can be foreseen. When it appears less likely that a conflict over well-defined and ultimately not-that-difficult commercial issues can be resolved, rational observers conclude that it is also less likely the United States and China can manage issues ranging from 5G wireless technology to North Korea, from the future of Taiwan to global climate change, and from the management of globalization to the security architecture of the Pacific region.\n\nA world where relations between the United States and China are largely conflictual could involve a breakdown of global supply chains, a splinternet (as separate, noninteroperable internets compete around the world), greatly increased defense expenditures and conceivably even military conflict. All of this would be catastrophic for living standards and would also have huge adverse effects on the value of global companies.\n\nIt is, I suspect, the greater risk of catastrophic medium-run outcomes, rather than the proximate impact of trade conflicts, that is driving the outsize market reactions to trade negotiation news.\n\nThis carries with it an important lesson for both sides: It is risky to turn the pursuit of even vital national objectives into an existential crusade. Rather, even when nations have objectives that are in conflict, it is important to seek compromise, to avoid inflammatory rhetoric and to confine rather than enlarge the areas where demands are being made. Establishing credibility that promises will be kept and surprises will be avoided is as or more important with adversaries as with friends.\n\nAs the Trump administration carries on the trade negotiations, and as the presidential campaign heats up, Americans will do well to remember that there is no greater threat to the success of our national enterprise over the next quarter-century than mismanagement of the relationship with China. It is not just possible but essential to be strong and resolute without being imprudent and provocative.\n\nThe Post's View: Trump's biggest mistake in the trade war with China\n\nJennifer Rubin: Trump can't admit he enacted a new tax\n\nMarc A.

And for a time, this unpredictable approach served him reasonably well. Leaders from China, North Korea and Iran found themselves off balance, and they sometimes made what looked like concessions.\n\nTrump's problem is that, after two years, foreign nations seem to have figured him out. Rather than crafting quick deals that Trump could tout as wins, these adversaries have played a waiting game. They appear to sense in Trump an impatience and hunger for the spotlight that undermine his ability to negotiate.\n\nTrump in recent weeks has moved toward confrontations with China, North Korea and Iran. In each case, the White House has maximum goals without a clearly discernible strategy for achieving them. Trump's statements oscillate between hard-line rhetoric and invitations to personal diplomacy. Sometimes he appears to contradict positions that his advisers have taken. Once, this back-and-forth might have produced leverage for Trump; now, it often just yields confusion.\n\nLooking at the various global showdowns, you can see a common theme -- of adversaries that appear more willing to take risks in resisting Trump's demands. Trump's response is often to double down. This dynamic carries a danger of miscalculation.\n\nIn the trade war with China, Trump embraced the perennial U.S. desire for a \"level playing field.\" But he pursued it with a blunderbuss, through escalating tariffs. Trump seemed convinced that China would eventually make concessions that he could claim as a victory. Such a deal seemed imminent this month, and Trump said Monday that it was 95 percent done when Chinese leaders balked.\n\nU.S. experts offer two theories about why China resisted a settlement. One is that Trump's negotiators wouldn't promise to remove promptly all tariffs imposed on $250 billion in Chinese products, and the Chinese didn't trust an erratic American president to eliminate them eventually. Another theory is that Trump's bravado had convinced the Chinese that he was actually in a weak position and could be pushed.\n\nEither way, Trump's negotiating style seemed to be part of the problem. Trump and President Xi Jinping will meet at next month's Group of 20 summit, perhaps for a reset.\n\nThe nuclear negotiations with North Korea have been even more puzzling. Trump went for a showy but vague denuclearization statement in his first summit with Kim Jong Un in Singapore. His State Department advisers then worked to prepare a road map for step-by-step negotiations to achieve that goal; but Trump, impatient with slow progress, pushed for another showy maximal agreement at the Hanoi summit in February.\n\nWhen that summit collapsed, Trump tried flattering Kim and publicly endorsed the incremental approach. Kim, perhaps sensing uncertainty in Trump's changing positions, turned up the pressure by resuming missile tests this month. The United States matched Pyongyang's show of strength by seizing a North Korean ship allegedly carrying forbidden cargo.\n\nThe bottom line is that with North Korea, as with China, Trump's disruptive style has had diminishing returns.\n\nWhich brings us to the most dangerous of the confrontations, the test of strength with Iran. As Trump tightened the vise of sanctions on the Iranian economy, Tehran seems to have opted for counter-disruption. Israel and other Middle East allies have warned of Iranian preparations for sabotage or military action; the United States responded with an aircraft carrier group and B-52 bombers.\n\nWhen several tankers were damaged off the United Arab Emirates this week, perhaps by an Iranian mine, the New York Times reported that the administration had updated plans to send as many as 120,000 U.S. troops to the region if necessary. But as always with Trump, there have been mixed signals: The White House is exploring whether to refer the tanker incident to the United Nations, and Trump has said he's waiting for a call from Iranian leaders.\n\nTrump's approach as he strides toward the brink in negotiations often seems that of a gambler. He's operating on instinct and luck, rather than a careful strategy. He's not counting cards or precisely calculating the odds. He's winging it, hoping he can bluff the other players. He plays hunches; he blusters his adversaries and then flatters them; he focuses on the optics of looking strong, as opposed to the fundamentals.\n\nPhilosopher Isaiah Berlin famously divided people into hedgehogs, who know one big thing, and foxes, who know many little things. Trump may snort like a hedgehog, but his shifting dealmaking approach may be closer to a fox -- albeit an uncertain one -- and the other animals in the forest seem to have figured that out.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\nThe Post's View: Trump's biggest mistake in the trade war with China\n\nMarc A.

But they increasingly look like a more permanent tool to shelter American industry, block imports and banish an undesirable trade deficit.\n\nMore than two years into the Trump administration, the United States has emerged as a nation with the highest tariff rate among developed countries, outranking Canada, Germany and France, as well as China, Russia and Turkey.\n\nOn Tuesday, the president continued to tout his trade war with China, saying that the 25 percent tariffs he imposed on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods would benefit the United States, and that he was looking \"very strongly\" at imposing additional levies on nearly every Chinese import.\n\n\"I think it's going to turn out extremely well. We're in a very strong position,\" Mr. Trump said in remarks from the White House lawn. \"Our economy is fantastic; theirs is not so good. We've gone up trillions and trillions of dollars since the election; they've gone way down since my election.\"\n\nHe called the trade dispute \"a little squabble\" and suggested he was in no rush to end his fight, though he held out the possibility an agreement could be reached, saying: \"They want to make a deal. It could absolutely happen.\" Stock markets rebounded on Tuesday, after plunging on Monday as China and the United States resumed their tariff war.\n\nAdditional tariffs could be on the way. Mr. Trump faces a Friday deadline to determine whether the United States will proceed with his threat to impose global auto tariffs, a move that has been criticized by car companies and foreign policymakers. And despite complaints by Republican lawmakers and American companies, Mr. Trump's global metal tariffs remain in place on Canada, Mexico, Europe and other allies.\n\nThe trade barriers are putting the United States, previously a steadfast advocate of global free trade, in an unfamiliar position. The country now has the highest overall trade-weighted tariff rate at 4.2 percent, higher than any of the Group of 7 industrialized nations, according to Torsten Slok, the chief economist of Deutsche Bank Securities. That is now more than twice as high as the rate for Canada, Britain, Italy, Germany and France, and higher than most emerging markets, including Russia, Turkey and even China, Mr. Slok said.\n\n[A trade war with China could be long and painful.]\n\nThe shift is having consequences for an American economy that is dependent on global trade, including multinational companies like Boeing, General Motors, Apple, Caterpillar and other businesses that source components from abroad and want access to growing markets overseas.\n\nWhile trade accounts for a smaller percentage of the American economy than in most other countries -- just 27 percent in 2017, compared with 38 percent for China and 87 percent for Germany, according to World Bank data -- it is still a critical driver of jobs and economic growth.\n\nFor now, the American economy remains strong, with rising wages and the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. But with less trade, American jobs up and down the value chain that are seemingly unrelated to importing and exporting goods could suffer, including research and development, retail and marketing products.\n\nDouglas Irwin, a trade historian at Dartmouth College, said Mr. Trump's tariff battle with China was bringing about \"a new status quo for the world economy.\"\n\n\"If we do have this consensus that we want to isolate ourselves from China, that's a big historic shift in U.S. trade policy,\" Mr. Irwin said. \"We've moved away from tariffs as a bargaining chip to get a better deal to tariffs as a means to an end to decoupling the economies.\"\n\nMr. Trump and his economic advisers say the administration's trade policy is aiding the American economy, companies and consumers. And despite the tough approach, the administration continues to insist its goal is to strike trade agreements that give American businesses better trade terms overseas.\n\nAt a briefing last week, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, praised the president's trade policies for helping economic growth thus far and said the administration supports \"free and fair reciprocal trade.\"\n\nBut if the goal really is freer trade, the administration has never been further from achieving that goal than it is today, said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\"They're heading in the opposite direction,\" Mr. Bown said.\n\nBeyond a minor update to the United States agreement with South Korea, no other free trade deals have been finalized. Mr. Trump's revisions to the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico still await passage in Congress, while trade talks with the European Union and Japan have been troubled from the start, with governments squabbling over the scope of the agreement.\n\nThe easier explanation, said Michael Strain, the director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, is to take the president at his word that he is a protectionist.\n\n\"Those are the words they're using, and those are the actions they're taking,\" he said.\n\nIn remarks this week, Mr. Trump said companies that did not want to pay the tariffs could shift production out of China and into the United States or another country that has not been hit with tariffs. While there are signs that this shift is happening, it seems to benefiting countries like Mexico and Vietnam rather than the United States.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the president's actions will precipitate a broader shift away from global integration that might echo around the world and outlast the Trump administration.\n\nMr. Trump came into office fiercely critical of the failure of past administrations and global bodies like the World Trade Organization for failing to police China's unfair trade practices. He withdrew the United States from multilateral efforts like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multicountry trade deal negotiated by President Barack Obama, and the Paris climate accord.\n\nThat shift has created an opening for other countries to step forward as global leaders, including Europe, Japan and China, despite its position as one of the world's most controversial economic actors. On Tuesday, China submitted its proposals for overhauling the World Trade Organization, including broadening the privileges of developed countries, a status that China claims for itself.\n\nAdvocates of free trade fear that governments in India, China, South Africa and elsewhere might find Mr. Trump's model of protectionism appealing and erect even higher barriers to foreign companies.\n\nWhile the United States and China could still strike a trade deal that would roll back many of their tariffs, that likelihood has appeared to diminish in recent weeks.\n\nProgress toward a deal came to a sudden halt this month when China backtracked on certain commitments and Mr. Trump threatened to move ahead with higher tariffs.\n\n\"We had a deal that was very close, and then they broke it,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\nThe two sides continue to disagree over whether the deal's provisions must be enshrined in China's laws. But they are also arguing over Mr. Trump's tariffs, which were intended to prod the Chinese to agree to more favorable trade terms for the United States. China insists those tariffs must come off once a deal is reached, but the Trump administration wants some to remain in place, to ensure China abides by its commitments.\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday on CNBC, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, supported the administration's tactics.\n\n\"Ideally, you wouldn't have tariffs,\" he said. But the United States already faces \"all kinds of impediments\" to gaining access to the Chinese marketplace, including tariffs, subsidization of industries and theft of intellectual property.\n\n\"We already have a series of hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese penalties against the United States which are threatening our long-term viability,\" Mr. Rubio said.\n\nCanada and Mexico have repeatedly pressed the administration to lift its tariffs on steel and aluminum now that negotiations over the Nafta revision are done. The three countries signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in November, but the pact awaits passage in all three legislatures.\n\nThe Trump administration still views the tariffs as a source of leverage in case it needs to demand final changes to the deal from Canada and Mexico. But Canadian and Mexican officials -- as well as many in Congress -- say the levies are actually an impediment because all three legislatures will refuse to finalize the deal while they are in place.\n\nA similar standoff could soon unfold with the European Union, which Mr. Trump has accused of being a \"brutal trading partner\" and being \"tougher than China.\"\n\nThe president, who wants Europe to open its markets to American farmers and companies, has already imposed tariffs on European metals and is threatening to levy a 25 percent tax on imports of European cars and car parts if the bloc does not give the United States better trade terms.\n\nEurope has absorbed Mr. Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs without too much damage. But car tariffs would strike the most important industry in Germany, which has the Continent's biggest economy. European officials would regard car tariffs as a breach of a truce they worked out last year with Mr. Trump, and they have said they would refuse to negotiate as long as car tariffs were in place.\n\nCecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, repeated on Monday that the European Union had prepared a list of American products worth $22.5 billion -- including ketchup, suitcases and tractors -- that would face immediate retaliatory tariffs.\n\n\"We're prepared for the worst,\" Ms. Malmstrom said in an interview with the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper in Germany.\n\nEuropean officials still hold out hope that Mr. Trump will see them as allies and not geopolitical rivals like the Chinese. And he could ultimately delay the decision and extend the Friday deadline for countries that are in trade talks with the United States.\n\nBut the president shows no signs of backing away from his stance that tariffs have helped the United States.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that tariffs had rebuilt America's steel industry and were encouraging companies to leave China, making it \"more competitive\" for buyers in the United States.\n\n\"China buys MUCH less from us than we buy from them, by almost 500 Billion Dollars, so we are in a fantastic position,\" Mr. Trump tweeted. \"Make your product at home in the USA and there is no Tariff.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/14/world/14dc-trade-print/merlin_154532736_ccf8fe3f-b205-4db0-b09a-d4bb0e5856f0-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4783551", "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 295563480}, {"uri": "1136075001", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-14", "time": "20:34:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-14T20:34:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/politics/republicans-balk-at-more-tariffs-as-trump-mulls-more-farm-aid.html", "title": "Republicans Balk at More Tariffs as Trump Mulls More Farm Aid", "body": "WASHINGTON -- At a White House meeting earlier this month, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the powerful Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, pressed President Trump to repeal the metal tariffs he imposed on Canada and Mexico, which he argued were hurting the struggling farmers the president had vowed to protect.\n\nHours later, Mr. Trump made clear that the message was not received.\n\n\"Tariffs are working,\" the president said on Twitter, attributing an investment announced by U.S. Steel to the steel and aluminum tariffs Mr. Trump put into effect last year.\n\nMr. Trump sold his trade disputes with China, Canada, Mexico and Europe as an effort to lower trade barriers. But the rewritten North American Free Trade Agreement has stalled in Congress, Europe is preparing retaliation in the event that Mr. Trump unleashes automobile tariffs this week and negotiations with China have broken down, devolving into an all-out trade war.\n\nThe collateral damage has been America's farmers, and Mr. Grassley, a generally loyal ally to the president, has emerged as his chief critic on trade.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Grassley, an Iowa farmer himself, warned that Mr. Trump could face political consequences if the pain that farmers are feeling continues to fester.\n\n\"It's going to have some impact on elections, of course,\" Mr. Grassley said. \"So far, I haven't seen farmers abandoning Trump, but it's going to have some impact.\"\n\nMr. Trump last week raised tariff rates on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent and threatened to impose tariffs on another $300 billion of Chinese goods if negotiations continue to falter. On Monday, China hit back with tariffs as high as 25 percent on $60 billion of American goods, effective June 1.\n\nMr. Trump, cognizant of China's penchant for hitting where it hurts, said he expected Beijing to once again retaliate against America's farmers by slowing or stopping purchases of agricultural products, like soybeans and farm equipment.\n\nThe administration, which provided $12 billion in aid to farmers last year to mitigate the effects of the trade war, is developing plans for another bailout this year. Mr. Trump suggested this week that he will provide another $15 billion in financial support to farmers, potentially funded through the tariffs he is imposing on Chinese imports.\n\n\"Our great Patriot Farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now,\" Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nThe predicament facing farmers as a result of the trade war is grim.\n\nPrices of soybeans, pork and cotton all slumped this week after China retaliated against the United States. JP Morgan on Tuesday downgraded the stock of Deere, the farm equipment manufacturer, warning that the agriculture sector is \"rapidly deteriorating\" and that additional farm aid would likely do little to buttress the fortunes of farmers.\n\nWhile Mr. Grassley supports the need to confront China, he made clear that the tariffs must go.\n\n\"I'm no fan of tariffs,\" Mr. Grassley said. \"I'm disappointed by the news of additional tariffs out of Beijing and here in Washington. Both countries are going to be hurt.\"\n\nGovernment subsidies are generally anathema to conservative economic orthodoxy. As Republicans grapple with Mr. Trump's trade policy, some Republicans have quietly come to accept them, while others insist that they only make matters worse.\n\nSenator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, told reporters on Tuesday that the proposed bailout sounds \"inadequate\" to deal with the problem, adding that \"it won't supply the benefit in terms of the demand and market share that a trade deal would.\"\n\nAmong the most vocal critics of Mr. Trump's plans to subsidize farmers is Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania. On Tuesday he sharply criticized the White House's strategy with China, arguing that \"Americans were paying the price\" of Mr. Trump's recent moves.\n\nMr. Toomey, who represents a state whose agricultural sector mainly relies on domestic consumption, called Mr. Trump's second round of payouts \"a handout\" that would saddle taxpayers with debt.\n\n\"The term is meant to be pejorative because it's a very bad policy,\" he said. \"I mean, think about what we're doing -- we're inviting this retaliation that denies our farmers, the most productive farmers on the planet, the opportunity to sell their products overseas and then we say, 'Don't worry, we'll have taxpayers send you some checks and make it O.K.' \"\n\nFarmers say that they would prefer free trade over government subsidies. But with exports of products such as wheat and soybeans to China drying up, they are willing to take whatever help they can get.\n\n\"It's going to be needed,\" said John Heisdorffer, a soybean producer from Keota, Iowa, and chairman of the American Soybean Association. \"I hear from so many farmers now, how they're struggling.\"\n\nMr. Heisdorffer said that many farmers are feeling emotionally drained by the ups and downs of the trade negotiations with China and that he hopes Mr. Trump can find a way to roll back all the tariffs.\n\n\"At this point, I still hear a lot of support for the president,\" he said. \"We support what he's doing, but we felt all the time that there was a different way than tariffs to have done it.\"\n\nBut Mr. Trump thus far has shown little interest in changing course. Before boarding Marine One on Tuesday, the president described the economic battle with China as a \"little squabble\" and said that the United States would win in the end.\n\nFor lawmakers such as Mr. Grassley, who espouse the virtues of free trade, the stubbornness of the squabble has amounted to growing frustration. The senator from Iowa said this week that he intended to begin sending his concerns to Mr. Trump in writing.\n\n\"I'm not sure if you talk to him face to face he hears everything you say,\" Mr. Grassley said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alan_rappeport@nytimes.com", "name": "Alan Rappeport", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/14/business/14DC-FARMTRADE-01/14DC-FARMTRADE-01-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4785184", "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 295562040}, {"uri": "1136043762", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-14", "time": "19:43:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-14T19:43:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6196078658103943, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/14/trump-didnt-start-this-trade-war-china-did/", "title": "Opinion | Trump didn't start this trade war, China did", "body": "Container ships are berthed in Hong Kong on Tuesday. (Jerome Favre/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock) By Marc A. Thiessen Marc A. Thiessen Columnist focusing on foreign and domestic policy Columnist May 14 at 2:56 PM\n\nBefore President Trump announced that he was imposing 25 percent tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of Chinese goods, he got encouragement from an unlikely source: Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). The Senate Democratic leader, who has little good to say about Trump most days, tweeted, \"Hang tough on China, @realDonaldTrump. Don't back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.\"\n\nThat should have been a wake-up call for Beijing. When Chuck Schumer is tweeting support for Donald Trump, it's time to cut a deal.\n\nBut China didn't cut a deal -- and now it is paying a price. Those who suggest Trump started this trade war with China have it backward. Beijing has been waging economic warfare on the United States for years -- stealing our intellectual property, forcing our companies to transfer technology as a price of doing business in China and subsidizing state-owned enterprises to prevent U.S. businesses from competing in dozens of sectors of the Chinese economy. The difference now is Chinese leaders are facing a president who is willing to fight back.\n\nChina apparently didn't think Trump would do so. The Wall Street Journal reports that Chinese negotiators believed they had leverage because Trump \"was worried about the future course of the U.S. economy and therefore may be more eager to do a deal.\" Big mistake. The U.S. economy is booming, unemployment is at the lowest level in five decades, and wages are rising. In fact, America's biggest economic problem is that we have more job openings than unemployed people to fill them.\n\nChina's economy, by contrast, is in trouble. Last year, China reported its slowest economic growth since 1990, and the Financial Times reports that many experts \"believe its official data understates the true extent of the slowdown.\" While the United States has added about half a million manufacturing jobs since Trump took office, China's manufacturing sector is shedding jobs. And the Chinese population is aging rapidly as birthrates are falling, which means the workforce is becoming smaller and less productive.\n\nOur economic strength against China's relative weakness gives Trump leverage in this standoff, and he is using it. Trump knows the United States can better withstand a trade war than China and that President Xi Jinping needs a deal more than he does.\n\nTrump is wrong when he says tariffs are good for our economy because China is paying us \"hundreds of billions of dollars\" in tariff revenue -- money he can use to help farmers withstand the blow of lost sales to Beijing. China is not paying the cost of tariffs. American businesses and consumers are paying. But the fact that Trump mistakenly believes tariffs are good for the economy should have sent a signal to Beijing. He thinks he's in a win-win situation, and that means, in this game of chicken, Trump is not going to blink.\n\nAnd while China is not paying the cost of the tariffs, their impact on U.S. consumers may not be as bad as some observers predict. As my American Enterprise Institute colleague Derek Scissors points out, our low rate of inflation neutralizes much of the costs of higher prices from tariffs, which will diminish over time. \"If the US places 25 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports and no substitution for those goods and services occurs, the additional cost would be $145 billion. That's a bit over one percent of 2018 consumer spending,\" Scissors writes, but \"the cost will certainly not that be that high, because substitution will occur. And the cost will fall over time as more producers enter to replace Chinese.\"\n\nIn other words, our dynamic, growing, low-inflation economy can handle a trade war with China. That does not mean China will buckle easily. State ownership is the means by which the Communist Party directs the Chinese economy. Getting China to stop subsidizing large sectors of its economy, and to cease its theft of U.S. intellectual property, will be extremely difficult. But Trump knows he has no chance of doing so by filing complaints with the World Trade Organization. He is right to take a hard-line stance.\n\nIt's much easier to question the wisdom of launching trade wars with allies such as Canada and the European Union. But we should all be able to agree that China is an economic predator against which we need to fight back. Trump is using tariffs to force China to open its markets to free trade and competition. Every American should be standing behind the president as he does so -- just like Chuck Schumer.\n\nStephen K. Bannon: We're in an economic war with China.

But it's looking more plausible that we face a protracted, destructive trade war and that Trump will end up with either no deal or a bad deal, either of which would badly undercut him on a signature issue heading into 2020, particularly if the extensive damage from his trade war continues to mount.\n\nYet it's hard to escape the sense that Democrats are eyeing this debate from a defensive crouch. As Catherine Rampell notes, the 2020 candidates have mostly been \"muted\" and \"mealy-mouthed\" in their criticism of Trump's handling of the issue, blasting him for not going far enough against China, rather than forcefully pointing out that his brand of protectionism has, so far, been disastrous for the country, including for his constituencies.\n\nBut why? My best guess: This is another issue where Democrats have decided Trump has a mystical hold over the industrial Midwest. Trump's demolishing of the \"blue wall\" of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin was so traumatic that Democrats just can't shake the impression that he has a spider-sense of how this issue plays there that they can't begin to fathom.\n\nYou saw this for a time with immigration as well, but after Trump made the border central to the 2018 elections, leading to the biggest GOP wipeout since Watergate, that spell was mostly broken. On trade, maybe not so much.\n\nBut I'd like to suggest another way. If things continue, Democrats will have a major opening to reframe the trade debate in their favor, by replacing the \"free trade vs. protectionism\" frame with a \"reality-based multilateralism vs. destructive unilateral America-First Trumpism\" frame.\n\nJoshua Green has a good report on the argument among the 2020 Democratic candidates over who is best positioned to win back the Midwest. As Green notes, the only top-tier Democrat who voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump campaigned relentlessly against, is Joe Biden.\n\nThat raises questions as to whether the other Democrats -- particularly Bernie Sanders, a longtime critic of NAFTA, and Elizabeth Warren, who helped sink the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal -- might fare better than Biden on this issue against Trump, who would hit Biden with the same populist attacks he waged against Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt's not clear how much this will matter to Democratic primary voters. As Green notes, Trump has so polarized the issue of trade that many Democratic voters now support what pollsters call \"free trade.\"\n\nWhat's more, as Green also notes, it's not clear whether other Democrats are right in arguing that Biden would be debilitated on this issue against Trump, since he's got deep labor support and is associated in the region with Barack Obama's bailout of the auto companies.\n\nAll those things will be litigated in the primaries. But either way, it seems plausible that whoever the Dem nominee is, the truly dominant factor will be Trump's failures on the issue.\n\nBiden's team already appears to appreciate this. As Green reports:\n\nDespite his early stumble on China, his advisers say he's prepared to weather attacks on his trade record, wherever they come from, and roll out a plan of his own. That will likely include calls for better worker and environmental protections -- and a multilateral approach to getting tougher on China, to contrast with Trump's volatile solo style.\n\nWhether or not NAFTA support is a liability, the Democratic nominee, whoever she is, will likely embrace some sort of progressive trade agenda that restores multilateral cooperation, with an eye toward agreements that boost wage and labor standards, and a multilateral response to Chinese trade practices.\n\nTrump crows about his toughness toward China. But as Paul Krugman notes, Trump hasn't built an international coalition against China's abuses. Instead, he's waging trade wars on multiple fronts, infuriating allies, so the war with China is better seen as an outgrowth of a broader series of disasters flowing from his xenophobic nationalism and general desire to tear down the international trading order.\n\nLet's not forget that in 2018, Republicans lost all six statewide races in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Sure, Trump is a different animal from those GOP candidates. But still, Trump's trade war with China is unpopular.\n\nA Post/ABC News poll from July 2018 found that only 40 percent of registered voters nationwide thought trading tariffs with China will help U.S. jobs, vs. 56 percent who thought it would hurt.\n\nThe trade war is also unpopular in the industrial Midwest: According to the Post polling team, among voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Iowa, those numbers were 39 percent to 59 percent.\n\nIf Trump's trade wars continue to harm the country, he'll be vulnerable to this contrast. And I suspect this debate will be colored by the broader unpopularity of America-First Trumpism. It's no accident that Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate deal and his disastrous immigration policies have also proved deeply unpopular.\n\nThe public is now seeing the reality of \"America First\" as a basis for complicated policy decisions in an increasingly interdependent world, and recoiling at it. This isn't a debate Democrats need to fear.\n\nCatherine Rampell: Democrats should be shouting Trump's trade failures from the rooftops\n\nGreg Sargent: Trump is staking reelection on one of his biggest lies\n\nMarc A.

Rather than insist his trade war with China will eventually work out for the best, he insists it's already coming up roses.\n\nAs Trump has ratcheted up the trade war in recent days, he has sent a multitude of tweets defending it. Most of them contain falsehoods or carefully worded claims that seem geared toward leaving people with a false impression.\n\nWitness his Tuesday morning tweets.\n\n\"In one year Tariffs have rebuilt our Steel Industry -- it is booming!\" Trump said in his first tweet.\n\nThe tariffs have certainly benefited the steel industry at least somewhat, creating or saving as many as 12,700 jobs, according to the Alliance for American Manufacturing (which supports the tariffs). But one estimate puts the cost of those jobs at $900,000 a piece, given the tariffs. And as the New York Times reported this year, the number of jobs in the steel industry is still below where it was just four years ago, and investors have taken a dim view of the industry.\n\n\"Booming\" is certainly a subjective claim, but the numbers and indicators don't seem to back it up.\n\nTrump continued: \"We are now a much bigger economy than China, and have substantially increased in size since the great 2016 Election.\"\n\nThe clear suggestion is that these tariffs have created a shift in the relative strength and sizes of the two country's economies. When Trump says, \"We are now a much bigger economy than China,\" he makes it sound like that's a new development.\n\nBut the U.S. economy has been much bigger than China's for a very, very long time. And in fact, despite some slowing in China's GDP growth rate, it's still growing about twice as fast as the U.S. economy -- and closing the overall gap.\n\nLater, Trump tweeted, \"This money will come from the massive Tariffs being paid to the United States for allowing China, and others, to do business with us,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly suggested that China is paying the tariffs, even though that's simply not true. His own chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, admitted as much this weekend. China may suffer in other ways, but not by directly paying the tariffs.\n\nHere, Trump doesn't repeat the claim, but he sure seems to suggest it. When he cites \"the massive Tariffs being paid to the United States,\" he leaves out the fact that the ones paying those \"massive Tariffs\" are U.S. companies. If something is \"being paid to the United States,\" it sure makes it sound like it's coming from outside the United States. He has apparently been chastened by Kudlow's interview, but only so much.\n\nThen there's this tweet from Monday: \"The unexpectedly good first quarter 3.2% GDP was greatly helped by Tariffs from China. Some people just don't get it!\"\n\nLet's, for a moment, set aside the \"Tariffs from China\" sleight of hand (which we explained above). Trump says these taxes on U.S. companies are actually helping the U.S. GDP.\n\nExcept Kudlow himself acknowledged just the day before that they weren't. \"We reckon it would be about two-tenths of 1 percent of GDP\" lost, he said, referring to the entire U.S. GDP of around $20 trillion. That's $40 billion, which is enough to drop the growth rate by 0.2 percent -- or turn a 3.2 percent GDP growth rate into a 3 percent rate. Other estimates have suggested a similar or even bigger drop in the GDP, and the drop could grow with the new tariffs Trump has now tacked on.\n\n(Philip Bump has a rundown of Trump's previous bogus claims, for those interested in more.)\n\nNone of which is to say the trade war might not ultimately turn out. Most estimates suggest China is suffering a heavier toll. That is perhaps to be expected given it sends much more to the United States than vice-versa -- and that the initial tariffs focused on elastic industries in which there are alternatives to importing from China.\n\nBut that's not really the argument Trump is making. He's suggesting there isn't much of a price to be paid by the United States at all, and even that China is basically footing the entire bill. He's claiming much more immediate benefits than the evidence bears out.\n\nAnd that's not leveling with the people who are on the business end of all this.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yCYmanLzVZi5fAFd_ktnrlbpH8s=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3CRTDCLFW5DQFCHJQGCGBW4XRI", "eventUri": "eng-4783551", "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 295544280}, {"uri": "1135855417", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-14", "time": "15:13:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-14T15:13:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4392156898975372, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/upshot/us-china-trade-war.html", "title": "Why the U.S.-China Trade War Could Be Long and Painful: No Off-Ramps", "body": "There's a shrinking supply of the 'constructive ambiguity' that would let each side present a deal as a win.\n\nJust two weeks ago, the United States and China seemed to be gliding toward a trade deal meant to resolve tensions between the world's two largest economies.\n\nBut the breakdown in talks since then -- including the United States raising tariffs to 25 percent on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatening to tax an additional $300 billion -- worries people who study international economic diplomacy.\n\nThat's because both the United States and China seem to be digging into their positions in ways that will be hard to resolve with the kinds of mutual face-saving that typically turns high-stakes negotiations into deals.\n\nTo use a common negotiating metaphor, it is not clear what the off-ramps are that might allow a de-escalation and prevent a major trade war that would prove costly to both nations.\n\nIn effect, President Trump appears to view continuing tension with China as good for him politically and has said, contrary to the view of mainstream economists, that tariffs are a reason for the United States' recent economic good fortune.\n\nChina's leaders may not reveal their thinking in real time on Twitter, but they have signaled that many of the concessions the United States wants would require China to sacrifice core parts of its economic strategy and national sovereignty -- in particular its ambitions to lead in the high-tech industries of the future.\n\n\"Each side has dug itself into some fairly deep holes such that it will be difficult to emerge from,\" said Douglas Rediker, chairman of International Capital Strategies and a former U.S. representative to the International Monetary Fund. As is often the case in negotiations, the pathway to a deal may rest in \"constructive ambiguity\" that both sides can present to their domestic audiences as a win.\n\n\"Do I believe there's enough room to find common ground?\" Mr. Rediker said. \"Yes, but only based on this ambiguity that doesn't necessarily resolve the issues in one party's favor or another.\"\n\nBoth sides have taken subtle steps to allow time for last-ditch efforts at some agreement. China sent a senior negotiator to Washington last week despite the breakdown in talks, and it delayed the start of its retaliatory tariffs on American imports until June 1; the United States applied the newest wave of higher tariffs based on when ships containing the affected goods arrive, adding a few weeks in which a reversal could be hammered out.\n\nAnd President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China could meet at the G20 summit in late June in Osaka, Japan, which would be an opportunity for de-escalation at the highest levels.\n\nBut open lines of communication and time to work won't by themselves solve the problem of how to finesse some mutually agreeable deal -- particularly given that both countries view this negotiation as resetting their economic relationship in ways that would have long-lasting consequences.\n\nAdd in Mr. Trump's tendency to view every negotiation through a zero-sum prism, and it may be hard to find a pathway for both parties to go home able to proclaim victory.\n\nWhen the negotiations seemed to be going well a few weeks ago, \"I thought we were going toward constructive ambiguity,\" said Mary E. Lovely, an economist and trade expert at Syracuse University's Maxwell School.\n\nThe United States is demanding that China codify rules to protect American companies and their technology doing business in China into law. Chinese negotiators now reject that possibility (American officials have said they earlier agreed to those provisions).\n\n\"It looks like there was a level of specificity that China wasn't willing to accept and a level of ambiguity that the Trump administration wasn't willing to accept,\" Ms. Lovely said. \"It looks like the Chinese are firm that there are some areas where they are not willing to go, that they see as disrespectful.\"\n\nIf the escalation now being signaled by both sides goes into force, it will mean Americans face higher prices for a wide range of the goods they buy, and certain American manufacturers will face less demand for their products. Already, American farmers are suffering amid reduced Chinese demand for American soybeans and other products. The Chinese manufacturing sector is hurting as well -- and is likely to suffer further if tariffs reduce American demand for their products or drive relocation of production to other countries.\n\nUltimately the question becomes how much of that pain each side will be willing to endure, and whether the two nations' leaders feel a sense of urgency to each help the other save face domestically.\n\nThings can change quickly. In a different sphere, for example, Mr. Trump went from threatening North Korea with nuclear annihilation to acting like old friends practically overnight.\n\nBut given where things stand, it may take that kind of surprising reset between two top leaders, built on personal relationships, rather than the slow grind of hammering out an agreement that is more typical of economic diplomacy.\n\n\"The off-ramps are tricky here because the president believes this is good policy and the Chinese are loath to cave on it,\" said Jay Shambaugh, a professor of international economics at George Washington University and director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. \"It's not abundantly clear how you climb down without any damage.\"\n\nThe question for the weeks and months ahead is how much damage each side will tolerate before rethinking some of those basic assumptions and deciding that they don't want to dig in quite so hard, after all.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_irwin@nytimes.com", "name": "Neil Irwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/14/upshot/up-trade/up-trade-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4783551", "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 295542780}, {"uri": "1135851992", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-14", "time": "15:09:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-14T15:09:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6039215922355652, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/05/14/trump-tries-calm-public-says-hell-reach-deal-with-china-when-time-is-right/", "title": "Trump tries to calm public, says he'll reach deal with China 'when the time is right'", "body": "Shipping containers sit stacked at the Yangshan Deepwater Port, operated by Shanghai International Port Group Co.

Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg (Qilai Shen/Bloomberg) By Taylor Telford and Taylor Telford Reporter covering national and breaking news Damian Paletta Damian Paletta Reporter covering economic policy May 14 at 9:19 AM\n\nAfter trade talks with China decayed into an all-out tariff war that left Wall Street reeling and threatened across-the-board price increases for American consumers, President Trump sought Tuesday to reassure the public that a deal would come \"when the time is right.\"\n\nThe comments marked a reversal from the strident attacks he leveled at China on Monday. They came in a series of early morning Twitter posts after some Republican senators began questioning his tactics and prominent Democratic rivals saw an opening for attack.\n\n\"The American worker is getting killed by this,\" former Vice President Joe Biden said Monday on WMUR, a New Hampshire radio station. \"The American farmers are getting killed.\"\n\nTrump's new assurances seemed to placate investors, as stock markets appeared to have stabilized after their worst one-day performance in months.\n\nIn a matter of days, a trade deal Trump had said was \"95 percent\" finished imploded, with the White House slapping steep tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese products, and the Chinese government retaliating with tariffs on $60 billion in American goods. On Monday, prospects of a cease fire appeared slim when Trump announced he was preparing to expand U.S. tariffs to cover all $540 billion in Chinese imports. This could interrupt the global economy and raise prices on everyday products from cellphones to sunglasses.\n\nBut in a Tuesday morning tweetstorm, Trump claimed that a deal was still within reach and that relations between the two nations could recover.\n\n\"My respect and friendship with President Xi is unlimited but, as I have told him many times before, this must be a great deal for the United States or it just doesn't make any sense,\" Trump tweeted Tuesday.\n\nThis marked a continuation of assurances Trump tried to give Monday night, when he told a group gathered at the White House that he would know in three or four weeks whether a deal could be reached.\n\n\"I have a feeling it's going to be very successful,\" Trump said.\n\n[White House explores new farmer bailout plan as U.S.-China trade war heats up]\n\nThere were signs on Tuesday that his approach with China remained very fluid, consistent with the multiple strategies he has laid out for the public in the past week. He said, for example, that one of the best ways for the U.S. to counter China's behavior would be for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.\n\n\"If the Federal Reserve ever did a 'match,' it would be game over, we win!\" he wrote. Trump has been trying to pressure the Fed to cut interest rates for weeks, though he has never used this argument before in relation to China and trade.\n\nIn other tweets Tuesday, Trump seemed to be goading Beijing into making a deal before the situation worsened, repeating warnings that U.S. companies were likely to move operations outside China and take their business to countries not subject to tariffs. He also claimed that the revenue from the tariffs would be used to protect farmers from the impact of the trade war, and said that tariffs he imposed last year had \"rebuilt\" the steel industry.\n\nTrump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from a range of countries, including Canada and Mexico. The U.S. doesn't import much steel or aluminum from China, but Trump has alleged that his actions targeted Chinese production.\n\nThough the metal tariffs helped U.S. steel companies increase revenue because their competitors' costs rose, a number of U.S. companies said their expenses also escalated because they rely on foreign production. In October, Ford's chief executive Jim Hackett said higher steel prices would cost Ford an estimated $1 billion, even though the automaker acquires most of its steel and aluminum from U.S. companies. It projected that global tariffs would cost the company $700 million in 2019, according to Reuters. The Council on Foreign Relations predicted that the high costs from the steel tariffs could trickle down to American workers, leading to more than 40,000 job losses.\n\nTrump has vacillated between vowing to dig in against China and predicting a deal between the two countries could be weeks away. He also has argued that only China would feel the effects of a trade war, and not the U.S. But if Trump did levy a 25 percent tariff on all Chinese imports, U.S. economic output would shrink by at least $120 billion \"as companies would have to rebuild entire supply chains,\" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in an investor note.\n\nCorporate earnings, the key to stock prices, would drop around 10 percent, he added.\n\nStill, Trump tweeted that the U.S. is \"in a much better position now\" than if a deal had been reached, but still stressed that \"China wants a deal!\"\n\nWith hopes fading for an early resolution of the yearlong U.S.-China trade dispute, the president said he would meet the Chinese president at the G-20 leaders summit in Osaka, Japan, on June 28-29. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC that the two sides remained in \"ongoing\" negotiations.\n\nThe prevailing tension and uncertainty sent U.S. stock markets tumbling on Monday.

The American farmers are getting killed.\"\n\n[U.S. prepares to slap tariffs on remaining Chinese imports]\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said he planned to write a letter to Trump to explain the concerns of farmers because he felt the argument he had repeatedly made to the president in person was not registering.\n\n\"I'm not sure if you talk to him face to face he hears everything you say,\" said Grassley, who has emerged as one of Trump's chief critics on the administration's trade approach in recent weeks.\n\nPressed for details of the plan on Monday, Trump told reporters, \"It's being devised right now.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump wrote on Twitter that \"our great Patriot Farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries\" of his trade policies. He said that would come either from China buying more U.S. products or U.S. government making up the difference.\n\nOne idea under consideration would be an expansion of bailout funds from the Commodity Credit Corp., a division of the Agriculture Department.\n\nTrump already directed that the department pay out $12 billion to farmers last year who said they were rapidly losing funds because of new import penalties from China. But China signaled Monday that it plans to dramatically increase its restrictions in retaliation for tariffs that Trump has imposed on Beijing.\n\nSen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), who chairs the agriculture appropriations subcommittee, said U.S. officials would use a type of \"market facilitation payment\" but also make direct purchases on behalf of the government from U.S. producers.\n\nHe did not specify how much money would be directed to these initiatives, but he said some of it would be paid for with money that the Treasury Department brings in through tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\n[Trump says he'll reach deal with China 'when the time is right']\n\nWhite House officials and Senate Republicans are looking for new ideas because many farmers are growing increasingly anxious as the trade war with China enters a second year. Soybean farmers, in particular, have been hit hard, but pork producers have also said they are experiencing a major impact. Other groups, including cherry producers, have said their businesses are suffering immensely.\n\nTrump has long promised farmers that the trade deal with China would lead to enormous benefits for U.S. agriculture companies, and he has even tried to negotiate direct purchases of U.S. produce from the Chinese government.\n\nBut when broader trade talks faltered last week and Trump slapped 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods, China immediately moved to retaliate, and a number of U.S. farm products will be impacted. China is one of the biggest markets for U.S. farm exports, and a shift in demand can leave many farmers without alternatives.\n\nHoeven said there was a chance that White House officials could attempt to purchase U.S. farm products and then give them to poor countries. A similar program was established under the Food for Peace Act.\n\nBut government officials have found that these programs are very difficult to administer, in part because it can be hard to move crops on a large scale to poor countries efficiently. There are also concerns that dumping large amounts of crops can disrupt the local farming infrastructure, and some poor countries do not need certain crops that could be in abundance in the United States, such as soybeans.\n\nIn addition, Grassley said there are strict limits on how U.S. officials could simply donate food to poor countries. He said the way Trump has discussed it could violate World Trade Organization rules.\n\n\"It's fair to say that I want to point out that there's problems with what he's planning to do, and he ought to take those into consideration,\" Grassley said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Monday, Trump mentioned how he planned to give assistance to farmers, but he did not offer specifics in part because White House officials have not decided exactly how to proceed.\n\nHe estimated that the total aid package would be around $15 billion, which would come in addition to the $12 billion the White House gave farmers last year.\n\n\"They'll be planting,\" he said. \"They'll be able to sell for less, and they'll make the same kind of money until such time as it's all straightened out.

He is widely regarded as an autocrat in Europe; presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama had pointedly avoided hosting him.\n\nBut it's Trump's Washington now. And with the Dow Jones industrial average tanking on Monday by more than 600 points amid a fresh round of tit-for-tat tariffs in the U.S.-China trade war, the president welcomed Orban to the White House -- perhaps less worried about his illiberal policies and more about finding an ally in the battle against Beijing.\n\nKen Weinstein, president of the conservative Hudson Institute think tank, suggested to Politico that China was the most pressing reason for Orban's visit, saying the subtext of the trip was \"likely China, on Orb\u00e1n's relations with the Chinese and trying to get greater cooperation on this issue.\"\n\nYet despite some signs of personal affinity, Orban is likely to disappoint Trump on China. Under his leadership, Hungary has grown close to Beijing in recent years, part of a turn away from the West that has also seen the nation build ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Orban opened up the country to telecom giant Huawei Technologies and was the first European Union leader to express support for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Chinese President Xi Jinping's massive international infrastructure investment that is frequently criticized in Washington.\n\nJust last month, Orban visited Beijing, where Chinese state media reported that he said BRI was \"an opportunity rather than a threat.\"\n\nShouldn't Orban be lining up with Trump on China? Hungary is a NATO ally, and the tough-talking prime minister was an early supporter of Trump's presidential campaign. He has aligned with Trump on a host of controversial international issues, including immigration and religion.\n\nMeanwhile, China's unfair trade policies, egregious human rights abuses and worrying geopolitical ambitions pose a problem for countries all over the world. The United States is also the larger economic power, and most experts say Washington can inflict far more pain on the Chinese economy than Beijing can deal to the U.S. economy in retaliation.\n\nBut instead, Orban looks like he is sitting on the fence.\n\nThe truth is, Hungary is far from the only U.S. ally to try to avoid picking sides in the trade war. And it's not too hard to see why when you consider how much other countries have to lose. Americans are worried about this week's stock market tumble, but that outlook is far worse for countries that aren't an economic behemoth like the United States.\n\nSome nations are particularly hesitant to move away from the Chinese economic links they've established in the last few years. Huawei, the telecommunications firm at the center of American anxiety about Chinese influence in Hungary, is an excellent case in point.\n\nWashington may warn of security risks, but low-cost technology from Huawei is already in place for numerous U.S. allies; removing it ahead of upgrades to 5G networks would be prohibitively expensive for many countries, and the United States would do little to make up for the cost.\n\nThere is some serious collateral damage from Trump's tariffs, too. Some targeting Beijing, such as those on steel and aluminum imports based on \"national security,\" have also significantly hit U.S. allies. Rather than rallying potential allies to the China fight, Trump's unilateral trade actions are punishing them, too.\n\nIf the trade war intensifies, they might end up stuck between Washington and Beijing. Canada already found that out the hard way after it arrested Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on an American warrant in December. The impact wasn't just financial: Two Canadian citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, have been detained in China since the end of last year on deeply dubious charges.\n\nThe Trump administration loves to talk tough on trade and foreign policy. Over-the-top, arguably xenophobic language against China by Trump allies and surrogates may have pushed some allies away, especially as the administration veers close to conflict in Iran, Venezuela and North Korea.\n\nBut it's not just the Trump administration's hawkish leanings that may worry allies. It's also its unpredictably dovish ones. Only a week ago, most of the world expected Trump, a lover of signing deals, to accept a watered-down agreement from China. Now the trade war is back and bigger than ever.\n\nTrump's apparent U-turn seems to have been motivated largely by China's slow-rolling of negotiations. But some pundits also believe that Trump is positioning himself for the 2020 presidential election, when he believes that China could become a major issue in the battle against a Democratic challenger. Could Trump back down again, should the economy take a harder hit or the political calculation change in another way?\n\nIn that scenario, Beijing's relations with Washington might improve, but its smaller allies might remain exposed (see here: Canada). Even if Trump keeps a hard line on China, he might fail to win a second term. It is unclear who would replace him and what their China policy might be.\n\nThis unpredictability may help in hard bilateral negotiations, but it doesn't exactly foster alliances. Given the circumstances, it's not surprising that weaker allies are staying out of the fray. Writing from Australia over the weekend, the New York Times's Neil Irwin noted that the \"bifurcating world trade system has created new urgency in trying to keep options on both sides.\"\n\nFor a small country like Hungary -- \"fragile and threatened\" due to its size, as Orban puts it -- the best option may be to not pick sides, but to wait and see what he can extract from both parties in a bidding war. This week, he got a White House meeting with Trump ahead of upcoming European Parliament elections. Not too shabby.\n\nOf course, this Hungary first policy is at odds with U.S. interests, but who can blame Orban? Even Trump himself probably appreciates the chutzpah. The Hungarian prime minister is\"probably, like me, a little bit controversial,\" Trump told reporters in the White House on Monday. \"But that's okay.\"\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

Such developments reveal the risks of Trump's protectionist instincts, his fundamental misunderstanding of how both trade and trade negotiations work, and his inability to learn the lessons of the trade war that deepened the Great Depression.\n\nAll this should be great ammunition for Trump's rivals. Why isn't it being used?\n\nRepublicans, of course, are too cowardly to challenge Trump on much of anything. But Democrats, particularly those angling for the presidency, should be shouting from the rooftops. They should be sharing soybean-farmer sob stories and damning stats with any voter still considering following Trump off the protectionist cliff. Especially given academic research finding that \"Trump Country\" has been hurt most by his trade conflicts.\n\nInstead -- with rare exceptions -- Democrats have been muted or mealy-mouthed in their criticism. Perhaps this is because, when it comes to trade policy, most of them don't have a leg to stand on.\n\nThis weekend, when asked what she thought of Trump's trade wars, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) said she objected to Trump's preference for \"conducting trade policy, economic policy, foreign policy by tweet.\" She also said Trump \"failed to understand that we are stronger when we work with our allies on every issue, China included.\"\n\nSo far, so good. But when pressed, she said she wouldn't have voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement, aligning her with Trump's own negative assessment of the deal.\n\nAnd if you look back at Harris's record in the Senate, you'll find that she, just like Trump, opposed then-President Barack Obama's strategy to \"work with our allies\" to keep China in line on trade. That was the 12-country pact known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which Trump pulled us out of with support from other 2020 Democratic candidates, too, including Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio), and Democratic leaders such as now-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.).\n\nSome Democratic presidential candidates, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), have also offered vague statements of displeasure over Trump's trade actions, then suggested Trump's protectionism doesn't go far enough. Diehard protectionist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) endorsed Trump's metal tariffs, even if he thought Canada and the European Union should have been exempted.\n\nRather than rethinking their protectionist instincts after seeing the consequences of Trump's trade policies, some Democrats have doubled down.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) cheered on Trump's escalation of tariffs on Chinese goods in a tweet last week. Sanders is trying to use Democratic front-runner and former vice president Joe Biden's past support for the TPP and other trade deals against him.\n\nThese are bizarre choices, and not only because economists and historians no longer have to conjure up fuzzy memories of the Great Depression to explain why trade barriers can backfire, or reference abstract theories to illustrate why being left out of new free-trade pacts, including the recently reconstituted TPP, puts the United States at a disadvantage.\n\nThese are also strange positions to take because they run counter to the views of most Democratic voters.\n\nDemocrats, it turns out, have become fiercely free trade, as illustrated by recent polling compiled last fall by Cato Institute adjunct scholar Scott Lincicome.\n\nFor instance, the Pew Research Center found that 67 percent of Democrats (vs. 43 percent of Republicans) believe that free-trade agreements have been good for the United States. A separate question found that 77 percent of Democrats (and 18 percent of Republicans) said increased tariffs between the United States and some trading partners will be bad for the country.\n\nTo some extent these policy positions -- like all policy positions -- are influenced by respondents' attitudes toward the polarizing guy in the White House. But even before Trump ran for office, Democratic voters were more positive on trade than the politicians in their own party.\n\nThe issue, of course, is that even if most Democratic voters are pro-trade, trade probably isn't the most important issue to them. But smaller constituencies for which trade is especially important, such as organized labor, tend to be trade-skeptical.\n\n\"There are probably more voters that are litmus-test protectionist than litmus-test free traders,\" Lincicome says.\n\nBut pandering to the tiny minority of protectionists is short-sighted, particularly if doing so hurts the economy in the medium term and U.S. alliances in the long term. Democratic voters turn out to be pretty enlightened when it comes to the economic and diplomatic benefits of trade; it's past time that the people chosen to represent them catch up.\n\nThe Post's View: Trump's biggest mistake in the trade war with China\n\nJennifer Rubin: How much pain is Trump going to inflict on those who elected him?\n\nCatherine Rampell: Trump's two worst economic ideas collide\n\nHenry Olsen: Republicans want Trump to give up on his tariffs.

The United States trade representative on Monday detailed a list of what would face a tax of as much as 25 percent, which includes nearly 4,000 product categories.\n\nMr. Trump said on Monday he had not yet decided whether to impose the tariffs, but his administration has begun the formal process necessary for the United States to make good on his threat.\n\nOfficials said that the new batch of tariffs \"covers essentially all products not currently covered\" by Mr. Trump's existing tariffs on Chinese imports, but that the list \"excludes pharmaceuticals, certain pharmaceutical inputs, select medical goods, rare earth materials, and critical minerals.\"\n\nSo what would get hit with tariffs? The list reads like a shopping list for Target or Walmart, including toys, shoes, coffee makers and watches. Smartphones, photocopiers and video game consoles will face a tax. Also included are guns, fireworks, backgammon, Christmas decorations, practical joke toys, furs (with or without paws) and merry-go-rounds.\n\nThe list includes nearly 40 Chinese import categories that Americans collectively spent $1 billion or more on in 2017, according to government statistics. The largest among those, at $44.5 billion, are cellphones, followed by laptops at $37.2 billion and toys at $12.2 billion.\n\nHere's a quick scan of other consumer favorites that will be subject to tariffs if Mr. Trump follows through:\n\nHousewares\n\nKitchenware\n\nLED lamps\n\nFlags\n\nMicrowave ovens\n\nCurtains and drapes\n\nCoffee makers\n\nHair dryers\n\nBed linens\n\nClothing\n\nSweaters\n\nShoes, including golf shoes, boots, running shoes and other footwear\n\nBras\n\nGloves\n\nSunglasses\n\nWigs and facial hair made of human hair\n\nT-shirts\n\nTrack suits\n\nTech\n\nSmartphones, like iPhones\n\nFlat-panel televisions\n\nCopiers and fax machines\n\nVideo cameras\n\nLithium ion batteries\n\nKeyboards\n\nLoudspeakers\n\nSporting goods\n\nGolf clubs\n\nWater skis, surf boards and other water sport equipment\n\nBicycle parts\n\nFishing rods\n\nMilitary rifles, shotguns and their parts\n\nRocket launchers and flame throwers\n\nDrugstore essentials\n\nGreeting cards\n\nArtificial flowers\n\nFlashlights\n\nPens\n\nMr. Trump has insisted that the tariffs will not raise prices for consumers, saying that China will bear the brunt of the taxes, a view that many economists dispute.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump encouraged companies to avoid tariffs by moving production out of China and into the United States or a country like Vietnam. He said the next round of tariffs represented \"a tremendous amount of money that would come into our country.\"\n\nShifting production across borders would be difficult for some consumer-facing companies to do quickly, said Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS and former head of the price and wage section at the Federal Reserve.\n\nThat means consumers could have little choice but to pay more for those goods, or buy fewer of them. It's likely that the result will be higher consumer inflation.

None. Not a clue.\n\nI know that he can be clever politically, in a tactical sense. I know that his lies are often both deliberate and effective. I know that his utter shamelessness can sometimes come off as some kind of warped genius. But the only thing that's profound about Trump is the truly spectacular depth of his ignorance. As evidence, take a glance -- if you dare -- at your 401(k).\n\nThe president's decision last week to unilaterally boost tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports produced an entirely predictable response -- retaliatory tariffs from Beijing on $60 billion worth of U.S. products, a freakout by the financial markets and a screaming plunge in the Dow and other major indexes.\n\nThe administration's trade talks with China had reportedly been going well and were supposed to be nearing an end. Trump accused the Chinese of trying to renege on concessions at the last minute, but the president's history suggests otherwise. Veterans of the high-stakes world of New York real estate have told me about what they described as Trump's standard negotiating practice -- pitching some kind of fit at the very last minute, when the other party thought things were settled, in hopes of bullying his way to a better deal.\n\nThat might work with a subcontractor who doesn't have the power to say no, or even with a fellow developer who vows on the spot never to do business with Trump again. But would any skilled negotiator think such a stunt would work with China, the world's second-greatest economic power? Wouldn't the Chinese government have to react in kind, if only as a matter of sovereign pride? And wouldn't startled investors conclude that their fear of a serious trade war -- the kind with no winners, only losers -- had been realized?\n\nI assume Trump realizes that China isn't really \"paying\" the tariffs and that the cost is actually borne by U.S. consumers, who will pay higher prices for made-in-China goods. Either the president constantly lies about this on his Twitter feed, hoping to fool the gullible, or he's even more clueless about trade than I imagined.\n\nHere are a few confident predictions: In the end, Trump will have succeeded only in further spooking the skittish financial markets. If there is a U.S.-China deal, it will be no more favorable -- perhaps less favorable, I fear -- than the deal Trump could have gotten before his little power play. And if there's not a deal, well, the president will spend the summer trying to badger the Federal Reserve into cutting interest rates in an attempt to keep the economy from sliding into recession.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump will scramble to ease the pain he is causing his red-state supporters to suffer. He said Monday he will somehow channel billions of dollars in what amount to welfare payments to farmers whose livelihood depends on selling soybeans and other products to China. This is typical Trump -- make a mess, then try to clean it up. It is no way to run a mom-and-pop store, let alone a great nation.\n\nIt was Jeb Bush who warned that Trump would be \"a chaos president,\" and he was right. Alas for the world, the administration's willy-nilly approach extends beyond trade policy.\n\nOne of Trump's most significant foreign-policy decisions was to withdraw last year from the nuclear deal that the Obama administration had reached with Iran -- even though the Trump administration acknowledged that the Iranians had been faithful to the agreement. Iran and other signatories are still observing the 2015 deal's terms, yet Trump has steadily increased U.S. pressure on the Iranian economy. But to what end?\n\nPredictably, Tehran is bristling. As tensions rise, world leaders have become concerned that the United States and Iran could bluster and blunder their way into armed hostilities. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo crashed a meeting of European Union foreign ministers Monday to ease the diplomats' fears. Reportedly, he failed.\n\nNo one can have any confidence that this administration has thought out a step-by-step plan for anything. Look at the situation in Venezuela. There, the administration took a page from the Obama playbook -- multilateralism -- and assembled an impressive coalition of nations to demand President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's ouster. But the effort to depose Maduro has failed, and he retains the support of the powerful military. Now what?\n\nThere are many fitting words to describe the Trump administration. One of the simplest is \"dumb.\"\n\nRead more from Eugene Robinson's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

Trump's combative approach to trade has been one of the main constants among his often-shifting political views. He's showing no signs of backing off now even as the stakes intensify with the threat of a full-blown trade war between the world's two biggest economies. (Evan Vucci/AP) By Jared Bernstein Jared Bernstein Jared Bernstein, a former chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden, is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and author of 'The Reconnection Agenda: Reuniting Growth and Prosperity'. May 13 at 1:53 PM\n\nLate last week, President Trump ramped up his trade war with China by raising the tariff rate on $200 billion of Chinese imports (that's 40 percent of our Chinese imports) from 10 to 25 percent. The Chinese quickly retaliated by raising their tariffs on U.S. imports.\n\nWhy is this happening and where is it going?\n\nOne reason for the trade war is that Trump views the trade deficit as a scorecard, and he believes tariffs will reduce our $500 billion deficit with China (that's over 2 percent of GDP; our China goods deficit was $540 billion last year, offset by a $40 billion surplus in services). That might be right, but he's just playing trade-balance-whack-a-mole, as importers shift to other suppliers. For various reasons (stronger U.S. growth boosting the dollar, both of which increase net imports), the U.S. trade deficit is likely to grow over the next year. And in terms of its economic impacts, it's the total trade deficit that matters, not the balance with individual countries.\n\nThen there's the fact that Trump -- and here, his view is the dominant one among economists and business leaders -- objects to China's disregard for the rules of international trade. They subsidize state industry, insist that multinationals sign joint venture agreements that transfer technology and raise other barriers to keep out businesses that threaten their control over their financial system (such as strict limits on foreign investments).\n\nFinally, the most immediate reason for raising the tariff rate is the claim by our negotiators that their Chinese counterparts backed away from legislating enforceable, transparent rules to block these practices.\n\nThe consensus among the punditry is that team Trump is correct to go after China's trade practices, but they're doing it the wrong way. First, sweeping tariffs like this won't work and will just hurt U.S. consumers and businesses. Second, instead of alienating our trading partners by also hitting them with tariffs, we should form a united front against China.\n\nBut is the consensus correct? Yes and no.\n\nDespite the president's repeated falsehoods that China pays the tariffs, the fact is they are borne by us, not them (they're paid first by importing firms who then try to pass the costs to consumers). Evidence shows that the tariffs are bumping up the prices of targeted goods and hurting both those who use imported parts to make things here and exporters facing retaliatory Chinese tariffs (i.e., U.S. farmers). That said, current conditions show that these disruptions are not yet of a magnitude to throw our economy off course.\n\nBut the \"tariffs won't work\" critique is weaker and lacks a compelling case about what would work better. For those of us who've long watched U.S./China negotiations, it looks like Robert E. Lighthizer (Trump's lead negotiator) has pushed the Chinese further and harder than any of his predecessors. Their theory, which may well be correct, is that they can't force China to play fair without at least temporarily hurting U.S. consumers and producers.\n\nThe argument that we should join with our traditional allies and form a united front against China is wishful thinking that ignores one of Trump's guiding lights: America First! In his mind, tariffs are a tool -- one a compliant Congress allows him to freely impose -- against any and all who sell to us. The simple fact is he doesn't like imports and believes import substitution, or the domestic production of goods we now buy from abroad, is an easy, win-win solution. In this regard, the fight with China is a war between two protectionist mercantilists.\n\nAlso (and I fear this aspect of the problem is underappreciated), he knows he can use trade negotiations (and Twitter) as a tool to drive the near-term stock market up and down. Never has a president played the markets like this, and I strongly suspect that Trump will continue to use this tool to his political advantage.\n\nFor these reasons, there's a good chance that, as long as Trump is president and the U.S. economy remains strong, trade wars will persist. Trump's negotiators believe that no one before them has played this level of hardball with China, and that's what it will take to move Beijing. And he'll continue playing yo-yo with the stock market, while fruitlessly waiting for the import-substitution fairy to do her thing.\n\nFor the rest of us, that will mean a bit more inflation, but price growth has been so low that most consumers will barely notice the extra 0.2 percent increase in inflation some are predicting. Certain producers and exporters will be hurt, as will their work forces. But compared to every other advanced economy, the U.S. is insulated from trade. We import 15 percent of our GDP and export 12 percent. For most of our trading partners, those shares are doubled or tripled.\n\nTo understand the real damage, you have to turn to historians of trade wars (here's a good summary), especially those who link the geopolitical risks engendered by the intersection of nationalism, populism and protectionism. History suggests that these forces can lead to problems from underdeveloped industries to dangerous political alliances (\"Many historians contend [that Smoot-Hawley] ... contributed to the rise of the Nazis and other fascist parties.\").

He has suggested over and over again that China pays the tariffs, when that's simply not how tariffs work. They are taxes on imports, paid by U.S. companies. And those costs are often passed down to consumers, in the form of higher prices.\n\nIt was a reality that Trump's chief economic adviser tried to avoid Sunday -- but couldn't.\n\nNational Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow appeared on \"Fox News Sunday,\" where Chris Wallace pressed him on Trump's factually incorrect claims about tariffs.\n\n\"Larry, that isn't true,\" Wallace said. \"It's not China that pays tariffs; it's the American importers.\"\n\nKudlow responded: \"Fair enough. In fact, both sides will pay. Both sides will pay in these things.\"\n\nBut that wasn't sufficient for Wallace. So he pressed again.\n\n\"But the tariff on goods coming into the country, the Chinese aren't paying,\" Wallace said.\n\nKudlow again conceded that what Trump was saying was wrong: \"No. But the Chinese will suffer GDP losses and so forth with respect to a diminishing export market and goods that they may need for their own -- \"\n\nWallace again cut in.\n\n\"I understand that, but the president says .\u2009.\u2009. that China -- it pays the tariffs. They may suffer consequences, but it's U.S. businesses and U.S. consumers who pay, correct?\" Wallace asked.\n\nKudlow again conceded the point, but also tried to argue that China pays a price, too, because of lost exports: \"Yes, to some extent. Yes, I don't disagree with that. Again, both sides will suffer on this.\"\n\nTrump seems to have processed the fact that his own aide contradicted him. On Monday morning, he offered a slightly altered case for who pays the tariffs. This time, rather than saying China was paying them, he said U.S. companies could simply avoid them by not buying Chinese goods -- the true intent of the tariffs.\n\n\"Also, the Tariffs can be .\u2009.\u2009. completely avoided if you buy from a non-Tariffed Country, or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea),\" Trump said. \"That's Zero Tariffs.\"\n\nBut then Trump couldn't help himself. He later attributed the relatively strong 3.2 percent annual GDP growth rate in the first quarter to his tariffs.\n\n\"The unexpectedly good first quarter 3.2% GDP was greatly helped by Tariffs from China,\" Trump said. \"Some people just don't get it!\"\n\nOne of those people who apparently doesn't get it: Larry Kudlow.\n\nThere was a lesser-publicized portion of the above interview in which Wallace presented Kudlow with some estimates of how much the trade war is costing the U.S. economy. Kudlow took issue with the estimates but proceeded to admit the trade war both cost jobs and hurt the gross domestic product.\n\n\"We reckon it would be about two-tenths of 1 percent of GDP,\" Kudlow said. \"So it's a very modest number. We have a $20 trillion GDP.\"\n\nHe added later that \"I think this is a risk we should and can take without damaging our economy in any appreciable way.\" And he said that \"the economic consequences are so small that the possible improvement in trade and exports and open markets for the United States, this is worthwhile doing.\"\n\nBut here's the thing: \"Two-tenths of 1 percent of GDP\" isn't really all that modest. With the current GDP around $20 trillion, that amounts to about $40 billion. That's less than the other estimates Wallace brought up, but it's still a hefty chunk of annual GDP growth -- about 7 percent. If you lopped that off the GDP growth rate, you'd go from 3.2 percent to 3 percent.\n\nThere's also the broader point of exactly how much this is directly hurting U.S. consumers. And this chart should put to rest the idea that the tariffs aren't causing them pain. It looks at the consumer price index for nine tariff-impacted categories and compares it to all other goods. You'll note that the prices of the other goods have continued a steady decline from before the tariffs were first implemented, while the tariff-impacted categories took a sharp upturn.\n\nThe point is not that Trump's trade war is inherently bad -- just that he has broadly misrepresented it. And now he has been roundly contradicted by his own top economic adviser. Kudlow admits that \"both sides will suffer,\" which means the United States will suffer -- and is suffering. He says that suffering is part of playing the long game.\n\nTrump, though, would like to argue that he's also winning the short game. The problem is he doesn't seem to understand how it's played.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UlEk7qcDEVJattXJE4fcittmP8o=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2HZSK3DVGQI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4783551", "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 295462200}, {"uri": "1135034509", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-13", "time": "16:42:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-13T16:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/05/13/trump-warns-china-not-retaliate-tariffs-insists-they-wont-hurt-us-consumers/", "title": "Trump's trade approach under attack as China retaliates on tariffs; markets open with big sell-off", "body": "Beijing announces steep tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. goods in response to White House action By Taylor Telford , Taylor Telford Reporter covering national and breaking news Damian Paletta and Damian Paletta Reporter covering economic policy Gerry Shih Gerry Shih China Correspondent May 13 at 10:45 AM Beijing announces retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. goods: \"China will never succumb to foreign pressure,\" says Foreign Ministry spokesman. Dow plunges more than 500 points at market open as investors price fallout of trade tensions. In tweets Monday morning, President Trump insists his tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports won't hurt American consumers, contradicting recent comments from National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow.\n\nPresident Trump's efforts to calm investors while he launches a full-scale trade war with China showed signs of cracking Monday, as one of his top advisers admitted the approach could damage the U.S. economy, a Goldman Sachs report predicted it might lead to higher interest rates, and China vowed to impose tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. goods on June 1.\n\nChina's response, announced by its Ministry of Finance, said it targeted \"U.S. unilateralism and trade protectionism.\"\n\nThe rapid-fire succession of stark economic news spooked financial markets. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index are both down sharply in morning trading. While many business executives and investors had hoped that tensions between the United States and China would be resolved easily, the recent developments show how much each country is digging in for a long fight.\n\n\"Over the past week, hopes for at least a partial and temporary cease-fire between the two sides have given way to the prospect of a rapidly escalating and broadening economic conflict between the two countries,\" said Eswar Prasad, senior professor of trade policy at Cornell University.\n\n[Trump's go-it-alone approach on trade, immigration poses risks]\n\nAmid signs that investors were questioning his adversarial approach, Trump attempted to assuage the public in a series of Twitter posts. But some of his tweets contained typos and misspellings, suggesting that his comments had not been thoroughly vetted by White House officials and might not represent fully planned-out policy initiatives.\n\nThe dramatic escalation came last week after Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese imports to the United States. He also told aides to begin plans to hit more than $300 billion in other Chinese goods. Trump has alleged that the Chinese government is ripping off American consumers and businesses by unfairly subsidizing Chinese companies, stealing intellectual property from U.S. firms and flooding global markets with cheap goods to put other companies out of business.\n\nOn Monday, he warned China against retaliation in a series of early-morning tweets. But China showed it planned to counter his adversarial approach with its own penalties against U.S. companies. The Chinese government said it would impose tariffs on U.S. imports starting on June 1, with the steepest penalties hitting textile products, certain kinds of beef and coffee, and technology such as microwave ovens, printers and solar batteries. The tariffs would range from 5 percent to 25 percent.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Monday that Beijing did not believe raising tariffs would solve \"any problems,\" but he warned that China would be ready to defend itself.\n\n\"China will never succumb to foreign pressure,\" he said. \"We are determined and capable of safeguarding our legitimate rights and interests. We still hope that the U.S. will meet us half way.\"\n\nShortly after the finance ministry announced the retaliatory tariffs, an anchorman for the state broadcaster read an official government commentary in a live prime-time segment addressed to the Chinese people.\n\n\"If we discuss, our door is always wide open; if we fight, we'll fight to the last,\" CCTV anchorman Kang Hui said to an audience that was likely in the tens, if not hundreds, of millions. \"The U.S.-initiated trade war with China is just a hurdle in China's development process. It is no big deal. China must strengthen its confidence, overcome difficulties, turn crisis into opportunity, and fight to create a new world.\"\n\nThe nationalistic notes Kang struck quickly became the most searched subject on Chinese social media Monday evening.\n\nU.S. agriculture companies could be hit hard by the new penalties, which would make their products more expensive for Chinese buyers. U.S. farm groups have already complained to the White House that they have been caught in the middle of Trump's trade skirmish and that the president had pledged to assist them. Trump has said he would seek an additional $15 billion in U.S. taxpayer money to aid farmers.\n\nTrump has suggested that the impact of the tariffs on U.S. consumers could be mitigated by simply buying American-made products or those manufactured in countries not subject to the tax. He also claimed that the tariffs would drive business away from China and warned that the situation \"will only get worse\" if a deal is not reached.\n\n\"Their [sic] is no reason for the U.S. consumer to pay the Tariffs, which take effect on China today,\" Trump tweeted. \"Also, the Tariffs can be completely avoided if you by [sic] from a non-Tariffed country, or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea.)\"\n\nTrump's comments about the effects of the tariffs clashed with those of National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, who acknowledged that Americans will pay the price in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\n\"It's not China that pays tariffs,\" host Chris Wallace said. \"It's the American importers, the American companies that pay what, in effect, is a tax increase and oftentimes passes it on to U.S. consumers.\"\n\n\"Fair enough,\" Kudlow replied. \"In fact, both sides will pay. Both sides will pay in these things.\"\n\nAfter a tweet from an editor of the Global Times, a Chinese state-affiliated media outlet, suggested that China might cease purchases of U.S. agricultural products and reduce Boeing orders, the embattled aircraft manufacturing company signaled optimism in a statement Monday to CNBC.\n\n\"We're confident the US and China will continue trade discussions and come to an agreement than benefits both US and Chinese manufacturers and consumers,\" Boeing said.\n\nThe new U.S. tariffs largely affect business equipment, but they also apply to $40 billion in consumer products such as air conditioners, furniture, clothing and spark plugs. The financial impact of the tariffs could be delayed because they will apply only to products that left China on Friday; it typically takes two to three weeks for shipments to arrive from Shanghai. But businesses often pass these costs on to consumers, which could drive up prices across the country.\n\n\"The costs of U.S. tariffs have fallen entirely on U.S. businesses and households, with no clear reduction in the prices charged by Chinese exporters,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note to investors Monday. It also said \"the effects of the tariffs have spilled over noticeably to the prices charged by US producers competing with tariff-affected goods.\"\n\nThe analysts wrote that the tariffs could pose a double-whammy to the U.S. economy by driving up the cost of goods and potentially leading the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to counter inflation. That could further slow the economy.\n\nTrade experts and business groups have said Trump routinely misstates how tariffs work. Tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. companies that bring in products from overseas. So those costs are borne by companies like manufacturing firms, chemical producers and others that rely on Chinese products. This drives up the cost of Chinese products, which Trump has said will help U.S. competitors, but it also pushes up the cost for U.S. companies that use Chinese products. The tariffs could end up hurting companies and economic growth in both countries.\n\nTrump imposed a series of tariffs on many Chinese goods last year and threatened to impose steeper penalties in January, but Chinese officials agreed to negotiate with him as a way to prevent more damage to their economy. Those talks began in earnest in December and continued into this year, with Trump at one point saying he predicted it could be the \"granddaddy\" of all trade deals.\n\nBut Trump expressed frustration with the pace of trade talks and threatened to impose steep tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports two weekends ago. China's vice premier, Liu He, came to Washington last week but those discussions didn't break new ground, and the tariffs went into effect early Friday morning. U.S. officials accused China of going back on prior details of the deal; China denied this.\n\n\"They were constructive discussions between both parties, that's all we are going to say.

(Qilai Shen/Bloomberg) By Jennifer Rubin Jennifer Rubin Opinion writer covering politics and policy, foreign and domestic Opinion writer May 13 at 11:15 AM\n\nIn an interview Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" former treasury secretary Hank Paulson was asked about the latest round in the tariff war that Trump has embarked upon with China. (On Friday, Trump raised tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent.) Paulson replied, \"You're darn right I don't like tariffs.\" He continued:\n\nWhy don't I like them? Because they're a tax on the American consumer. But I see an even more perverse effect with tariffs. Those who do us the great honor of investing in America, of doing business with our companies and suppliers, do so because we've always had predictable, reliable economic policies. Tariffs jeopardize that.\n\nPaulson suggested that politicians could always try \"the tactic of working with our allies to put pressure\" on China. Trump did the opposite: He backed out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (which excluded China) and picked trade fights with Europe and Canada.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) made the same point as Paulson earlier on the program, explaining, \"What I would do differently is mobilize the world against China's mercantilist trading policies, which the president is right to point out have been unfair.\" However, Bennet warned that \"putting tariffs on our allies, putting tariffs on even the Chinese that are actually taxes on American producers, American farmers, taxes on the American consumer and taxes on the American worker, I think are completely the wrong way of doing this. I can assure you the Chinese have a longer attention span that Donald Trump has.\"\n\nTrump still seems to believe that someone other than U.S. consumers and importers pay the tariffs. (He might consult National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, who was forced to fess up that Trump's claim is false.) If Trump acknowledged reality, he'd have to admit that he's effectively raised taxes on these businesses, farmers and consumers.\n\nTrump's trade tax on Americans should be an inviting target for Democrats, but too many of them have fallen in love with protectionism.\n\nWhen Trump says we're getting wealthier from all those tariffs, he means the government is getting more revenue from Americans. (That would be like a President Elizabeth Warren saying we're getting richer by raising income taxes.) Trump is either willfully ignorant or simply unwilling to recognize the extreme hardship he is inflicting on many Americans, especially in deep-red farm states.\n\nEven Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), ordinarily one the most emphatic apologists for Trump, argued on ABC's \"This Week\" that for some companies, \"the tax cuts specifically helped them but that the tariffs are almost equal in punishing them.\" He continued:\n\nThe farmers in Kentucky are concerned about the tariffs, and I've talked to the administration about this. I've said my concern is that the great benefits of the tax cut, which have low unemployment and incredible economic growth, could be raised by this tariff war as we ratchet it up with China. I'm very concerned.\n\nHowever, we're in the middle of this and the president is playing ... a negotiating battle with the Chinese, and I think he feels that at this point they can't really back out. I think there are ways the Chinese market could open up and that would be good, but I still have advised the administration, get this done, because the longer we're involved in a tariff battle or a trade war, the better chance there is that we could actually enter into a recession because of it.\n\nUnfortunately, Trump has no idea how to \"get this done,\" which is why he is now suggesting that our economy benefits with tariffs in place (something virtually no credible economist would agree with).\n\nTrump needs to \"win\" in China negotiations for the 2020 election; China plays the long game over decades to achieve its economic aims. Trump therefore is far more likely to be pushed into a cruddy deal that he'll try to dress up as a win than China is to cut him a break and make critical concessions.\n\nIf some voters seem rather unimpressed with Trump's tax cuts, it might be because between rising health-care costs and tariffs (a.k.a. Trump's trade tax), they don't feel richer. And if you are a farmer or other resident in the heartland who now sees farm-belt bankruptcies soaring and massive floods (which Trump will not acknowledge is one dangerous consequence of climate change), you might think Trump, the king of debt and tax losses, is just another slick politician who lied to you.

Dragging the Dow were Apple, Caterpillar and Boeing. The blue chip index was headed for its lowest close since January.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 2.25 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell nearly 3 percent, continuing last week's losses. Eight out of 11 market sectors were in negative territory an hour after U.S. markets opened. Utilities, real estate and consumer discretionary were the only bright spots.\n\nBoth S&P and Nasdaq were on track for their lowest close since March. Stocks were seeing their biggest decline since Jan. 3.\n\n\"Today's tit-for-tat in U.S./China trade tariffs has exacerbated tumbling futures out of fear that tensions could trigger a global recession,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\n\n[China retaliates, will raise tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. goods]\n\nThe drama began last week after President Trump last week imposed a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese imports to the United States. He also told aides to begin plans to hit more than $300 billion in other Chinese goods.\n\nAsian markets were down more than 1 percent on China's response, with the Shanghai Composite dropping 1.2 percent and Japan's Nikkei 225 down just shy of 1 percent. European markets were down across the board, with the German Dax leading the drop, off 1.5 percent. France's CAC had fallen 1.2 percent and the Pan European Stoxx 600 was off 1.2 percent.\n\nAdding to the pressure on stocks was a Saudi news report that said two Saudi oil tankers had been attacked with \"significant damage\" in coastal waters near the Persian Gulf, heightening tensions with Iran.\n\nThe tankers were subjected to an \"act of sabotage\" early Sunday morning in waters off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, according to a statement by the Saudi Minister for Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, Khalid Al-Falih carried by the official Saudi news agency.\n\nSaudi Arabia did not say who was responsible for the attack, which caused no casualties or oil spill, according to the statement.\n\nOil futures rose on the news, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate climbing 1.6 percent and Brent crude up nearly 2 percent.\n\n\"Stock investors are in risk-off mode this morning as Trump's trade war with China seems to be escalating while negotiations seem to be breaking down,\" said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. \"Adding to the geopolitical tumult is mounting tension in the Middle East following the sabotaging of Saudi oil tankers over the weekend.\"\n\nThe president has alleged that the Chinese government is ripping off U.S. consumers and businesses by unfairly subsidizing Chinese companies, stealing intellectual property from U.S. firms, and flooding global markets with cheap goods to put other companies out of business.\n\nOn Monday, he warned China against retaliation on tariffs in a series of early morning tweets. But China countered with its own tariffs. The Chinese government said it would impose tariffs on U.S. imports starting on June 1, with steepest penalties hitting certain beef, live plants, dyed flowers, and a range of fruits and vegetables. The tariffs would range from 5 percent to 25 percent.\n\nTechnology stocks were taking a hit Monday, with all five FAANG stocks - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet - in the red.\n\nApple shares were off nearly 5 percent because of the risk that a China trade war would hurt Apple revenue in that country. The shares also were reacting to a Supreme Court ruling on Monday that allows iPhone users to sue the phone giant over the prices at its App Store.\n\nAnother high profile technology company, Uber Technologies Inc. shares fell $3, more than 7 percent, Monday in its second day of trading. The ride-hailing company debuted Friday at a price of $45 per share. Shares in the company, which is the most anticipated initial public offering of the year, are 15 percent off their opening price on Friday.\n\nx\n\nMonday's skid comes on the heels of the first weekly decline of 2019 in U.S. stocks.\n\nThe S&P 500 eked out a gain Friday on speculation the escalation won't derail global economic growth, paring its loss for the week to 2.2 percent. That's the steepest drop since the five days ended Dec. 21, when stocks were tumbling toward the brink of a bear market. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 2.1 percent to 25,942. Apple Inc. was among the worst decliners in the 30-member gauge as the iPhone maker's close ties to China put its profits at particular risk. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 3 percent.\n\n[Dow claws out of 359-point hole to end a wild week]\n\nThe sell-off started Monday after Trump's weekend tweets threatening to more than double tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, which he then followed through on.

We keep hearing that this shows Trump \"doesn't understand\" how tariffs work.\n\nBut this is better seen as a straight-up, deliberate lie -- a lie upon which Trump is staking his reelection.\n\nA long-term trade war with China now looks plausible. Trump hiked tariffs to 25 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods on Friday. Monday morning, China announced it will retaliate with new tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods.\n\nIf this does continue, Trump's lie about China paying us billions in tariffs will become ever more imperative for him.\n\nThat's why it's such a big deal that Fox News's Chris Wallace debunked this falsehood by getting economic adviser Larry Kudlow to admit that China is not paying the tariffs. In fact, they amount to a tax on U.S. consumers:\n\nBut this lie is not a mere superficial sign of Trump's failure to understand how trade works. Rather, it's becoming central to the political strategy he'll employ if we see protracted trade hostilities.\n\nTrump is in a jam on trade\n\nTrump's trade war has put him in a jam. Revamping trade with China was a central campaign promise. But if Trump agrees to a deal that does not win real concessions, that will reveal his agenda of \"toughness\" as hollow -- particularly if those concessions do not appear worth the pain that the tariff wars have already imposed on farmers, in the very region that's crucial to his reelection.\n\nSo the New York Times reports that Trump is now hoping to flip the political calculus: No deal, followed by still more tariffs, will allow Trump to proclaim he's still being tough on China. Incredibly, the Times reports that Trump apparently believes this will be a political winner even if increased tariffs impose still more economic pain.\n\nHere's where Trump's lie comes in\n\nHow is this possible? Enter Trump's lie. The new, convoluted story he's telling is basically that the money we \"take\" from China in tariffs will be given to farmers in exchange for their products, which we will then export to other countries that need them.\n\nIt's unclear how this would work. But Trump is set to approve another round of financial aid to farmers hit by his trade war. Basically, the claim will be that continued tariffs are a good thing: Trump is in effect taking money from China and giving it to his voters.\n\nThere are three possible resolutions here, as The Post's Heather Long explains. We could end up with no deal and a full-blown trade war. We could end up with a bad deal -- U.S. companies don't get improved access to expanding Chinese markets and many tariffs remain. Or we could get a good deal -- an end to unfair Chinese trade practices, access to Chinese markets and real enforcement mechanisms.\n\nThe lie that China is paying us tariffs will be necessary if one of the first two scenarios happens. The third could still happen, but even if it does, Trump's lie is still just that -- a lie -- and it's obviously central to his backup plan.\n\nTrump's narrative about China, repurposed\n\nNotably, this backup plan repurposes the story that Trump has told about China for years: that China is robbing U.S. workers blind. Throughout 2015 and 2016, he claimed that China is \"ripping us off\" and is our \"economic enemy,\" targeting us with the \"greatest theft in the history of the world.\"\n\nIt's true that China is a bad international actor and that Trump did tap into real grievances about globalization. But as Paul Krugman notes in the New York Times, Trump hasn't built an international coalition against China's abuses. Instead, he's waging trade wars on multiple fronts, alienating allies, so the one with China is better seen as an outgrowth of his desire to tear down the international trading order.\n\nIn this regard, go back and watch Trump's closing 2016 ad. It depicts a shadowy globalist plot, via imagery of George Soros (hint, hint), Asian business executives, Democratic politicians and Chinese sweatshop labor. The story: Globalist elites are enriching themselves by pitting foreign low-wage workers against U.S. workers. (The better answer to this story is the progressive trade agenda, which includes international wage and labor standards and real investments in displaced workers.)\n\nSome observers look at Trump's trade wars and still manage to see hints of his supposed economic populism, in which Trump vowed to defy GOP economic orthodoxy. But, given that Trump has gone all in with GOP plutocracy on taxes and shredding the safety net while punting on infrastructure -- three areas where he'd supposedly defy that orthodoxy -- the real story is obvious. Trump's \"economic\" populism remains operative only in areas that satisfy his xenophobic nationalist impulse to attack other countries as our enemies -- immigration and trade.\n\nIndeed, it's no accident that Trump also vowed to make Mexico \"pay\" for his border wall, to punish Mexico for \"sending\" us their outcasts and pitting them against U.S. workers, similar to his claim about China.\n\nCentral to this whole tale has always been the idea that Trump will take back for U.S. workers what this alliance of elites and foreign workers is stealing from them -- he will take back what is rightfully theirs.\n\nGiven all this, failure on China could be catastrophic for Trump. So he's just swapping in a new story: He's making China pay restitution to Americans it has ripped off for so long by forcing it to \"pay\" us in tariffs.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0HroggYz6I-62CI5lCViWtvByaA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3PEIJCDVOUI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4783551", "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 295455480}, {"uri": "1134902040", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2019-05-13", "time": "13:52:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-13T13:52:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/companies-bracing-for-chinas-retaliation-in-tariffs-dispute/2019/05/13/e72127fe-757a-11e9-a7bf-c8a43b84ee31_story.html", "title": "Trade row deepens as China ups tariffs on $60B in US goods", "body": "By Joe McDonald\u2009|\u2009AP May 13 at 9:33 AM\n\nBEIJING -- Deepening a trade battle and sending financial markets spinning, China announced Monday it was raising tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods in retaliation for the latest hike in U.S. tariffs on its exports.\n\nThe Finance Ministry said Monday the new penalty duties of 5% to 25% on hundreds of U.S. products including batteries, spinach and coffee will take effect June 1.\n\nThat followed Trump's increase on Friday of duties on $200 billion of Chinese imports from 10% to 25% after charging that China had backtracked on commitments it made in earlier negotiations in a dispute over Beijing's technology ambitions and perennial trade surplus.\n\nResuming his messages over Twitter early Monday, President Donald Trump warned Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) that China \"will be hurt very badly\" if it doesn't agree to a trade deal.\n\nTrump tweeted China \"had a great deal, almost completed, & you backed out!\"\n\nTrump insisted the tariffs the U.S. has placed on Chinese goods don't hurt American consumers, saying there is \"no reason for the U.S. Consumer to pay the Tariffs.\"\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow acknowledged Sunday that U.S. consumers and businesses pay the tariffs. \"Both sides will pay,\" he told Fox News.\n\nChina had vowed \"necessary countermeasures\" on Friday against Trump's escalation of the tariff conflict.\n\nFrazzled by the uncertainty, shares sank Monday across the globe. Futures contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were down 2 percent before markets opened on Wall Street.\n\nBeijing is running out of U.S. imports for penalties due to the lopsided trade balance between the world's two largest economies. Regulators have targeted American companies in China by slowing down customs clearance for shipments and processing of business licenses.\n\nThe new tariffs are likely to hurt exporters on both sides, as well as European and Asian companies that trade between the United States and China or supply components and raw materials to their manufacturers.\n\nThe increases already in place have disrupted trade in goods from soybeans to medical equipment and sent shockwaves through other Asian economies that supply Chinese factories.\n\nForecasters have warned that the U.S. tariff hikes could disrupt a Chinese recovery that had appeared to be gaining traction. Growth in the world's second-largest economy held steady at 6.4% over a year earlier in January-March, supported by higher government spending and bank lending.\n\nThe tensions \"raise fresh doubts about this recovery path,\" Morgan Stanley economists Robin Xing, Jenny Zheng and Zhipeng Cai said in a report.\n\nThe latest U.S. charges could knock 0.5 percentage points off annual Chinese economic growth and that loss could widen to 1 percentage point if both sides extend penalties to all of each other's exports, economists say. That would pull annual growth below 6%, raising the risk of politically dangerous job losses.\n\nThe latest talks ended with no word of progress on Friday. Chinese officials said they hoped that the U.S. side would meet them halfway, describing the standoff as just a \"setback.\"\n\nTrump might meet his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, during next month's meeting of the Group of 20 major economies in Osaka, said Kudlow, his economic adviser.\n\nChinese officials have invited the top U.S. envoys - Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin -to Beijing, Kudlow said on Fox News. But he said there were no \"definite plans.\"\n\nChina's state media has sought to reassure businesses and consumers that the ruling Communist Party has the resources and policy tools to respond to the dispute with Washington.\n\n\"There is nothing to be afraid of,\" said the party newspaper People's Daily. \"The U.S.-instigated trade war against China is just a hurdle in China's development process. It is no big deal.\"\n\nTrump started raising tariffs last July over complaints China steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.\n\nWashington wants Beijing to roll back government support for Chinese companies striving to become global leaders in robotics and other technology. The U.S. and other trading partners say such efforts violate Beijing's free-trade commitments.\n\nA stumbling block has been U.S. insistence on an enforcement mechanism with penalties to ensure Beijing carries out its commitments. Economists say Chinese leaders probably reject that as a violation of Chinese sovereignty.\n\nThe abruptness of Trump's announcement on May 5, just days before the last round of talks, about raising tariffs to 25% made companies see doing business in China as more uncertain, said Jake Parker, vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, an industry group.\n\nNo matter what Washington and Beijing decide, \"there is an enormous risk in the background that tariffs could come back into play at any moment,\" he said.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

(Paul Yeung/Bloomberg) By Daniel W. Drezner Daniel W. Drezner Daniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a regular contributor to PostEverything. May 13 at 8:15 AM\n\nLast month, when the conventional wisdom was that the Trump administration was close to completing trade negotiations with China, I gently suggested that \"unless Trump decides to slap more tariffs on China .\u2009.\u2009. none of it will mean a thing.\"\n\nUnfortunately, it turned out I was correct, and hey, guess what, Trump slapped more tariffs on China! So what does it mean? It means that, yet again, the United States will be enduring a natural experiment to see what happens when the president opts for a suboptimal strategy.\n\nI will leave the economic implications to others -- the Cato Institute's Scott Lincicome has an excellent Twitter thread breaking that down. Rather, the hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts is more interested in the political economy of these negotiations. And there are three large questions that will need some answering by, oh, say, the fall of 2020:\n\n1. What is Donald Trump's theory of victory? On Sunday, Trump tried to do his best impression of someone who is sure of their savvy negotiating strategy:\n\nI have gotten pretty good at deciphering the meaning behind Trump's gibberish, but to be honest this is too much gobbledygook even for me. More importantly, Trump's claim that China is paying for the tariffs has been refuted by every respectable economist -- and even a few disreputable ones, such as Trump adviser Larry Kudlow:\n\nEven Kudlow admits that this latest move is a lose-lose gambit. Obviously, the hope is that economic pain now will pressure China into greater concessions in the future.\n\nHere is what I want to know: what does victory in the trade wars look like to the Trump administration? It is clear that the Trump administration desires a complete rethink of China's role in the global economy. The problem is that it is not at all clear if the administration possesses the negotiating savvy and resources to execute this kind of move.\n\nAs the New York Times's Keith Bradsher and Ana Swanson reported over the weekend, \"the administration has struggled to address the immensity of the problems in the text of a trade deal. People close to the talks say that the negotiators appear powerless to force any changes that aren't in China's interest.\"\n\nThis is of a piece with the larger problem with Trump's negotiating style. This administration is very fond of \"maximum pressure\" campaigns, but has largely failed to coerce much weaker states into compliance. Indeed, the very fact that China has not acquiesced to date suggests that Trump's threats have either been not credible or not potent. Trump has made the economic pressure more potent now, but it is far from clear that China will buckle.\n\nTrump seems to think that even if the trade wars get worse, the United States will be just fine. At some point, however, it might dawn on this administration that other countries are continuing to sign trade deals with each other and getting along just fine, disadvantaging U.S. consumers and producers. Which leads me to the next question . . .\n\n2. Will Trump's agricultural base hold firm? Trump won in 2016 in no small part because farmers liked him. Even during the midterms last fall, there were press reports about how they were willing to stick by the president. As the costs of the trade wars mount, however, farmers are starting to feel squeezed. The New York Times's Mitch Smith reports that their patience is starting to wear thin:\n\nThough Mr. Trump pledged Friday to help farmers -- part of the coalition that put him in office -- there were signs of frustration. They raised questions about his negotiating tactics. They said they were worried about what would come next given an already-struggling agricultural economy.\n\n\"Many people are just torn because people want to support the president of the United States,\" said Nancy Johnson, the executive director of the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association. \"But it's very stressful to be in the middle of these very challenging negotiations. Because you're the person who can't take hope to the banker to get his loans for operating.\" . . .\n\nLance Atwater, 29, who farms corn and soybeans near Ayr, Neb., escaped the worst of the flooding but said that he has seen prices for some of his crops plunge. Mr. Atwater, a Republican who voted for Mr. Trump, said he was eager for a trade deal but taking a wait-and-see approach on the president's policies.\n\n\"He's claimed that he'll get these trade deals worked out and that it will be a better deal,\" Mr. Atwater said on Friday as he hauled grain. \"That's what we're wanting to see -- see those results.\"\n\nIt would seem that Trump needs to cut a deal at some point in the next 18 months. The question is the extent to which China believes it can exploit that need. Press reports suggest that China's trade negotiating position hardened when it saw Trump browbeating the Fed. President Xi Jinping might be willing to bide his time. Which leads to the last question . . .\n\n3. How long-lasting are the effects? Analysts like Paul Krugman believe that while the trade wars are not good policy, \"the short-run costs of trade war tend to be overstated.\" Krugman knows more about trade than I do, but I wonder if he is underestimating the effects of continued uncertainty on both short-term and long-term investment decisions. Much like economic sanctions more generally, trade sanctions are likely to kill investment, which in turn slows the economy down and affects long-term economic trajectories.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's long story on how the trade talks went south is worth reading in its entirety, but this part stood out: \"At stake are the rules for global trade in a world order upended by China's rapid rise, and both sides are keen to project an image of strength. The longer the dispute lingers, though, the greater the risk of economic fallout for both countries, along with prolonged uncertainty for global stock markets, which have whipsawed as expectations for a deal ebb and flow.\"\n\nChina's hand is stronger than Trump seems to realize. The Post's David J. Lynch notes that according to recent IMF data, \"China accounted for more than one-third of global economic growth -- roughly equal to the combined contributions of the United States, Europe and Japan.\" If Trump wants the rest of the world to make a binary choice between the United States and China, he is about to be sorely disappointed in the outcome.\n\nKrugman's long-term concern is that the trade wars are \"tearing down what's left of the Pax Americana\" by eviscerating the global trading system. That is a concern that I most definitely share. But it is the part of this natural experiment that I hope proves me wrong.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KZNAiugTVxZnkcIjkCfOCOzfIL0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7MV7CCDVEQI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4785183", "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 295448880}, {"uri": "1134521947", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2019-05-13", "time": "04:20:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-13T04:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/shares-fall-in-asia-after-no-deal-in-china-us-trade-talks/2019/05/12/39c1f5ae-7532-11e9-a7bf-c8a43b84ee31_story.html", "title": "Shares fall in Asia after no deal in China-US trade talks", "body": "By Elaine Kurtenbach\u2009|\u2009AP May 12 at 11:50 PM\n\nBANGKOK -- Shares were mostly lower in Asia on Monday after trade talks between the U.S. and China wrapped up Friday without an agreement.\n\nShares dropped more than 1% in Shanghai, to 2,909.60.

Mr. Kudlow said that any pain would be worth the price if it forced China to treat American companies more fairly.\n\n\"You've got to do what you got to do,\" Mr. Kudlow said. \"We have had unfair trading practices all these years and so in my judgment, the economic consequences are so small that the possible improvement in trade and exports and open markets for the United States, this is worthwhile doing.\"\n\nNegotiations between the countries broke down last week after administration officials accused the Chinese of backtracking on several key provisions of a proposed deal, including changes to Chinese law. Administration officials insist the talks have been constructive, and say they will continue, possibly including a meeting next month between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China at the Group of 20 summit meeting next month in Osaka, Japan. But Mr. Trump has muddied that message with tweets suggesting he would be happy to leave tariffs in place indefinitely.\n\nMr. Trump's confidence in the strength of the American economy is fueling his decision to escalate the trade fight. But it is an economic gamble, one that could inflict lasting damage depending on how far Mr. Trump is willing to take his battle and what it produces in the end.\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday, Mr. Trump said the United States was \"right where we want to be with China,\" adding that the United States \"will be taking in Tens of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs from China.\"\n\nEconomists differ on how much the trade war will crimp economic growth, but most agree that the cost of tariffs is passed on to businesses or consumers in the form of higher prices on everything, including lighting fixtures and art supplies. Among the items covered by the administration's latest increase in tariffs to 25 percent: computers, toilet paper, dog collars, Christmas tree lights and mattress supports.\n\nThe new tariff will not knock the American economy into recession, forecasters say, but it will hurt economic growth -- and could do so drastically -- if Mr. Trump follows through with his plan to place the tariff on all imports from China.\n\nThe United States imported $540 billion worth of goods from China in 2018, according to government statistics.\n\n\"Trump is dragging a dangerous misconception into a critical moment in his standoff with the Chinese,\" Chad Bown, an expert on trade at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said last week. \"And American businesses and consumers stand to pay the price.\"\n\nTariffs enacted last year reduced the inflation-adjusted income of American consumers by $4.4 billion each month by November, according to one study. That loss, which arose both from the tariff and from more expensive or foregone imports, breaks out to about $419 per household over a year. The latest round of increases will push the per-household cost above $800, said David Weinstein, a Columbia University economist and a co-author on the research.\n\nMr. Trump and his advisers insist his approach will ultimately pay off for the American economy -- either by prodding China to open its markets and treat American firms more fairly, or by encouraging companies to shift manufacturing to the United States to avoid tariffs.\n\nBut the decision to prolong the trade war could upend economic projections that showed robust hiring, growth and investment this year, in part because of fading concerns about a protracted trade fight. And it could defy steady predictions by administration economists that Mr. Trump's trade policy will help increase growth in 2019 to 3.2 percent -- well above what most other forecasters expect.\n\n\"There is absolutely no question that these tariffs, if imposed and sustained, increase the probability of a recession,\" Rob Martin, a former Fed section chief who is now an executive director at UBS, said of a potential escalation. \"It makes you more vulnerable.\"\n\nMr. Martin and his colleagues estimate that Mr. Trump's latest increase could shave 0.25 to 0.35 percentage points off gross domestic product over six months. If the remainder of China's products get hit with a 25 percent tariff, it could shave up to another full percentage point from G.D.P.\n\n\"If we move into that next tranche of tariffs, we're in 100 percent uncharted territory,\" Mr. Martin said. The products in that category are about two-thirds consumer goods and for many -- which could include toys, bicycles and iPhones -- it could be hard to find quick substitutes.\n\nBut a prolonged trade war could inflict damage on China's economy. Economic growth in China slowed in the second half of last year, in part because tariffs hurt business confidence. Since then, the Chinese government has poured billions of dollars into the financial system and pressed state-run banks into service extending credit.\n\nOfficials said last month that the economy grew 6.4 percent in the first quarter of the year, matching the pace from the previous quarter.\n\nBut Mr. Trump is clearly banking on a protracted fight to shift the economic calculus, warning China in a tweet that \"a deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term.\"\n\nWhile Mr. Trump is confident in his approach, his decision to add new trade barriers with China -- in the form of higher tariffs -- has confounded analysts and some business groups that have otherwise praised his handling of the economy.\n\nAnalysts at the Tax Foundation, a Washington think tank that forecast a large increase to economic growth from the tax cuts Mr. Trump signed in 2017, now say that the tariffs the president has put in place or threatened -- and the effects of Chinese retaliatory tariffs on American exporters -- would more than cancel out all the economic benefits of the tax law.\n\n\"The tariffs, if allowed to continue, will mute the economic benefits of tax reform,\" said Nicole M. Kaeding, a Tax Foundation economist -- particularly for low- and middle-income consumers who will be stuck paying higher prices. \"Economists argue about many things, but the impact of tariffs on the economy is not debated. They are harmful.\"\n\nMany of those groups say growth would be even stronger this year if Mr. Trump had reached a deal with China and averted a prolonged government shutdown. They blame Mr. Trump's fundamental misunderstanding of tariffs -- which he believes are lifting the economy -- for driving the country into a danger zone.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs said in a research note that further escalation of the trade war could reduce growth by nearly half a percentage point this year, and that \"if trade tensions sparked a major sell-off in the equity market, the growth impact could worsen considerably.\"\n\nStocks swooned last week but had begun to rebound by Friday afternoon. Financial conditions have tightened, but remain well below levels seen late last year.\n\n\"So far, U.S. markets don't express a lot of concern -- I think everybody expects a deal,\" said Roberto Perli, an economist at Cornerstone Macro. \"The risk is that time passes, nothing happens and the market realizes -- maybe we were too optimistic.\"\n\nMr. Trump has expressed satisfaction with \"big beautiful tariffs\" that he said were producing \"billions of dollars\" for America.\n\n\"I am very happy with over $100 Billion a year in Tariffs filling U.S. coffers...great for U.S., not good for China,\" Mr. Trump said on Twitter last week.\n\nOf the $419-per-household cost of last year's tariffs, most of the hit -- $286 -- came from the levy itself. Because the American government collected that money, it was able to redistribute it, including through a $12 billion program of farm subsidies. But that could change as the trade war persists.\n\n\"It's pretty likely that the tariff revenue is going to fall,\" Mr. Weinstein of Columbia University said, as firms find themselves unable to shoulder the higher rates and stop importing from China. \"We're going to see a lot of supply chains shifting around.\"\n\nThat means Chinese companies will also lose out as businesses buy more American-made goods or continue turning to other low-cost producers outside China, like Vietnam and Malaysia.\n\nMr. Trump's shift on tariffs appears to have surprised Fed officials, who had been expecting the trade dispute to calm down. This month, the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, told reporters at a news conference that risks to growth from trade policy had \"moderated somewhat,\" citing \"reports of progress in the trade talks between the United States and China.\"\n\nIt is unlikely that Mr. Powell and his colleagues will react quickly to the higher tariffs and renewed trade war. The Fed will most likely judge any inflation that comes from trade policy as temporary, and may want to see economic growth weakening before acting on it through a rate cut or other measures.\n\n\"The Fed is unlikely to act immediately, in part because it is unclear whether this drama will end in a deal, an all-out trade war or something in between,\" said Krishna Guha, head of the Global Policy and Central Bank Strategy team at advisory firm Evercore ISI.\n\nIf the central bank does react, it is more likely that it would cut rates to offset the economic pain. Raphael Bostic, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said at a National Association for Business Economics conference last week that the tariff increase could prompt a rate cut if higher costs cause consumers to pull back, \"depending on the severity of the response.\"\n\nMr. Guha concurred, saying that the Fed would not hesitate to react if there were signs of a real risk to economic growth. Instead, they will most likely \"cut rates on insurance grounds, in particular given weak inflation.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeanna_smialek@nytimes.com", "name": "Jeanna Smialek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/13/business/12DC-tradeecon/12DC-tradeecon-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4783551", "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 295403580}, {"uri": "1134416065", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-12", "time": "23:36:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-12T23:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4274509847164154, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trumps-go-it-alone-approach-on-trade-immigration-poses-economic-risks/2019/05/12/bb96cc0c-7349-11e9-9f06-5fc2ee80027a_story.html", "title": "Trump's go-it-alone approach on trade, immigration poses economic risks", "body": "By Damian Paletta , Damian Paletta Reporter covering economic policy Josh Dawsey and Josh Dawsey Reporter covering the White House Toluse Olorunnipa Toluse Olorunnipa White House reporter May 12 at 7:21 PM\n\nPresident Trump has moved dramatically to pull free from Congress in recent weeks by slapping huge trade penalties on Chinese imports and directing the construction of a wall along the Mexico border, looking to solve issues that dogged Democrats and Republicans for decades in a way that could help his reelection bid.\n\nThe risky moves mark Trump's attempt to deliver on two of his core campaign promises in the face of a Democratic House and muted GOP opposition in the Senate, seeking to cast himself as a defiant chief executive willing to act alone, no matter the global repercussions.\n\n\"The president is extremely comfortable in the job, more comfortable than he's ever been,\" said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), one of Trump's top congressional advisers. \"He feels he's gotten the rhythm.\"\n\nThe consequences of Trump's unilateral actions could be profound.\n\nWhen he declared a national emergency in February along the Mexico border, he rewrote the powers of the presidency to give himself authority to move taxpayer money to suit his demands. And the 25 percent tariffs he imposed against $200 billion in Chinese imports on Friday pit the United States against one of its largest trading partners, which may retaliate in ways that could cause the U.S. economy to shudder.\n\nIn both cases, he has seized on intractable problems -- on trade and immigration -- that both parties have long failed to resolve. His actions echo the \"I alone can fix it\" promise he made during his 2016 campaign, a vow that shocked many lawmakers at the time because of its imperial overtones.\n\nTrump portrayed himself as a pragmatic businessman who knew how to cut deals domestically and abroad. But time and again this year, he has shunned that approach by deciding to follow his own impulses.\n\n\"He just carries forward with what he wants to do, the Constitution be damned, the institutional guardrails be damned, professional guardrails be damned and the leaders of his own party be damned,\" said Barbara Perry, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs. \"No one is standing up to him, and they fear him now.\"\n\n[Trade war threatens to roil 2020 race as Republicans complain about the tariffs Trump loves]\n\nHis decision to take such extreme steps as he begins his reelection effort does not surprise many of his advisers. He has remained fixated on Mexico and China since the early days of his campaign, often invoking violent imagery when discussing both countries.\n\nDuring his campaign kickoff event in 2015, he said Mexico was bringing \"rapists\" into the United States, a phrase he used a year later referring to Beijing and trade. \"We can't continue to allow China to rape our country, and that's what they're doing,\" he said.\n\nA key element of Trump's new, unbound phase is the acquiescence of many Republicans who surround him, both inside the White House and on Capitol Hill. During the first two years of his administration, Trump was hemmed in by constraints -- including people who tried to limit his impulses and prevent quick decisions that might upset other parts of the Republican agenda.\n\nThen-National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn along with former staff secretary Rob Porter constrained Trump's efforts to rip up trade deals. Congressional Republicans urged the president to delay major decisions about building a wall on the border. Trump agreed, often reluctantly, to follow their advice, focusing instead on repairing the economy and building up momentum.\n\nThat has all changed this year.\n\nTrump is now surrounded by top advisers and GOP leaders who applaud and embolden his instincts. Numerous key agencies -- including the Pentagon, the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Homeland Security and the Small Business Administration -- are run by acting leaders who have not been confirmed for the posts by the Senate.\n\nThe decisions to act alone, without congressional approval, to crack down on China and use Pentagon money for a border wall also came during the first six months of acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's tenure. Mulvaney has set the tone for removing obstacles from Trump's path, and he and his advisers have said they are striving to \"let Trump be Trump.\"\n\nOn trade, this has freed the president to use his favorite economic weapon: tariffs.\n\nThe penalties are a type of tax imposed on U.S. imports and paid by U.S. companies that bring the products into the country. Trump inaccurately describes tariffs much differently, saying they are a penalty paid directly by the Chinese in a way that reaps billions of dollars in income for the U.S. Treasury. Even though the Chinese don't directly pay the tariffs, these penalties do drive up the costs of their products and make them less attractive to American consumers.\n\nTrump's National Economic Council director, Larry Kudlow, contradicted the president on Sunday, acknowledging that American consumers end up paying for the administration's tariffs on Chinese imports. \"Both sides will suffer on this,\" Kudlow said.\n\n[Kudlow acknowledges U.S. consumers, not China, pay for tariffs on imports]\n\nRepublicans for years have tried to lower tariffs to bring down costs for U.S. consumers and businesses, and some have continued to warn him that his steps might backfire.\n\nBut Trump has increasingly dismissed those concerns, arguing that his supporters believe he is fighting for them and won't punish him, according to administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the issue publicly.\n\nWhen the stock market slid leading up to Friday's deadline, White House aides said Trump complained but did not see a need for reversing course.\n\nAides said the moves this year, while stark, are a continuation of the approach he has taken since taking office. In 2017, he also withdrew from a climate agreement with other world leaders, withdrew from a nuclear deal with Iran and backed out of a broader trade agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In 2018, Trump announced he was moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, something the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations had refused to do.\n\nThis recent burst of executive action has had some limits. Trump tried to pressure Senate Republicans to confirm two political loyalists -- Herman Cain and Stephen Moore -- for the Federal Reserve Board, but he was rebuffed and both men had to withdraw from consideration. Similarly, Trump has tried to pressure foreign leaders from oil-producing countries to lower oil prices, but prices have ticked higher in recent months and raised costs for U.S. consumers. Last December, Trump ordered the withdrawal of about 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, then reversed course and decided to leave 400 troops in the country in the face of military concerns and criticism from Congress.\n\n[Stephen Moore, Trump's Federal Reserve choice, bows out amid scrutiny of past remarks about women, other topics]\n\nBut few issues have hamstrung Washington in recent decades as much as trade and immigration, and his actions this year could refocus attention on whether he is able to deliver on campaign promises in those areas.\n\nTrump's \"America First\" promise during the campaign resonated with many blue-collar voters in states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, and their support could prove crucial to his reelection chances next year. Many said they were willing to back a candidate who did things differently in a way that shook up Washington, even if that meant bypassing Congress.\n\n\"He sets aside political risk to do what he thinks is best for the country, because I don't think this is necessarily a popular political move,\" said Roy Bailey, who helped Trump during the 2016 campaign and is now finance chairman of the America First Action Super PAC. \"I think this is him putting the country first despite the politics of it, and that is the most refreshing thing for me.\"\n\nBut critics said Trump's recent actions are merely an extension of his freewheeling political and business career -- using short-term measures to address complicated issues that deserve more rigorous treatment.\n\n\"He prefers to try to govern by fiat instead of actually doing the hard work of building coalitions and making deals,\" said Chris Whipple, author of \"The Gatekeepers,\" a history of White House chiefs of staff. \"This was supposed to be 'The Art of the Deal,' and we're not seeing any dealmaking. We're seeing a guy who knows one thing, and that is campaigning.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RLA-45unt18tKf6LotFBCsMV3pA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J3POHVDUWUI6TM7VKZZ634WRE4.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4783551", "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 295400160}, {"uri": "1134310973", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-12", "time": "18:59:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-12T18:59:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5960784554481506, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/us/politics/larry-kudlow-trump-trade.html", "title": "Kudlow Breaks With Trump, Saying 'Both Sides Will Pay' in Trade War With China", "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump's chief economic adviser said on Sunday that American consumers would bear a burden from the escalating trade war with China, contradicting Mr. Trump's claim that his tariffs were a multibillion-dollar, one-way payment by China to the United States Treasury.\n\nThe adviser, Larry Kudlow, made his comments two days after negotiations for a trade deal with China broke off and Mr. Trump followed through on a threat to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese exports.\n\n\"In fact, both sides will pay,\" Mr. Kudlow said in an interview on Fox News. \"Both sides will pay in these things.\"\n\nMr. Kudlow's acknowledgment was merely a recognition of Economics 101. But it flew in the face of one of the president's favorite arguments: that trade wars are easy to win, and that the pain falls disproportionately on America's trading partners, which he accuses of having exploited the United States for years through predatory trade practices.\n\nAfter months of pressing urgently for a deal with China, Mr. Trump abruptly shifted course in the past week, stung by what he viewed as its attempt to renege on key parts of a draft agreement. The president declared he was ready to prolong the standoff with Beijing because the cost of a trade war is much higher for the Chinese, with their huge numbers of exports to the United States, than it is for Americans.\n\n\"Talks with China continue in a very congenial manner,\" Mr. Trump said Friday on Twitter. \"There is absolutely no need to rush -- as Tariffs are NOW being paid to the United States by China of 25% on 250 Billion Dollars worth of goods & products. These massive payments go directly to the Treasury of the U.S.\"\n\nHe went even further in a subsequent tweet, claiming that tariffs would \"bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind\" -- a statement that seemed to undercut his administration's contention that China has robbed American companies of billions of dollars through coercive practices like the forced transfer of technology and unfair licensing agreements.\n\nThere is no doubt that China is being buffeted by the tariffs, which could soon apply to virtually everything it exports to the United States. Mr. Kudlow said economic growth in China would slow down as its exports diminished. He argued that the effect on the American economy would be modest -- only a 0.2 percent reduction in growth -- even if Mr. Trump extended tariffs across the board, as he has threatened to do.\n\n\"You got to do what you got to do,\" Mr. Kudlow said. \"In my judgment, the economic consequences are so small but the possible improvement in trade, and exports, and open market for the United States -- this is worthwhile doing.\"\n\nThe Chinese government said on Sunday that the door to resolving the impasse was always open, but that it would not yield on matters of principle, according to state news media. There are no winners in a trade war, The People's Daily newspaper said in a commentary carried by the official Xinhua News Agency on Sunday. China does not want to fight, the newspaper said, but it is not afraid to do so.\n\nWhile economists differ on how much the trade war will crimp economic growth, most agree that the cost of tariffs is passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices on everything, including lighting fixtures and art supplies. Among the items covered by the administration's latest increase in tariffs to 25 percent: computers, toilet paper, dog collars, Christmas tree lights and mattress supports.\n\n\"Trump is dragging a dangerous misconception into a critical moment in his standoff with the Chinese,\" Chad Bown, an expert on trade at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said last week. \"And American businesses and consumers stand to pay the price.\"\n\nMr. Kudlow held open the prospect of progress: He said that Mr. Trump was likely to meet President Xi Jinping of China at the Group of 20 summit meeting next month in Osaka, Japan.\n\nIt was hard to tell if Mr. Trump's hard line was merely a negotiating tactic. But as the 2020 election campaign begins, he is showing clear signs that he views standing firm as a winning political strategy.\n\nAt a rally last week in Florida, he criticized the current Democratic front-runner, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., for being weak in his dealings with foreign leaders, and ridiculed the prospect of Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., negotiating with the Chinese president.\n\nFormer aides have also warned Mr. Trump against signing a watered-down agreement, saying that it could become fodder for Democrats, particularly progressives like Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, who has staked out a position on China trade as hawkish as that of Mr. Trump.\n\nFor his part, the president has argued that China's decision to pull back from an agreement last week reflected Beijing's calculation that it could extract a better deal from a Democratic president.\n\n\"I think that China felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election, 2020, to see if they could get lucky & have a Democrat win,\" Mr. Trump tweeted on Saturday, \"in which case they would continue to rip-off the USA for $500 Billion a year.\"\n\n\"The only problem,\" Mr. Trump added, \"is that they know I am going to win (best economy & employment numbers in U.S. history, & much more), and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term. Would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting BIG TARIFFS!\"\n\nThe daylight between Mr. Kudlow and his boss on tariffs is not unusual in this administration. There are also fissures between the president and his national security team on how to deal with adversaries like Iran and North Korea. But the resulting muddle in the administration's messages has fueled criticism from former officials that this White House does not have a coherent plan for dealing with China.\n\n\"The Chinese have an advantage because they have a strategy and we don't,\" Robert M. Gates, who served as defense secretary to Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said Sunday on the CBS News program \"Face the Nation.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_landler@nytimes.com", "name": "Mark Landler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/12/us/politics/12dc-trumptrade/merlin_154330416_a08b0a2e-ae27-4266-a8ea-1d408d25d222-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4783551", "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 295383540}, {"uri": "1133687142", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-11", "time": "17:22:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-11T17:22:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/world/asia/us-china-trade-war.html", "title": "Trade Standoff May Be Initial Skirmish in Broader U.S.-China Economic War", "body": "WASHINGTON -- A yearlong trade war between the United States and China is proving to be an initial skirmish in an economic conflict that may persist for decades, as both countries battle for global dominance, stature and wealth.\n\nProgress toward a trade agreement nearly collapsed this past week, with both sides hardening their bargaining positions. And even if a trade deal is reached, it may do little to resolve tensions between the world's two largest economies.\n\nThe United States is increasingly wary of China's emerging role in the global economy and the tactics it uses to get ahead, including state-sponsored hacking, acquisitions of high-tech companies in the United States and Europe, subsidies to crucial industries and discrimination against foreign companies.\n\nThe Trump administration has begun trying to limit China's economic influence in the United States and abroad, warning about China's ambitions in increasingly stark terms. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, compared China's ambitions to Russia and Iran in a speech in London last Wednesday, saying Beijing poses \"a new kind of challenge; an authoritarian regime that's integrated economically into the West in ways that the Soviet Union never was.\"\n\nThe United States has been erecting barriers to limit Chinese investment in American companies, re-examining the kinds of technology that can be exported to China and restricting China's role in building America's next-generation telecommunications networks, while also discouraging other countries from using Chinese equipment.\n\nThe F.B.I. has increased its scrutiny of Chinese researchers in the United States over fears they may be acquiring intellectual secrets. A Justice Department initiative is targeting commercial espionage of American technology, and earlier this year the United States unveiled a sweeping indictment of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, over accusations of stealing trade secrets and evading American sanctions on Iran.\n\nChina, whose ambition is to dominate industries of the future, is pushing back. A column on Saturday in the Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper stated, \"The United States is again waving the club of tariffs after misjudging China's strength, capacity and will, further escalating trade friction between our two countries.\"\n\nThe piece was written under the pen name Zhong Sheng -- the \"voice of China\" -- a name used when the paper publishes comments on foreign affairs that are authoritative.\n\nRestraining China's ambitions and methods is a tricky task -- and there is concern that the Trump administration's effort is creating a new red scare, fueling discrimination against China and its citizens that could ultimately hurt the United States. As many as 30 Chinese professors have had their visas to the United States canceled in the past year, or been put on administrative review, according to Chinese academics and their American counterparts.\n\n\"We've got decades of painful negotiating with China ahead,\" said David Lampton, a China scholar at Stanford University. Mr. Lampton said a trade deal, if reached, would do little to resolve the bigger conflict. \"It's just a skirmish in an ongoing battle.\"\n\nChinese negotiators returned to Beijing over the weekend without a trade agreement and with even larger economic barriers between the two countries. The Trump administration raised tariffs on $200 billion in exports on Friday and said it would move ahead with the legal process of taxing another roughly $300 billion of products at the same 25 percent rate.\n\nThe two countries could yet come to an agreement that opens opportunities for businesses and rolls back the levies they have placed on each other. Both American and Chinese officials said on Friday that they would continue to talk and could meet in Beijing next month. Liu He, China's vice premier, called the failure to reach a deal \"just a small setback in the talks between two countries,\" while Mr. Trump, in a tweet, described the talks as \"candid and constructive.\"\n\nWhile a trade deal could calm some tensions and establish more good will between the two nations, it is unlikely to achieve many of the ambitious goals that the administration has set for itself. Mr. Trump's advisers, in particular the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, have been focused on what the administration calls China's practices of \"economic aggression.\"\n\nBut the administration has struggled to address the immensity of the problems in the text of a trade deal. People close to the talks say that the negotiators appear powerless to force any changes that aren't in China's interest.\n\nMr. Liu, who is leading China's team in the trade negotiations, hinted at that uphill battle in a video statement released by the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n\"Now both sides have reached consensus in many respects, but frankly there are also areas of disagreement,\" he said. \"We believe that these are major matters of principle, and any country has its own important principles -- we can't make concessions on matters of principle.\"\n\nDespite punishing tariffs already on nearly half of Chinese exports to the United States, Beijing is still resisting many of the most significant changes that the administration seeks. It has been reluctant to roll back subsidies for advanced manufacturing industries or to make public commitments to stop cybertheft.\n\nInstead, a trade deal between the two countries seems more likely to bring change around the margins -- tens of billions of dollars of soybean purchases, some tariffs lifted and changes to the text of Chinese laws or regulations that the country might ultimately disregard, particularly once another administration occupies the White House.\n\n\"This is a decades-long endeavor,\" said Robert Daly, the director of the Wilson Center's Kissinger Institute on China and the United States. \"This can't be waved away over cake at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nThe notion that the United States has one last shot to change China's behavior is held by an array of people on both sides of the political spectrum. But it is an aggressive notion of American power to upend a rival system that has delivered prosperity for its people and put China on course to be the world's largest economy.\n\nMany in China see the United States as a declining power bent on enforcing its will on a world that no longer cowers before its hegemonic might. The troubles in American democracy and the long economic slump after 2008 persuaded many in China that its instincts to chart its own course were correct. In the eyes of many Chinese, their country is simply reclaiming its historic status as a dominant regional power in Asia.\n\nIt has also projected power across Asia, Africa and elsewhere while the United States has, on many fronts, retreated from its post-World War II commitment to the global order. But it has done so with little application of military force, in sharp contrast to what many in China see as American militarism.\n\nMany in China have sought to avoid a trade conflict, which could have a larger impact on their economy than the United States'. But they have long thought the United States would have a difficult time accepting a true peer in economic, technology and military power, so consider the management of conflict with the United States to be an inevitable result of their own rise.\n\nWhile the Trump administration accused China of breaking a trade deal, China's resistance to the emerging terms stemmed from its belief that the United States was asking too much and offering too little in return. Many of the changes the United States seeks would limit what Chinese officials regard as a tried-and-true approach of using tens of billions of dollars from state-owned banks and government investment funds to turn previously small industries like car production or solar panel manufacturing into the largest industries of their kind in the world.\n\nAnd the Chinese view some of the Trump administration's demands as infringing on their sovereignty and giving America too much power over their economy -- including requiring it to codify changes through legislation in the National People's Congress. To the increasingly nationalistic public in China, the American requests are reminiscent of 19th century history of unequal treaties forced on the country by foreign powers.\n\nIn the United States, China's unwillingness to bow to America's demands is uniting lawmakers like the Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.\n\nThat is a significant shift from the prevailing view in the United States since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 that close economic engagement with China would produce an increasingly democratic country that would be closely tied to an international economic order founded mainly on Western liberal ideals.\n\nThat has not happened.\n\nChina has indeed grown in prosperity, leaping into the ranks of what the World Bank defines as upper-middle income countries. Its economy is now bigger than any other country except the United States. Its manufacturing sector is now bigger than those of the United States, Germany and South Korea combined.\n\nBut in the last five years, China has veered toward increasingly repressive authoritarianism at home and a rapid military buildup. The State Department estimates that Beijing has put 800,000 to two million Muslims in hastily built internment camps ringed with barbed wire in northwestern China. The Chinese government has built an archipelago of air bases on artificial islands in the South China Sea in between Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. And China now has the world's largest navy and has conducted military exercises as far away as East Africa and the Baltic Sea.\n\nOn the economic front, the competition is even fiercer. Trump administration officials warn that China is trying to dominate the global 5G infrastructure that will be the basis for future mobile communications and is competing to set other technological standards that will determine which global companies win.\n\nChina is extending low-cost loans and building infrastructure around the globe through its One Belt, One Road program, which critics warn is making poorer countries beholden to China. It is out-investing the United States in some high-tech industries, and is gaining dominance in certain segments, like mobile payment, new energy vehicles and areas of artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile American companies have long hankered for access to China's growing market, their position has begun to shift as they see China's practices and treatment of foreign companies. A survey released by the American Chamber of Commerce in China in February showed that the majority of its members favored retaining tariffs on Chinese goods while trade negotiations continued.\n\nChina's own experts say that the Beijing leadership has been caught off guard by the pace of change in American perceptions of Sino-American relations.\n\n\"Even if there is some kind of agreement between Xi and Trump, in the long run the strategic bilateral relationship is already in trouble,\" said Zhang Jian, a professor in the School of Government at Peking University. \"There is no coming back, even if there is a deal.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/12/us/12dc-tradewar-sub-2/merlin_153827598_526c0d28-e557-4511-a8da-a90f4aa0af0b-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4782070", "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 295291320}, {"uri": "1133500178", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-11", "time": "10:55:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-11T10:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/opinion/killing-the-pax-americana.html", "title": "Opinion | Killing the Pax Americana", "body": "O.K., they weren't supposed to start the trade war until I got back from vacation. And I really have too many kilometers to cover and hills to climb to weigh in on a regular basis or at great length. But since I'm currently sitting in an outdoor caf\u00e9 with my coffee and croissant, I thought I might take a few minutes to address two misconceptions that, I believe, are coloring discussion of the trade conflict.\n\nBy the way, I don't mean Trump's misconceptions. As far as I can tell, he isn't getting a single thing about trade policy right. He doesn't know how tariffs work, or who pays them. He doesn't understand what bilateral trade imbalances mean, or what causes them. He has a zero-sum view of trade that flies in the face of everything we've learned over the past two centuries. And to the (small) extent that he is making any coherent demands on China, they're demands China can't/won't meet.\n\nBut Trump's critics, while vastly more accurate than he is, also, I think, get a few things wrong, or at least overstate some risks while understating others. On one side, the short-run costs of trade war tend to be overstated. On the other, the long-term consequences of what's happening are bigger than most people seem to realize.\n\nIn the short run, a tariff is a tax. Period. The macroeconomic consequences of a tariff should therefore be seen as comparable to the macroeconomic consequences of any tax increase. True, this tax increase is more regressive than, say, a tax on high incomes, or a wealth tax. This means that it falls on people who will be forced to cut their spending, and is therefore likely to have a bigger negative bang per buck than the positive bang for buck from the 2017 tax cut. But we're still talking, at least so far, about a tax hike that is only a fraction of a percent of GDP.\n\nThis means that it's hard to justify claims that the trade war, at least what's currently in the pipeline, will cause a global recession.\n\nIf the trade war expands not just to all imports from China but to imports from Europe and other parts of the world, we could get this up to a contractionary fiscal policy of a couple of points of GDP; $200 billion here, $200 billion there, and soon you're talking about real money. And that certainly could happen: Trump imagines that he's winning, and might well move on from China to European cars and so on. But we're not there yet.\n\nBut doesn't the prospect of foreign retaliation change the picture? Actually, what foreign retaliation does is prevent tariffs from being less bad than an ordinary tax increase. When a large country like the U.S. imposes tariffs, one effect - if we don't face foreign retaliation - is a rise in the price of U.S. exports, either though a rise in the dollar or by drawing resources away from export to import-competing sectors. This price rise is, other things equal, a gain for America (although not for export-oriented sectors like agriculture.) And this \"terms of trade\" effect can mitigate or even reverse the overall losses as tariffs distort the economy.\n\nIf (when) foreigners retaliate, however, the terms of trade effect goes away, and we're back to tariffs just being a tax on domestic consumers.\n\nMaybe the larger point here is that there tends to be a certain amount of mysticism about trade policy, because the fact that it's global and touches on one of the most famous insights in economics, the theory of comparative advantage, gives it an amount of mind space somewhat disproportionate to its actual economic importance. Yes, trade policy is important; but in terms of the strict economics it's not more important than health policy, or fiscal policy, or policy in general.\n\nI say this, by the way, as someone whose career as a professional economist was based mainly on research into international trade and finance. In general, people who actually work on these issues tend to assign them less importance than those who haven't studied them closely.\n\nAll of this, however, is only about the strict economics of a trade war, which may be the least important aspect of what's happening.\n\nFor trade policy isn't just about economics. It's also about democracy and peace.\n\nThis is obvious and explicit in Europe, where the origins of the European Union lie in the Coal and Steel Community of the early 1950s - an agreement whose economic benefits, while real, were in a way incidental to its real purpose, preventing any future wars between France and Germany. And membership of the E.U. has always been contingent on democratization - which is, by the way, why the E.U.'s limp reaction to the de facto collapse of democracy in Hungary and, it appears, Poland represents such moral failure.\n\nIt's more implicit in the case of the United States. But the historical record is pretty clear: the postwar trading system grew out of the vision of Cordell Hull, FDR's Secretary of State, who saw commercial links between nations as a way to promote peace. That system, with its multilateral agreements and rules to limit unilateral action, was from the beginning a crucial piece of the Pax Americana. It was as integral to the postwar order as the IMF, which was supposed to provide a safety net for nations having balance of payments trouble, or for that matter NATO.\n\nAnd Trump's trade war should correspondingly be seen as part and parcel of his embrace of foreign dictators, lack of respect for our allies, and evident contempt for democracy, at home as well as abroad.\n\nBut wait, you say: China is neither an ally nor a democracy, and it is in many ways a bad actor in world trade. Isn't there a reasonable case for confronting China over its economic practices?\n\nYes, there is - or there would be if the tariffs on Chinese products were an isolated story, or better yet if Trump were assembling an alliance of nations to confront objectionable Chinese policies. But in fact Trump has been waging trade war against almost everyone, although at lower intensity. When you're imposing tariffs on imports of Canadian steel, on the ludicrous pretense that they endanger national security, and are threatening to do the same to German autos, you're not building a strategic coalition to deal with a misbehaving China.\n\nWhat you're doing, instead, is tearing down what's left of the Pax Americana.\n\nWasn't this inevitable in any case? I don't think so. True, U.S. economic dominance has been eroding over time, not because we're getting poorer, but because the rest of the world is getting richer. But there was reason to hope that a relatively peaceable international order could be sustained by an alliance of democratic powers. In fact, until a few years ago it seemed to me that we were seeing exactly that taking place for the world trading system, which was transitioning from largely benign U.S. hegemony to a comparably benign co-dominion by the U.S. and the E.U.\n\nAt this point, however, things look a lot bleaker. It's not just Trump. And it's not even just Trump plus Brexit. The Europeans are also turning out to be a big disappointment. As I said, if they can't even deal with the likes of Viktor Orban within their own community, they're definitely not up to providing the kind of leadership the world needs.\n\nBut where the Europeans are weak, Trump is malign. He's working actively to make the world a more dangerous, less democratic place, with trade war just one manifestation of that drive. And the eventual negative consequences for America and the world will be much bigger than anything we can capture with economic modeling of the effects of tariffs.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Lyric Li May 11 at 6:21 AM\n\nBEIJING -- China will not flinch in the face of American pressure to agree to a trade deal, Beijing's chief negotiator said after the latest round of talks ended without agreement and higher tariffs were imposed on Chinese exports.\n\nLiu He, China's vice premier, tried to strike a resolute but relatively conciliatory note as he left Washington following the end of the fractious talks.\n\n\"It is like a marathon: the last phase can be the hardest,\" Liu told Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV after the trade talks. \"To sit out the dark before the dawn, we have to hang in there, and we hope we get the understanding and support of all aspects.\"\n\nChina was firmly opposed to a trade war but would keep a cool head while trying to resolve it, he said. \"China is not flinching, and nor are the Chinese people.\"\n\nLiu arrived in Washington on Thursday for talks just a few hours before the Trump administration increased tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods had increased from 10 percent to 25 percent.\n\nTalks on Thursday night and Friday failed to break the deadlock over President Trump's insistence that Beijing agree to make structural reforms to its economy in additional to buying more American goods to redress the trade imbalance between the world's two biggest economies.\n\nTwo-way trade between the countries totals more than $660 billion a year, but most of that is Chinese exports to the U.S. China ran a trade surplus of close to $420 billion with the U.S. last year.\n\n[Trump's tariffs, once described as negotiating tools, may be here to stay ]\n\nThe two sides appeared close to reaching an agreement last month, with Trump saying they were on the brink of an \"epic\" deal. But that spectacularly fell through after meetings in Beijing two weeks ago, after which Trump accused China of reneging on its agreements and threatened to increase the tariffs he had imposed last year in an effort to show Beijing he was serious.\n\nTrump made good on that threat at 12:01 a.m. on Friday D.C. time. China responded two minutes later saying it had no choice but to take \"countermeasures.\" But the authorities in Beijing have not released any details, leading analysts to think they are biding their time in the hope an agreement can be reached before the tariffs kick in.\n\nThe tariffs do not apply to goods in transit, only to those shipped after the tariffs were increased. That gives the two sides about two weeks before ships leaving China arrive on the United States' west coast.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pronounced the latest discussions \"constructive\" but did not provide any further details.\n\nLiu said China wanted the U.S. to roll back the new tariffs. \"China believes that it was the tariffs that started all the trade frictions, and in order for us to reach an agreement, all [punitive] tariffs should be retracted,\" he told Phoenix.\n\nBut he also revealed that the two sides were deadlocked over both the reforms that China should carry out and the amount of additional American products China should be buying to narrow their trade imbalance.\n\n\"On the issue of purchases, the state leaders of China and the U.S. reached a consensus during their meeting in Argentina and had a preliminary agreement on the numbers,\" Liu said. \"But the two sides are now disagreeing on how big the number should be. For China, we think this is a very serious issue and cannot compromise on it easily.\"\n\n[There are three ways the U.S.-China trade war could end. Two would be bad for America. ]\n\nThe Trump administration had also wanted China to commit to changing laws as part of its commitment to step up intellectual property protections and stop forcing American companies to share their technological secrets, accusing Beijing of trying to water down previously agreed provisions for this.\n\n\"China is not regressing or reneging; we are only addressing divergences in some of the text and we want them resolved. Therefore, we don't think it necessary to overreact on this issue,\" Liu said.\n\nBeijing authorities also tried to strike a careful note in a commentary published Saturday, but warned that there would be no quick solution to the trade war.\n\n\"We have to realize that the 'fighting while talking' scenario will probably come to stay throughout the U.S.-China trade negotiations, and we will have to adapt to that,\" said the commentary carried on Taoran Notes, a social media site which Beijing has increasingly been using to manage domestic expectations on the trade war.\n\n\"The negotiation is not breaking down, instead, it is having an interlude as the two sides are unable to resolve their differences in a short time,\" Taoran Notes said on Saturday.\n\n\"A major rift between the U.S. and China is that they see 'fairness' differently. When one side only recognizes its own demands and tries to force the other to succumb with extreme measures, disregard of 'fairness' of the talks, then it is not unlikely that the two countries would part on bad terms,\" said the post, published after Liu's departure.\n\nWhile it was possible there would be an \"explosion of frictions and conflicts\" between China and the U.S., Taoran Notes said the two countries were capable of blazing a new trail: \"One that manages to keep disagreement under control while helping the two get along by giving consideration to the greatest common factor between their respective interests.\"\n\nThe revived trade war could have a significant impact on the global economy, said Mei Xinyu, a researcher at the Commerce Ministry's International Trade and Economic Cooperation Institute.\n\n\"No matter how cocky Trump is, he will run into a stone wall,\" Mei said. \"Looking from the market situation, the tariffs Trump imposed [on Chinese goods] will eventually come through in wholesale and retail prices in the United States.\"\n\nAs the world's two largest economies, accounting for about 40 percent of global output, that would have long-term, knock-on effects, Mei said. \"This is life and death for the entire international trading system.\"\n\nRead more\n\nTrump's explanation of the trade fight with China is wrong in a remarkable number of ways\n\nProspects for trade deal suddenly darken as China looks for a way to save face\n\nTrump doubles tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports, escalating U.S.-China trade war", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AzMJnz7XNBVFu_9MkvQQLu2tkG0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MI4Y5NDT2YI6THVUBAUPKOEQCM.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4781728", "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 295266660}, {"uri": "1133282756", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-11", "time": "02:18:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-11T02:18:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/05/10/there-are-three-ways-us-china-trade-war-could-end-two-would-be-bad-america/", "title": "Analysis | There are three ways the U.S.-China trade war could end.

(Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images) By Heather Long Heather Long Economics correspondent May 10 at 1:52 PM\n\nPresident Trump is trying to achieve a massive trade deal with China, something no other president has been able to do. It was always going to be tough. A week ago, a deal appeared close. Now prospects seem bleak.\n\nTrump massively escalated the trade war Friday by hiking tariffs on many Chinese imports. The president now has 25 percent tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese products. (While he likes to claim China pays that bill, the truth is U.S. consumers pay it.) The stock market has shed about 2 percent, and China's top trade negotiator is leaving Washington with no deal, as his country prepares to strike back.\n\nNegotiations are almost always messy, but this is starting to look like mud wrestling in a hurricane. The key question that everyone from the trading floors of Wall Street to the Iowa soybean farms is asking is: How does this end?\n\n[U.S.-China trade talks end for the day with no announcement of a deal]\n\n\"I have no idea what's going to happen,\" Trump said Thursday. Realistically, there are three potential paths this U.S.-China trade war could take. Trump is either going to get a good deal, a lousy deal or no deal. Two of those options aren't great for the American people, especially if Trump leaves all the tariffs in place. Here's a rundown.\n\n1) Trump gets a \"good deal.\" It's subjective what would constitute a good deal, but most economists, trade negotiators and business leaders say it means China would agree to enhanced protections for intellectual property and open up the Chinese market more to U.S. businesses. Ideally, trade experts say there would also be an enforcement mechanism to ensure China follows through on its promises.\n\nRecall that a year ago the Chinese tried to buy off Trump by offering to purchase billions more of U.S. natural gas, soybeans and other agricultural products. It's a move that would probably shrink the trade deficit a bit (which Trump tweets about frequently), but it wouldn't fundamentally alter the U.S.-China trade relationship. Trump said no to that deal, so the pressure is on for him to get a lot more from the Chinese than what was on the table last year.\n\n\"China had hoped to keep it to a shopping list. They thought because the president is preoccupied with the bilateral trade deficit that if they could demonstrate to him they would buy a trillion more of this or a trillion more of that, he might buy it,\" said Michael Froman, former U.S. trade representative under President Barack Obama. \"The administration thus far has said they are not going to stop there.\"\n\nSome on Wall Street still think this scenario can happen, which helps explain why the market isn't down more this week. It would also be a major talking point for Trump's reelection campaign. But investors, business leaders and the Chinese also want to see the tariffs removed after a deal is reached. If the tariffs remain, it could still be a drag on the economy in the critical 2020 election year.\n\n2) No deal is reached. A full-blown trade war ensues. This is most economists' worst-case scenario. The two sides do not reach an agreement and Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping continue to ramp up tariffs and barriers on trade, which could even spill over to other parts of the world. It's basically a trade version of the Cold War, and the economic consequences would likely be severe.\n\n\"A trade war, with across-the-board tariffs on US-China trade, would push the global economy towards recession,\" wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists in a note to clients Friday.\n\nThe Tax Foundation, which typically leans to the right, said Friday that the tariffs already in place amount to $72 billion worth of new taxes on Americans. If Trump puts even more tariffs, as he has threatened, growth would fall by 0.75 percent, \"effectively offsetting almost one-half of the long-run impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\" and employment would fall by more than 580,000 jobs, the Tax Foundation forecasts.\n\nThe economy is doing pretty well and many in Washington wonder why Trump would risk this scenario, which could cost him the election and bring on a recession.\n\n3) Trump gets a lousy deal and many tariffs stay. The easiest deal to strike is the one China already put on the table: The Chinese agree to buy more U.S. goods. But after almost a year of Trump's tariffs and a lot of pain for farmers, a deal like that would likely be a letdown.\n\nIt's the deal that could have happened a year ago, and it's doesn't give U.S. companies greater access to the Chinese market, which is the real prize for years to come as that country's middle class grows. (Chinese consumers are already buying as much per year in total as Americans and those numbers are only expected to grow).\n\nThe core of what American companies want in an agreement is \"substantive, legally-binding changes to Chinese policies,\" said the U.S.-China Business Council. \"Our members want an agreement that includes measurable, commercially meaningful outcomes.\"\n\nWhile the markets would likely be relieved just to have an agreement done, Democrats would pounce on Trump for being a weak negotiator, and U.S. businesses would still be at a disadvantage in China. Leaving all the cuurent tariffs in place would only add to the pain.\n\nRelated:\n\nTrump defiant as trade penalties kick in, warns China there is more to come\n\nThe big problem in the U.S.-China trade negotiations: History\n\nIs this economy too good to be true?", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5NMDAkZk0mT6cUlnGqvMd1jHoC8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6N4U7WDTEAI6TEZRGC6FQNXURY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4779749", "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 295237080}, {"uri": "1133269687", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-11", "time": "01:41:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-11T01:41:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/us/politics/trump-china-trade-2020-election.html", "title": "Trump Sees a China Trade Deal Through a New Prism: The 2020 Election", "body": "WASHINGTON -- When President Trump had finished mocking the field of Democratic presidential candidates at a rally in Florida this week (\"Sleepy Joe,\" \"Crazy Bernie\" and \"Boot-edge-edge\"), he pivoted abruptly to his intensifying trade war with China. The segue was no accident: Mr. Trump is determined to present himself as tougher on the Chinese than any of his potential challengers in 2020.\n\n\"Representing us against President Xi of China?\" a sarcastic Mr. Trump said of Pete Buttigieg, the young mayor of South Bend, Ind. \"That'd be great.\" Taking aim at former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. earlier in the day, he said that China had pulled back from a trade deal because it wanted to wait him out and negotiate with a President Biden or \"one of the very weak Democrats, and thereby continue to rip off the United States.\"\n\nElection-year politics have crept into Mr. Trump's trade policy.\n\nFor months, the prospect of a landmark trade agreement with China has tantalized Mr. Trump. But now, according to analysts and several former aides, his political calculus seems to have flipped. His recent statements suggest he now believes that demonstrating his toughness with the Chinese and walking away from a deal might well put him in a better position politically than signing one.\n\nImposing new tariffs on China is likely to hurt American farmers, rattle the stock market and possibly damage the economy. But signing an agreement could expose Mr. Trump to attacks by Democrats, particularly if it is perceived as weak. A hard line, on the other hand, would allow the president to cater to his political base while heading off any Democratic attempts to outflank him as the great protector of American workers.\n\n\"The days of being soft on China are over,\" said Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist for Mr. Trump, who shaped the economic message of his 2016 campaign and has warned repeatedly about the dangers posed by China. \"Politics now drives the economics.\"\n\nBashing China is a well-worn election-year tactic for both Democrats and Republicans. But Mr. Trump has upended the usual practice by pursuing actions against China that are every bit as aggressive as his campaign messaging. His protectionist instincts defy mainstream Republican orthodoxy and align him more with progressives like Senators Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, and Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts.\n\nMr. Sanders has vowed to label China a currency manipulator -- something Mr. Trump had promised to do during his campaign but was talked out of by advisers. And he has criticized Mr. Biden for voting for permanent normal trade relations with China and for saying, during a recent campaign stop in Iowa: \"China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man.\"\n\n\"It's wrong to pretend that China isn't one of our major economic competitors,\" Mr. Sanders said in a tweet. \"When we are in the White House, we will win that competition by fixing our trade policies.\"\n\nSeveral of Mr. Trump's current and former aides -- including Mr. Bannon and Peter Navarro, his trade adviser -- have long argued that being tough with China and never accepting a deal is the right course. They were countered by more mainstream figures like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, the president's chief economic adviser, who warned Mr. Trump that a prolonged trade war would buffet both the economy and financial markets.\n\nIn recent weeks, however, Mr. Trump's campaign advisers have also started to echo the no-compromise approach, according to a former official. That, combined with Mr. Biden's potential political weakness on China, has shifted Mr. Trump's thinking away from those who urged a deal.\n\nAt his rally this week in Panama City, Fla., Mr. Trump claimed that Mr. Biden was telling supporters that foreign leaders told him they hoped he would defeat Mr. Trump in 2020. \"Of course they do,\" the president told his crowd, \"so they can continue to rip off the United States.\"\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the decision on whether to abandon trade talks with China will hinge on more than politics. Trade is one of the few issues where he has deeply rooted ideological convictions, dating back to the 1980s. Mr. Trump views his aggressive tactics with Beijing as a way to break a pattern of Chinese dissembling that he contends has characterized China's negotiations with the last three American presidents.\n\nFrom the earliest days of Mr. Trump's presidency, he has viewed a deal as a major political victory and made it one of his top priorities.\n\nBy the beginning of this year, he had grown impatient with the pace of negotiations and began pressing his advisers for a deal. In February, as negotiators were still early in the process of drawing up a text, he broached the idea of a \"signing summit\" with President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, his club in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nMr. Trump's eagerness for a deal encouraged Mr. Mnuchin and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, to give him overly optimistic reports about their progress, according to a person familiar with the talks, to avoid both his anger and an impulsive tweet or statement that might complicate the talks.\n\nLast Friday evening, after yet another visit by Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Lighthizer to Beijing, the Chinese sent the Americans a diplomatic cable containing a heavily redacted version of the text that the two sides had been working on, with modifications to all seven chapters of the 150-page document. Among other things, the changes walked back commitments to codify some parts of the agreement in Chinese law.\n\nThe administration's hawks saw the changes as proof that China never intended to keep its promises, and the revisions seem to have given Mr. Trump a genuine change of heart that he expressed repeatedly this week.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Trump fired off a pair of tweets criticizing the Chinese and pledging to increase tariffs, and by Friday he had increased the tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent. And he said he would start a process to levy a 25 percent tariff on virtually every other Chinese export.\n\nIt is not clear whether Mr. Trump has reverted from the eager deal maker to the anti-China hawkishness of the 2016 campaign. The risks of an all-out trade war are considerable. Political analysts said voters were likely to judge the president's actions by how they affected their economic fortunes, not by whether he looked tougher than the Democrats. To some extent, that is true even of Mr. Trump's supporters.\n\n\"They have been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt because he is addressing the issue,\" said David Winston, a strategist who advises Republicans. \"Their attitude is, 'We're with you in wanting to do this, but ultimately, it's got to produce a positive impact for the country.'\"\n\nYet there are also political risks for Mr. Trump in agreeing to a deal, particularly if he ends up with an agreement that has the same lack of teeth as those of his predecessors. Democratic candidates would most likely pounce on that as evidence that Mr. Trump's blustering style does not produce results.\n\n\"A weak deal, including one that does not stop cybertheft by China, will be another proof point for Democrats to say that at the end of the day, Trump just doesn't get the job done,\" said Geoff Garin, a veteran Democratic pollster.\n\nMr. Garin said his firm had conducted research for Democrats that showed undecided and independent voters were troubled by the decline in the income of farmers because of Chinese retaliation for Mr. Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"The China trade situation is particularly important because it ties his impulsive and erratic nature to real-world consequence for Americans, in terms of leaving many workers and farmers worse off than before,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_landler@nytimes.com", "name": "Mark Landler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/10/reader-center/10dc-trumpchina-sub/10dc-trumpchina-sub-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4779264", "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 295234860}, {"uri": "1133239581", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-11", "time": "00:19:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-11T00:19:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6392157077789307, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trumps-tariffs-once-described-as-negotiating-tools-may-be-here-to-stay/2019/05/10/8a55b69e-735d-11e9-8be0-ca575670e91c_story.html", "title": "Trump's tariffs, once described as negotiating tools, may be here to stay", "body": "By David J. Lynch and David J. Lynch Financial writer covering trade and globalization Heather Long Heather Long Economics correspondent May 10 at 7:42 PM\n\nThe failure of the United States and China to reach agreement Friday on a comprehensive trade deal raises the risk that President Trump's favorite negotiating tool -- high tariffs on imported goods -- may be hardening into a permanent feature of the U.S. economy.\n\nTwo days of talks ended Friday with no sign of the agreement that both governments once had predicted would be achieved by this point. After parting company with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pronounced the latest discussions \"constructive\" but declined to elaborate.\n\nLess than 12 hours earlier, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods had increased to 25 percent from 10 percent, in a sign of the president's waning patience with the negotiations.\n\nTrump, who has started the process of imposing tariffs on all remaining U.S. imports of Chinese goods, also issued a flurry of tweets embracing tariffs as his preferred economic policy and hinting that the China levies might linger.\n\n\"The relationship between President Xi and myself remains a very strong one, and conversations .\u2009.\u2009. into the future will continue. In the meantime, the United States has imposed Tariffs on China, which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations!\" the president tweeted.\n\nTrump's enthusiasm for tariffs has been no secret since his calls during his presidential campaign for a 45 percent tariff on everything Americans buy from China. But his focus on tariffs is a striking departure from the policies pursued by his Democratic and Republican predecessors -- especially if he proceeds with his threat to apply tariffs to all $540 billion of annual U.S. purchases from China.\n\nA shipping container is offloaded from the CSCL East China Sea container ship in Oakland, Calif., in June 2018. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\n\"Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind,\" he said in an earlier tweet, adding that raising taxes on imports was \"much easier and quicker to do.\"\n\n[Analysis | Trump's explanation of the trade fight with China is wrong in a remarkable number of ways]\n\nSince launching his tariff wars in January 2018 with a levy on washing machines, Trump has wielded his tariff club over solar panels and industrial metals, and in a bid for new trading arrangements with China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union.\n\nNone of the tariffs that the president has imposed have been removed.\n\nTrump's refusal to lift tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from Mexico and Canada has sparked a revolt among Senate Republicans, who are refusing to approve his new North American trade deal until he lifts those tariffs.\n\nOpposition has been especially pronounced among senators representing farm states that have been hurt by Mexico's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products.\n\nAlong with more tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump also is considering raising import taxes on automobiles and a variety of products from the E.U. Completing the administrative process involved in levying tariffs on the remaining Chinese goods could take months.\n\nBut the president is drawing closer to a choice between a major escalation of his tariff campaign -- one that risks enormous economic and political fallout -- and a disappointing outcome at the bargaining table.\n\n\"We're in a very different spot than we were just a week ago,\" said Carla Hills, who was a U.S. trade representative under President George H.W. Bush. \"Tariffs are not a good trade negotiating tool.\"\n\nThe president's claim that the tariff bill is paid by countries on whose products levies are imposed has been criticized by economists associated with both parties. Several studies have shown that the financial impact of the U.S. tariffs imposed over the past year has fallen almost entirely on American consumers and businesses.\n\n\"Raising tariffs will be disastrous. The tariffs already in place have cost the American technology sector about $1 billion more a month since October,\" said Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Technology Association. \"That can be life or death for small businesses and start-ups that can't absorb the added costs.\"\n\nTrump's promise to overhaul U.S. trade agreements was a major element in his appeal to voters in industrial states in the Midwest, which suffered major job losses that many voters blame on unfair foreign competition.\n\nThe president's most recent tariff moves against China have pushed what is known as \"the weighted-average applied U.S. tariff rate\" -- once among the lowest in the world -- to just over 4 percent, higher than the Chinese, Russian and Turkish figures, according to Deutsche Bank.\n\nTrump's muscular approach cheered his protectionist supporters. \"While Pres. #Trump placed tariffs on China, r econ has boomed: 3.6% unemployment rate, 3.2% inc in avg hourly earnings, & GDP +3.2%,\" tweeted Dan DiMicco, a former chief executive of the steel company Nucor.\n\nTrump, who monitors the stock market and economic data closely, regards a strong economy as a key selling point for his reelection. The president's hard-line stance this week helped to rebut criticism that he \"sold out cheaply\" to China, said one veteran trade lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to comment freely.\n\nAdministration officials, too, link the president's protectionist stance to the economy's surprisingly robust growth. \"There's no question that some of the trade policies helped in the GDP number,\" Mnuchin told reporters Monday.\n\nFor the president, the danger is that the economy's current strength could ebb. Activity in the manufacturing sector, which has prospered under Trump, is slowing from last summer's peak. In April, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey fell to its lowest point since October 2016.\n\n\"The latest escalation in trade negotiations with China threatens to exacerbate the slowdown. Threats have been made, and if tariffs are increased it will kick a sector that is already on the decline,\" Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists wrote in a research note Friday.\n\n[Analysis | There are three ways the U.S.-China trade war could end. Two would be bad for America.]\n\nCompanies now must plan for tariffs that persist for months or years. In the crosshairs: retailers that typically import holiday merchandise over the summer, and energy and auto companies that fear losing additional sales in China and the ability to ship U.S.-built cars there.\n\n\"Trump certainly says that tariffs are a good outcome for the country, which is nuts for U.S. consumers,\" said Michael Smart, a managing director at Washington-based Rock Creek Global Advisors and a former international trade counsel to the Senate Finance Committee. \"If I'm a business person and I've got customers or operations in China, I have to assume at least the current level of tariffs will be in place indefinitely.\"\n\nSmaller and midsize companies, meanwhile, are even harder-hit because they cannot absorb the higher costs as easily and do not have the scale to negotiate with alternative suppliers in places such as Vietnam, Taiwan or Mexico.\n\nClifton Broumand, the owner of Man & Machine, in Landover, Md., once hosted former president George W. Bush on a visit to promote made-in-America manufacturing.\n\nNow, the keyboard and computer products maker is eyeing a move abroad to escape tariffs on some of the parts his company gets from China.\n\n\"If Trump goes the whole way and puts tariffs on all Chinese imports, I wouldn't be able to bring anything into our country to sell around the world. I'd have to manufacture in China. Does that make any sense? Not to me,\" said Broumand. \"I agree with Trump that we need to go after China, but I just think his method is totally wrong.\"\n\nFor nearly a century, American presidents have worked to reduce federal taxes on imported goods so that consumers could enjoy less-expensive products and manufacturers could benefit from cheaper parts.\n\nSpurred by the role that high tariffs played in exacerbating the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which inaugurated the effort to reduce trade barriers, according to Dartmouth College economics professor Douglas Irwin, the author of a definitive history of U.S. trade policy.\n\nIf the president does tax all imports from China, the move would be a historic shift.\n\n\"Where we are is worse than where we were a week ago,\" said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The tariffs are clearly going to be around for longer than we thought and at a higher level than we thought.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/o1td02jZxkgpoYJQ7quJRHP56Mc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KJUACQTTM4I6TC7AZJLVM4HJDQ.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4779749", "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 295229940}, {"uri": "1133170657", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-10", "time": "21:36:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-10T21:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5529412031173706, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/05/10/us-markets-slide-following-tariff-increase-trade-talks/", "title": "Dow claws out of 359-point hole to end a wild week sparked by U.S.-China trade standoff", "body": "The momentum shifts after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called negotiations 'constructive'\n\nTraders work after the opening bell Friday at the New York Stock Exchange.

The close left the Dow at a 114-point gain, or about 0.44 percent. Leading the Dow were Walmart, Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola. The blue chips were down 2.12 percent on the week.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index also finished to the upside Friday after diving early in the day. The S&P finished at 2,881, up 0.37 percent. All 11 S&P sectors showed gains Friday, with utilities, consumer discretionary and real estate leading the way. The S&P lost 2.18 percent for the week, its worst week of the year.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite crawled back into the black as well, finishing at 7,917, six points above where it started the day.\n\nThe indexes are still close to their all-time highs May 3, and the returns remain strong so far for 2019. For this year, the Dow is up 11.4 percent, the S&P 500 up more than 15 percent and the Nasdaq ahead 19.7 percent.\n\nThe threat of higher tariffs, which took effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday, has sown unrest in global markets all week as investors and business executives try to parse the uncertainty and brace for what's to come. Fears of the looming tariffs showed in many China-exposed companies Thursday, with Apple, Boeing and Caterpillar falling roughly 1 percent.\n\n\"You have this nervousness going into the weekend,\" said Kenny Polcari of ButcherJoseph Asset Management. \"The market has come under pressure over the last week and was down 3.5 percent for the week, then it turned around and took Trump's saying the the talks did not break down as positive news. It's still tenuous and not done yet, but the market took that as a good sign and it bounced back.\"\n\nThe U.S.-Chinese trade negotiations wrapped up before noon and the Chinese were preparing to leave. But U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the talks were \"constructive,\" leaving the possibility of a deal to be done.\n\nThe market began a choppy U-turn characterized by stops, starts and reversals throughout the afternoon.\n\n\"Investors are starting to fear that trade wars aren't as easy to win as the president has been declaring,\" said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. \"Administration officials had been raising expectations of a deal by now. Instead, they've raised tariffs on Chinese imports again with the prospect of prolonged negotiations and more tariffs if no progress is made soon.\"\n\nInternational markets seemed to stabilize during the day Friday while Chinese stock markets, after suffering big losses earlier in the week, gained. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 3.1 percent, and the Shenzhen Component Index gained 4 percent.\n\nAfter closing in the red Thursday, European markets rebounded across the board Friday. France's CAC 40 was up 0.5 percent in morning trading. Germany's DAX was up 0.8 percent, and England's FTSE 100 had climbed 0.4 percent.\n\nAfter Trump expressed frustration with the pace of trade talks and threatened to impose steep tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports last weekend, negotiators failed to reach a deal this week. U.S. officials accused China of going back on prior details of the deal; China denied this. Trump's chief trade negotiator, Robert E. Lighthizer, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are expected to meet with China's vice premier, Liu He, on Friday to continue negotiations.\n\nThursday, the Commerce Ministry said China \"deeply regrets\" the decision to increase the tariffs and \"will have to take necessary countermeasures.\"\n\n\"We hope that the U.S. and China will meet each other halfway and make joint efforts to solve the existing problems through cooperation and consultation,\" a spokesman said in a statement.\n\nInvestors seem exasperated by the back-and-forth, and said it is hurting the U.S. economy.\n\n\"We've seen this throughout the trade war - - negative headlines, algorithms drive stocks down. I don't like it, no investor likes it,\" said Nancy Tengler of Tengler Wealth Management. \"The risks are rising that the tariffs and, more importantly, the uncertainty among business leaders, will stall out both economies and consequently global growth. We still believe there will be a resolution. But the risks are rising. \"\n\nTrump defended the tariffs in tweets Friday morning, signaling that he would be willing to enact even steeper penalties in the future. In one of the tweets, Trump wrote that there was \"no need to rush.\" He claimed that the tariffs would \"bring in far more wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of a traditional kind.\" He also repeatedly warned China not to renegotiate the terms of the deal.\n\nBut trade experts and business groups have said Trump routinely misstates how tariffs work. Tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. companies -- such as manufacturers and chemical producers -- that bring in products from overseas. Though this drives up the price of Chinese products, which Trump contends is good for U.S. competitors, it also pushes up costs for U.S. companies and, ultimately, consumers.\n\nBeyond the trade hubbub, investors were watching for Uber's highly anticipated initial public offering Friday, with the ride-hailing giant pricing at $45 a share, lower than the company initially indicated.

(Jim Watson/AFP) By Catherine Rampell Catherine Rampell Columnist covering economics, public policy, politics and culture Columnist May 10 at 10:11 AM\n\nAt 12:01 a.m. Friday, President Trump's two worst economic ideas finally collided -- and made each other even worse.\n\nTo be sure, there are a lot of terrible economic theories espoused by this president (tax cuts pay for themselves, government shutdowns are fun, scam artists should roam free, etc.). But the specific bad ideas I'm referring to are:\n\nTrade wars are good and easy to win; and It's smart for the president to publicly bash the Federal Reserve.\n\nLast fall, Trump began loudly complaining about the Fed's interest rate hikes, in defiance of a multidecade-long policy for the White House to never comment on Fed decisions. The reason for this norm is clear: Central banks must be politically independent in both practice and perception in order to credibly commit to stable prices. If the public believes that politicians rather than independent technocrats control the printing press, inflation can easily spiral out of control. Lots of other countries throughout history (Venezuela, Argentina, pre-euro Italy) have served as cautionary tales.\n\nBut none of that mattered to Trump. He has been throwing tantrums about the Fed's modest interest rate increases, claiming that they threaten both the U.S. economy and his presidency. At one point, there were even reports that Trump was considering taking the unprecedented and cataclysmic step of firing the Fed chair whom he appointed, Jerome H. Powell.\n\nMarkets paid attention. As it turns out, China did, too.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Beijing noticed Trump's latest Fed-related outbursts and interpreted them as evidence that the president was freaked out about the underlying health of the U.S. economy. They suggested that he might be secretly desperate to make a deal, any deal, with China:\n\nMr. Trump's hectoring of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates was seen in Beijing as evidence that the president thought the U.S. economy was more fragile than he claimed ...\n\nAn April 30 tweet, in which Mr. Trump coupled criticism of Mr. Powell with praise of Chinese economic policy, especially caught the eye of senior officials. \"China is adding great stimulus to its economy while at the same time keeping interest rates low,\" Mr. Trump tweeted. \"Our Federal Reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates.\"\n\n\"Why would you be constantly asking the Fed to lower rates if your economy is not turning weak,\" said Mei Xinyu, an analyst at a think tank affiliated with China's Commerce Ministry. If the U.S.'s resolve was weakening, the thinking in Beijing went, the U.S. would be more willing to cut a deal, even if Beijing hardened its positions.\n\nIn other words, our dealmaker in chief failed to realize that berating the Fed not only harms the long-run credibility of the central bank; it also hurt his near-term negotiating position with China.\n\nAfter previously expressing a willingness to make serious concessions, China started playing hardball. Negotiations broke down, and then Trump responded by more than doubling existing tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports, from 10 percent to 25 percent, on Friday. He has also threatened to add tariffs to an additional $325 billion in Chinese goods that aren't currently taxed.\n\nTrump seems to believe that these tariffs are an end unto themselves because they are bringing \"wealth\" into the country by forcing China to pay \"billions\" into the U.S. Treasury:\n\nThis is, to be clear, incorrect.\n\nTwo separate studies by separate teams of all-star economists have found that 100 percent of the tariffs Trump has imposed so far are being passed along to, and paid by, U.S. consumers. One of those studies also found that workers in heavily Republican counties were being hurt the most by Trump's trade wars, thanks to both the tariffs the president has imposed on our imports and the tit-for-tat retaliation other countries have slapped on our exports.\n\nIn other words, Trump's Fed war has worsened his trade war. And in a particularly painful, the trade war might also soon heighten his Fed war.\n\nAfter all, worsening trade tensions could put the Fed in a bind. An escalation in tariffs is likely to increase uncertainty, slow down business investment and hiring, and ultimately drag on growth. But it might also raise prices, since as those studies I cited note, the cost of the tariffs so far has been passed through to U.S. consumers.\n\nThat first effect -- slowing growth -- would nudge the Fed toward looser monetary policy. The second effect -- higher inflation -- could instead nudge the Fed toward tighter monetary policy. If a spike in inflation is clearly from a transitory shock (such as a one-time increase in tariffs), Fed officials should ignore it; but even so, it might be hard to tell in the moment what's behind any given change in the pace of price growth.\n\nPowell acknowledged these challenges when asked by Marketplace's Kai Ryssdal last year about the tools available if trade wars slow the economy:\n\nPowell: ... We essentially have our our interest rate tool, so if the economy weakens, we can lower interest rates. We can slow the pace at which we're increasing them. There could be an effect on inflation. I wouldn't want to, you know, dive into a bunch of hypotheticals here, but I would say, you can imagine situations which would be very challenging, where inflation is going up and the economy is weakening.\n\nRyssdal: And you're lowering rates all the same, just waiting for stuff to get better.\n\nPowell: Again, it's not at all clear how it would evolve. Inflation could move up, just sort of a step up in the price level, which wouldn't affect future inflation, and that would be something you tend to look through what we call a supply shock. But this will, it it'll have to be a question that we think about. But again I don't want to get into a lot of hypotheticals. I just think at this point we're watching carefully and hoping for a good result.\n\nBasically, escalating trade tensions could make the central bank's already very difficult job even more difficult -- and thereby provide even more fodder for Trump to complain about Fed policies.\n\nThe moral of the story: Neither trade wars nor Fed wars are good and easy to win. But especially not when fought simultaneously.\n\nThe Post's View: Trump's biggest mistake in the trade war with China\n\nSteve Bannon: We're in an economic war with China.

Lighthizer told reporters was \"unacceptable.\" Chinese officials have denied backing away from any commitments.\n\nThe chain of events that began with higher tariffs and continued through Trump's tweets have sown unrest in financial markets around the world and have left investors and business executives unsure of what is to come. Trump in the past has threatened severe penalties only to back down days later, but he has also shown a willingness to dig in and trust his instincts, even if advisers have warned against it. He believes the strength of the economy gives him leverage to use aggressive trade tactics.\n\n\"At this stage, it is difficult to envision this as a bluff anymore,\" said Eswar Prasad, a senior professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \"He seems deadly serious about taking on China in a broad economic confrontation irrespective of the consequences to the U.S. economy.\"\n\nThe new tariffs largely impact business equipment, but will also affect $40 billion in consumer products like air conditioners, furniture, certain clothing and spark plugs. The financial impact of the tariffs could be delayed because it will only apply to products that left China on Friday, which often take two or three weeks to arrive from Shanghai. But business often pass these costs on to consumers, which could drive up prices across the country.\n\nLighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are expected to meet with China's vice premier, Liu He, on Friday to continue negotiations. They met Thursday and were unable to avert the imposition of higher tariffs. But Trump's tweets Friday could be interpreted as a signal to the Chinese that he will not back down.\n\nIn one of the tweets, Trump wrote that there was \"no need to rush.\" He claimed that the tariffs would \"bring in far more wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of a traditional kind.\" He also connected his approach with that of former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for president and wants to challenge Trump in the 2020 election. Biden's quick rise to the top of many polls in the Democratic primary has drawn the attention of top White House officials.\n\nBut trade experts and business groups have said Trump routinely misstates how tariffs work. Tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. companies that bring in products from overseas. So those costs are borne by companies like manufacturing firms, chemical producers, and others that rely on Chinese products. This drives up the cost of Chinese products, which Trump has said will help U.S. competitors, but it also pushes up the cost for U.S. companies that use Chinese products as well.\n\nIn another tweet, Trump said he was preparing to impose a 25 percent tariff on the remaining $325 billion in Chinese imports that have so far not been impacted. This is considered to be one of the most extreme penalties he has left to unload, and it could impact products purchased by virtually every American, including electronics, other clothing, and car parts, among other things.\n\nTrump has for years complained that the U.S. buys more goods from China than China does from the U.S., referring to a trade imbalance that is unfair to U.S. workers and companies. Many companies, Democrats, and Republicans have agreed that China uses unfair trade practices to gain an advantage and hurt U.S. companies, but they have disagreed with his tactics of using tariffs to punish the Chinese. Trump has said the easiest solution would be for companies to move their factories back to the U.S. and make their products here instead of importing them, a change that would help U.S. workers.\n\nBut critics have said this vision of the economy is dated and doesn't take into account the global forces that have shifted production all over the world in the past 40 years.\n\nThursday, the Commerce Ministry said China \"deeply regrets\" the decision to increase the tariffs and \"will have to take necessary countermeasures.\"\n\n\"We hope that the U.S. and China will meet each other halfway and make joint efforts to solve the existing problems through cooperation and consultation,\" a spokesman said in a statement.\n\nChinese officials, however, did not say what precisely they would do in response. Some U.S. companies and farmers have said they are being caught in the crossfire of the trade war. China, for example, has halted much of its purchase of U.S. soybeans, leading soybean prices to plunge and putting many U.S. farmers on the brink of bankruptcy. China could decide to further restrict purchases of U.S. products, raise tariffs on U.S. goods, or take other steps.\n\nTrump has been under pressure from farmers to back down on his trade threats, and he appeared to nod to those concerns on Friday. He claimed that the U.S. would use the money generated by the tariffs to purchase products from American farmers and \"ship it to poor & starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance.\" It's unclear how this would work, whether it would be legal, or what farmers would benefit. It could take an act of Congress, and Trump has so far tried to enact his protectionist trade agenda against China, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and the European Union without any interference from lawmakers.\n\nChinese stock markets, after suffering big losses earlier in the week, actually gained on Friday. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 3.1 percent and the Shenzhen Component Index gained 4 percent.\n\nThe stock market opened a bit down following Trump's tweets, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping around 90 points in early morning trading.

May 10 at 7:09 AM\n\nBEIJING -- China is digging in for a new battle in its trade war with the United States, declaring Friday that it has no choice but to \"take necessary countermeasures\" against increased tariffs on its goods.\n\nThe declaration was posted on the Chinese Commerce Ministry's website at 12:03 p.m. Beijing time -- exactly two minutes after the United States raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10 to 25 percent as President Trump had threatened. The two sides will meet again Friday morning in Washington, but many economists and other experts see little prospect of a breakthrough any time soon.\n\n\"The level of antagonism and distrust between the U.S. and China, which has culminated in an all-out trade war, makes it difficult to envision a path out of the quagmire the two sides are now in,\" said Eswar Prasad, former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division.\n\nThe escalation could hardly have come at a worse time for President Xi Jinping and his ruling Communist Party.\n\nHe will now have to find a way to forge a deal with the United States that he can sell as a victory at home -- at the same time as the party steels itself for June 4, the 30th anniversary of the protests that began in Tiananmen Square and left thousands dead across the country.\n\n\"The weeks ahead of us are very crucial. We have to pass that sensitive date,\" said one Chinese observer with close links to decision-makers in the party. \"Nothing can go wrong, there can be no bad news,\" he said on condition of anonymity to discuss delicate internal deliberations.\n\nNerves are running so high that party organs are constantly being told to \"guard against color revolutions,\" the observer said, referring to the popular uprisings that toppled leaders in former Soviet states including Georgia and Ukraine. \"Everything is related to China's internal politics,\" he said.\n\n[Trump doubles tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports, escalating U.S.-China trade war ]\n\nIn the middle of this tense environment comes the surprise escalation in the trade war -- one that Trump has blamed on the Chinese side for seeking to revise key parts of their 150-page agreement at what was supposed to be the 11th hour.\n\nIn all seven chapters of the draft deal, China had deleted its commitments to change laws to address U.S. concerns, Reuters reported. These included the theft of U.S. intellectual property and trade secrets, forced technology transfers, competition policy, access to financial services, and currency manipulation.\n\nThat prompted Trump to publicly threaten on Twitter on Sunday to raise the tariffs.\n\n\"What I'm seeing is a couple blinded by anger, fighting and pouring toxic words on one another: One side is threatening tariff hikes and the other talks about countermeasures,\" said Chen Fengying, a senior researcher at the China National Association for International Studies. \"After what Trump has said, it would be unlikely for China to sit back and accept the humiliation,\" she said.\n\nTrump's tweets caused China's leaders to gather at Zhongnanhai, the Communist Party headquarters in Beijing, on Monday to discuss whether Liu He, the vice president and lead negotiator, should still go to Washington this week. He did, having dinner with his counterparts just hours before the tariffs went up to 25 percent.\n\nLiu would not have made the trip if China didn't want to find a way to reach a deal, Chen said.\n\nThe two sides are scheduled to resume talks Friday morning, but there is little optimism about them.\n\n\"I don't see a short term resolution in the making,\" said Paul Haenle, a former China director on the National Security Council who now runs the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing.\n\n\"It's now become much more complicated to cut a deal because Trump has put a spotlight on all the things that the Chinese are most reluctant to give up,\" he said, citing intellectual property rights and forcing companies that operate in China to hand over their technology secrets.\n\nThe higher tariffs apply only to goods that leave China from Friday onward, not to shipments already on their way to the United States. That gives the two sides a couple of weeks to work out a deal before tariffs actually take effect -- although that puts the agreement even closer to the June 4 anniversary of the 1989 protests.\n\n[With one eye on the past, Trump and Xi look to future of U.S.-China trade ]\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry said China \"deeply regrets\" the U.S. decision to increase the tariffs. But it did not go into details about the countermeasures it would impose, triggering speculation that it was not ready.\n\nChinese stock markets, after suffering big losses earlier in the week, actually gained on Friday. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 3.1 percent and the Shenzhen Component Index gained 4 percent.\n\nThe prospect of higher tariffs is already concerning some exporters. \"Although sales to the U.S. make up only 10 percent of the total, I am worried,\" said July Lee, the owner of a factory in Shenzhen that makes LED-illuminated makeup mirrors. \"We will still suffer some losses,\" she said.\n\nAnalysts are now waiting to see if Trump slaps duties on the remaining $325 billion worth of \"untaxed\" goods that China sends to the United States. That could make the trade war sufficiently painful to China to trigger compromise -- or to the United States, where consumers would face higher prices for goods like electronics.\n\nSome experts are concerned that the trade war will inflict significant direct and collateral damage on both sides, although this may not immediately be apparent given that the U.S. economy is performing well and the Chinese economy has not slowed down as quickly as expected.\n\n\"A deeper concern is that the trade war could morph into broader open economic warfare, affecting all aspects of the economic relationship between the two countries,\" said Prasad, who now teaches at Cornell University. \"Investment flows, business relationships, and even flows of tourists and students between the two countries could be adversely affected.\"\n\nLyric Li, Liu Yang and Wang Yuan contributed reporting.\n\nTrade war threatens to roil 2020 race as Republicans complain about the tariffs Trump loves\n\nTrump's washing-machine tariffs cost U.S. consumers $815,000 for every job created\n\nThe worst justification for Trump's battle with China?

More than four-fifths of his orders come from the United States.\n\nThe trade war, now nearly a year old, has already squeezed Mr. Chen's bottom line. American customers insisted that he lower his prices so they wouldn't have to raise theirs. When he contemplates moving production out of China -- to Southeast Asia, for instance -- he worries about losing access to China's vast supply chain and capable work force.\n\n\"This is totally a lose-lose situation,\" Mr. Chen said. \"We lose profits and have to shut down. American importers cannot find effective alternatives that can deliver products with the same quality.\"\n\nThe Chinese government issued a muted response on Friday after President Trump raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. China's Ministry of Commerce vowed to retaliate, although it did not say how or when. Still, global financial markets -- which have been hit by trade tensions in recent days -- rose in hopes of an eventual deal.\n\nChina's heavily controlled news media have been walking a careful line, calling for defiance but not more dramatic action, such as a boycott of American products.\n\nBefore Friday's tariff increase, multiple state media outlets had published a cryptic, anonymously written article with the headline, \"If You Want to Talk, We Can Talk. If You Want to Fight, We'll Fight.\" The article presented China as a calm, neutral presence upon which American policies had, very regrettably, exerted pressure.\n\nChinese people are polite by nature, the article said, yet unafraid of confrontation. \"We are prepared to fight back,\" it said.\n\nThe question for Chinese leaders is how long the higher tariffs will last. China has ways to keep its economy humming, at least in the near term. Negotiators also have time to reach a deal, as the Trump administration effectively delayed the tariff increase by saying they only applied to goods that leave China on Friday or later. Oceangoing goods, in other words, won't get hit by the 25 percent levy until they arrive at American ports over the next few weeks.\n\nStill, China's economy has shown it isn't invulnerable. Some factories are already suffering.\n\n\"You can definitely feel the anxiety,\" said Lu Mengxi, the founder of a winery in northwestern China that sells both domestically and abroad, including in the United States.\n\nWhat began last year as an investigation into China's practices toward American companies operating within its borders has turned into a sprawling conflict that has weighed on financial markets and economic activity across the globe.\n\nWhile analysts widely believe the two countries will eventually reach a deal to avert a trade dispute that could seriously hurt the world economy, the appetite for further conflict seems unabated on both sides.\n\nAmerican companies operating in China have generally chided both countries' governments for using tariffs to bring each other to the negotiating table. On Friday, however, Ker Gibbs, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, sounded more favorably inclined toward the Trump administration's policies and less tolerant of Beijing's.\n\n\"While many of our companies are hurt by the tariffs and ongoing trade tensions, we understand the U.S. government's frustration,\" Mr. Gibbs said in a statement. \"There needs to be a deal that rebalances the economic relationship.\"\n\nFew in China appear to believe that a change of tactics is due, either.\n\n\"It would be easy to do what a small minority of people in China are advocating, and to go along with America on everything,\" Hu Xijin, editor in chief of the state-run newspaper Global Times, wrote in a commentary on Friday. \"But that just won't do. That would not be responsible to the people's interests.\"\n\n\"The trade negotiations have gone on for so long because the two countries' fundamental interests cannot be reconciled,\" Nicole Zhang, 26, an employee at an online travel company, said while shopping in a Beijing mall on Friday. \"National interests are unfeeling things like that. That's just how it is.\"\n\nAt the beginning of the year, China's position was more defensive. Its economic growth slowed in the second half of last year, in part because tariffs hurt business confidence. Since then, the Chinese government has poured billions of dollars into the financial system and pressed state-run banks into service extending credit.\n\nOfficials said last month that the economy grew 6.4 percent in the first quarter of the year, matching the pace from the previous quarter. Industrial output has been solid. Shoppers have opened their wallets.\n\nStill, for many Chinese businesses, especially those that sell overseas, uncertainty remains front of mind. China's exports to all major regions, not only to the United States, grew more slowly in the beginning of this year. Should the trade war intensify further, China may find it increasingly expensive to prop up its economy, and it could face another slowdown or widespread job losses.\n\nThe state news media have worked to reassure the country's consumers. In a headline published on Friday before the tariffs rose, the People's Daily newspaper, which is the Communist Party's mouthpiece, declared that Chinese trade \"has positive momentum and strong driving power.\"\n\nSome companies with business on both sides of the Pacific are trying to stay positive, too. N\u00e9e Lau, the owner of Amourvino Winery in Napa, Calif., said the tariffs China imposed last year had hurt his profits. Still, Mr. Lau said he would rather not raise prices, even if it meant earning less for now. Holding onto his overseas dealers and clients, he said, is more important to the long-term health of his business.\n\n\"The United States and China will definitely come to some kind of agreement. It's just a matter of time,\" Mr. Lau said. \"It's impossible for a war between two superpowers to go on forever.\"\n\nJason Wang, who owns a shoemaker in Fujian Province that sells to the American market, says that what frustrates him is that the tariff negotiations are taking place at a far remove from the people, like him, who are most directly affected.\n\nMr. Wang also lamented the nationalist sentiment on both sides that he felt had egged on the two countries' leaders. Americans, he said, probably felt that their country was taking a strong stance by imposing tariffs.\n\n\"And when China fights back, many praise the government for being tough,\" he said.\n\n\"But I think no one actually wins in the end,\" Mr. Wang said. \"Ordinary people on both sides are paying the price.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "raymond_zhong@nytimes.com", "name": "Raymond Zhong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/10/world/10chinareax-1/10chinareax-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4779749", "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 295182240}, {"uri": "1132735021", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-10", "time": "10:42:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-10T10:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/powerup/2019/05/10/powerup-mcconnell-holds-reins-in-gop-s-don-jr-fight/5cd47fa11ad2e544f001dc9f/", "title": "Analysis | Power Up: McConnell holds reins in GOP's Don Jr. fight", "body": "It's Friday, Power players.

John Cornyn (R-Tex.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and others up for reelection in 2020 -- who are likely to rely on help from the president on the campaign trail and the surrogacy of his son -- released public expressions of support for the Trump family and told reporters they disagreed with Burr.\n\nDespite the mounting pressure and scrutiny, Burr has not backed down from his decision, privately defending his \"reasoning behind the subpoena, according to people familiar with the discussion -- including the timeline of the negotiations with Trump Jr. over his repeat testimony,\" my colleagues Seung Min Kim and Karoun Demirjian report.\n\nAllies of Burr told Power Up they don't expect the independent-minded senator to bend:\n\nA source with direct knowledge confirmed to Power Up that McConnell defended Burr's decision to issue a subpoena during a closed-door GOP lunch on Thursday. Publicly, the GOP leader spent the week pushing the line \"case closed\" with regards Mueller's investigation (not to mention placing an op-ed defending Trump in his favorite newspaper: The New York Post).\n\nGOP strategists and Senate staffers viewed McConnell's \"case closed\" rhetoric as a deliberate decision to lay down a marker in an effort to move people off the topic.\n\nU.S. ESCALATES TRADE WAR at 12:01 a.m.: \"The United States and China hurtled toward a defining moment in their four-decade-old, with financial markets bracing for the outcome of unusually dramatic trade talks in Washington,\" our colleagues David J.

Six of them resigned on a single day last month. The reason? They are feeling persecuted for publishing reports that shed an unflattering light on Trump policies.\n\nBut these reports are just reflecting reality (which has a well-known anti-Trump bias). Rural America is a key part of Donald Trump's base. In fact, rural areas are the only parts of the country in which Trump has a net positive approval rating. But they're also the biggest losers under his policies.\n\nWhat, after all, is Trumpism? In 2016 Trump pretended to be a different kind of Republican, but in practice almost all of his economic agenda has been G.O.P. standard: big tax cuts for corporations and the rich while hacking away at the social safety net. The one big break from orthodoxy has been his protectionism, his eagerness to start trade wars.\n\nAnd all of these policies disproportionately hurt farm country.\n\nThe Trump tax cut largely passes farmers by, because they aren't corporations and few of them are rich. One of the studies by Agriculture Department economists that raised Trumpian ire showed that to the extent that farmers saw tax reductions, most of the benefits went to the richest 10 percent, while poor farmers actually saw a slight tax increase.\n\n[For an even deeper look at what's on Paul Krugman's mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]\n\nAt the same time, the assault on the safety net is especially harmful to rural America, which relies heavily on safety-net programs. Of the 100 counties with the highest percentage of their population receiving food stamps, 85 are rural, and most of the rest are in small metropolitan areas. The expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which Trump keeps trying to kill, had its biggest positive impact on rural areas.\n\nAnd these programs are crucial to rural Americans even if they don't personally receive government aid. Safety-net programs bring purchasing power, which helps create rural jobs. Medicaid is also a key factor keeping rural hospitals alive; without it, access to health care would be severely curtailed for rural Americans in general.\n\nWhat about protectionism? The U.S. farm sector is hugely dependent on access to world markets, much more so than the economy as a whole. American soybean growers export half of what they produce; wheat farmers export 46 percent of their crop. China, in particular, has become a key market for U.S. farm products. That's why Trump's recent rage-tweeting over trade, which raised the prospect of an expanded trade war, sent grain markets to a 42-year low.\n\nIt's important to realize, by the way, that the threat to farmers isn't just about possible foreign retaliation to Trump's tariffs. One fundamental principle in international economics is that in the long run, taxes on imports end up being taxes on exports as well, usually because they lead to a higher dollar. If the world descends into trade war, U.S. imports and exports will both shrink -- and farmers, among our most important exporters, will be the biggest losers.\n\nWhy, then, do rural areas support Trump? A lot of it has to do with cultural factors. In particular, rural voters are far more hostile to immigrants than urban voters -- especially in communities where there are few immigrants to be found. Lack of familiarity apparently breeds contempt.\n\nRural voters also feel disrespected by coastal elites, and Trump has managed to channel their anger. No doubt many rural voters, if they happened to read this column, would react with rage, not at Trump, but at me: \"So you think we're stupid!\"\n\nBut support for Trump might nonetheless start to crack if rural voters realized how much they are being hurt by his policies. What's a Trumpist to do?\n\nOne answer is to repeat zombie lies. A few weeks ago Trump told a cheering rally that his cuts in the estate tax have helped farmers. This claim is, however, totally false; PolitiFact rated it \"pants on fire.\" The reality is that in 2017 only about 80 farms and closely held businesses -- that's right, 80 -- paid any estate tax at all. Tales of family farms broken up to pay estate tax are pure fiction.\n\nAnother answer is to try to suppress the truth. Hence the persecution of Agriculture Department economists who were just trying to do their jobs.\n\nThe thing is, the assault on truth will have consequences that go beyond politics. Agriculture's Economic Research Service isn't supposed to be a cheering section for whoever is in power. As its mission statement says, its role is to conduct \"high-quality, objective economic research to inform and enhance public and private decision making.\" And that's not an idle boast: Along with the Federal Reserve, the research service is a prime example of how good economics can serve clear practical purposes.\n\nNow, however, the service's ability to do its job is being rapidly degraded, because the Trump administration doesn't believe in fact-based policy. Basically, it doesn't believe in facts, period. Everything is political.\n\nAnd who will pay the price for this degradation? Rural Americans.

Let's see if we can get something done.\"\n\nRobert E. Lighthizer, the chief U.S. trade negotiator, is scheduled to meet at 5 p.m. Thursday with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He to continue negotiations aimed at a comprehensive deal.\n\n[With one eye on the past, Trump and Xi look to future of U.S.-China trade]\n\nThose talks had been proceeding smoothly, with U.S. officials predicting a final accord could be agreed to as soon as this week.\n\nBut China last weekend angered the president by trying to water down its commitments, according to Lighthizer. Chinese officials balked at specifying in the agreement which laws would be amended to address U.S. concerns over forced technology transfer and intellectual property protection, U.S. officials said.\n\n\"The vice premier is coming here today. We were getting very close to a deal, and then they started to renegotiate the deal. We can't have that,\" the president said, following a White House event on preventing surprise medical bills. \"It was their idea to come back.\"\n\nTrump said he expected \"a very strong day\" at the negotiating table, but added \"our alternative is an excellent one,\" an apparent reference to the tariff increase.\n\nChina has vowed to retaliate \"in kind\" if the president proceeds with the increase to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion in Chinese products.\n\nAlong with the increase scheduled for Friday, the president has also threatened to extend tariffs to all $540 billion in annual Chinese imports.\n\n[Until Trump's trade war is over, it's probably best if you don't look at your 401(k)]\n\nThe president frequently boasts about the revenue the federal government receives from higher tariffs, a tax increase that is paid by U.S. importers.\n\nThough most economists say such a broadening of the trade conflict would inflict serious damage on both economies, the president insists his tariffs helped the U.S. economy grow at a 3.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter.\n\n\"I'm different than a lot of people .\u2009.\u2009.

(Korean Central News Agency/Getty Images/AFP) (Kcna Via Kns/AFP/Getty Images) By Jennifer Rubin Jennifer Rubin Opinion writer covering politics and policy, foreign and domestic Opinion writer May 9 at 1:30 PM\n\nThe Post reports:\n\nPresident Trump is questioning his administration's aggressive strategy in Venezuela following the failure of a U.S.-backed effort to oust President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, complaining he was misled about how easy it would be to replace the socialist strongman with a young opposition figure, according to administration officials and White House advisers.\n\nThe president's dissatisfaction has crystallized around national security adviser John Bolton and what Trump has groused is an interventionist stance at odds with his view that the United States should stay out of foreign quagmires.\n\nIt's odd that Trump doesn't understand why his own policy is so aggressive; he and his vice president have issued numerous blustery pronouncements and threats. Perhaps Bolton's mistake was in taking Trump's commitment to the opposition too seriously. Alternatively, Trump may have been duped by an overly optimistic national security adviser who had no plan B if Maduro didn't give up.\n\nThen there are then the trade negotiations with China. What seemed like a narrowing of differences now appears to be a potential collapse of talks, with Trump threatening that higher tariffs will be imposed Friday. The Wall Street Journal reports, \"The new hard line taken by China in trade talks -- surprising the White House and threatening to derail negotiations -- came after Beijing interpreted recent statements and actions by President Trump as a sign the U.S. was ready to make concessions, said people familiar with the thinking of the Chinese side.\" Apparently Trump's weakness or apparent weakness -- the sort of negotiating behavior he'd scorned in \"The Art of the Deal,\" a fictional account of his career -- has brought us to the brink of an even more dangerous trade war.\n\nAs with Venezuela, Trump would like to blame others (even Democrats, somehow), but his own attempts to flatter Chinese President Xi Jinping and his attacks on the head of the Federal Reserve seem responsible for China's about-face:\n\nTrump's hectoring of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates was seen in Beijing as evidence that the president thought the U.S. economy was more fragile than he claimed.\n\nBeijing was further encouraged by Trump's frequent claim of friendship with Chinese President Xi Jinping and by Trump's praise for Chinese Vice Premier Liu He for pledging to buy more U.S. soybeans.\n\nThat brings us to North Korea, which after two ill-advised summits has resumed missile testing and failed to demonstrate it is serious about denuclearization, no matter how many times Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tries to spin the results.\n\nSome common themes characterize these and other foreign policy flubs.\n\nFirst, Trump imagines all foreign leaders are narcissistic patsies like he is. He tries to flatter those immune to flattery. He ignores egregious human rights behavior in North Korea and China for fear of poisoning a personal relationship that exists only in his head. Strongmen, as a result, see him as gullible and weak.\n\nThat leads to Trump's second major failing: He gives too much away for free without any demand for reciprocity, thereby emboldening opponents. He gives Kim Jong Un passive PR wins. He lets China's ZTE off the hook and slow-walks sanctions against China. He gives Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman a free pass on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, with no promise of any changed behavior domestically or in Yemen.\n\nThird, Trump and his advisers set unrealistic goals, reinforce them with exaggerated rhetoric and then lack a backup plan. Whether it is Venezuela or Iran, he envisions regime change but lacks a viable road to achieving such a dramatic result. As a result, friends and foes no longer take him seriously.\n\nFourth, he mistakes gestures for policy. Pulling out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a.k.a. the Iran deal, doesn't make us safer. Pulling out of the Paris accord doesn't create an alternative plan for fighting climate change. Agreeing to move our embassy to Jerusalem doesn't bring us an inch closer to a deal, even an intermediary one, between Israel and the Palestinians. The administration and Trump in particular never seem to be prepared to answer the logical question \"And then what?\" In fact, these are moves for domestic policy consumption and without an overarching strategy to achieve desired results. In addition, they fray relationships with allies who are essential to our long-term interests.\n\nFinally, under two secretaries, the State Department has been hollowed out and left with absent or \"acting\" officials, in addition to facing massive proposed budget cuts, which Congress has fortunately rejected. A demoralized, disrespected State Department bleeding away officials with decades of experience is no way to beef up American influence and stature.\n\nIn sum, Trump has gotten by in life with lies, bluster and secrecy (e.g., keeping his tax returns under wraps). He hires flunkies, not experts in their field who might challenge his views. The results aren't pretty. Moreover, unlike his financial foul-ups, Trump's foreign policy mistakes will have real, long-term consequences for American security and prosperity.\n\nMax Boot: Trump again shows how easily he's manipulated by dictators\n\nThe Post's View: The problem with Trump's 'help wanted' administration\n\nJennifer Rubin: Six ways Democrats can zap Trump on foreign policy\n\nJackson Diehl: For a man who considers himself to be a dealmaker, Trump is avoiding a lot of deals\n\nFareed Zakaria: Does a Trump doctrine on foreign policy exist?

Lynch David J. Lynch Financial writer covering trade and globalization May 9 at 7:00 AM\n\nWhen U.S. and Chinese negotiators resume trade talks Thursday evening, they will try to recast their economic relationship for the future. But the biggest obstacle to success may be their rival understandings of the past.\n\nThe Trump administration looks at the past 20 years of agreements with China as an unbroken record of cheating and broken promises. To avoid a repeat performance, Robert E. Lighthizer, the president's chief trade negotiator, is determined to craft an accord replete with iron requirements China must implement.\n\nYet China's history as the victim of what its officials call \"unequal treaties\" from the 19th century makes Beijing reluctant to accept terms that might be seen at home as foreign dictates.\n\n[Trade war threatens to roil 2020 race as Republicans complain about the tariffs Trump loves]\n\nTrump has tried to reassure China by stating publicly that his goal is not to prevent its rise and that he blames his American predecessors, rather than Beijing, for the chronic U.S. trade deficit, according to an individual close to the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity to explain internal deliberations.\n\nThese competing historical narratives are shaping negotiators' strategies and explain why -- after anticipating an agreement as soon as the end of this week -- the two sides instead find themselves deadlocked.\n\nPresident Trump plans to more than double tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods at 12:01 a.m. Friday in response to what U.S. officials say was Chinese backsliding on a tentative agreement.\n\nChina on Wednesday vowed to respond \"in kind\" if the president proceeds.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He is expected to meet Lighthizer on Thursday, just hours before the higher levies kick in. The Chinese delegation is \"coming to the U.S. to make a deal,\" Trump tweeted. \"We'll see.\"\n\nLighthizer said earlier this week that Chinese negotiators were seeking \"substantial\" changes in an agreed text he and Liu had negotiated \"line by line.\"\n\nThe revisions included core provisions specifying which Chinese laws would be amended to prevent the forced technology-transfer practices that ignited the tariff war more than a year ago.\n\nSome analysts warn Trump's latest threats -- which include placing tariffs on all $540 billion in annual Chinese imports -- risk backing Chinese President Xi Jinping into a corner.\n\n\"If the choice is between tariffs and surrendering to Trump on U.S. terms, then China will opt for the tariffs,\" said Michael Hirson, who leads the Eurasia Group's coverage of China.\n\nFrom the outset of the trade dispute, which centers on China's technology-acquisition policies, Trump administration officials have been determined to avoid what they see as the mistakes of the past.\n\n[African swine fever has crept from China to Europe. Will it hit the U.S.?]\n\nPrevious U.S. presidents from both parties entered into dialogues and agreements with China without permanently resolving issues of trade-secrets theft and forced technology transfer, the administration said.\n\nSince 2010, Chinese officials, including Xi, made 10 specific commitments to address U.S. complaints about trade-secrets theft and forced technology transfer, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\nIn 2016, during Barack Obama's final visit to China as president, Xi pledged not to require the transfer of intellectual property rights or technology as a condition of doing business in China.\n\nU.S. officials say they must have more than promises this time. Lighthizer has pushed an enforcement system giving the U.S. the right to impose tariffs if it decides that China is not living up to the deal -- with China barred from responding in kind.\n\n\"We've had these conversations with China for years. If you don't have specific commitments, backed up with enforcement, you don't have anything,\" said Clete Willems, a former senior White House trade official, who starts as a partner at Akin Gump next month.\n\nChinese diplomats feel equally strongly about not letting the United States dictate terms. Their sensitivity has its origins in the treaties that Western powers, including the United States, forced a feeble Qing Dynasty to accept following the First Opium War in the 1840s.\n\nIn China's recounting, the accords compelled China to open its ports to foreign goods, beginning a \"century of humiliation\" that ended only with Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949.\n\nTrade talks with the United States come just days after China marked the 100th anniversary of its May Fourth Movement, commemorating student protests over the Chinese government's weak response to the provisions of the Paris Peace Conference that ended World War I. Under that agreement, Germany's colonial concessions in China were transferred to other foreign powers without Chinese leaders having any say in the matter.\n\n[Trump administration accuses Chinese officials of 'reneging' on commitments in trade talks]\n\nTrump has tried to mollify Chinese concerns about foreign bullying by taking steps to prevent the trade pact from appearing one-sided. The United States would be bound by the same intellectual property, technology-transfer and open-investment provisions as China, said the individual close to the talks.\n\nAaron L. Friedberg, a China expert at Princeton University who served as an adviser to former vice president Richard B. Cheney, said there are limits to history's hold on the Chinese government.\n\n\"They use the 'century of humiliation' and all the bad things that foreigners have done to them as a tool that serves multiple purposes,\" he said, including as a shield against legitimate foreign demands.\n\nMore recent experience may also explain negotiators' inability thus far to strike a bargain.\n\nFor 40 years, U.S. leaders have prioritized deepening economic ties between the two countries rather than confront China over its trade practices.\n\nThe recent backsliding that irked Trump may indicate that Beijing has misread him and expects the unconventional U.S. leader to make the same choice, Friedberg said.\n\n\"They may have trouble imagining this relationship could fundamentally break down and look very different than it does now,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qaCbi_N_DiFPScUwIhX90l6fD3o=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/R4TXCLDRDAI6THYGL7BO5AACPI.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4770178", "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 295109820}, {"uri": "1132033569", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-09", "time": "14:40:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-09T14:40:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/us/politics/china-trade-tariffs.html", "title": "China 'Broke the Deal' on Trade, and Trump's Retaliation Starts Friday", "body": "WASHINGTON -- A pivotal round of trade talks between the United States and China gets underway on Thursday but American businesses are bracing for higher tariffs on Chinese imports as a quick resolution to resolve a yearlong trade war becomes increasingly unlikely.\n\nJust a week ago, Wall Street and the nation's largest industry lobbying groups were hopeful that the world's two largest economies were on the cusp of securing a historic trade treaty. But President Trump's anger at China for backtracking on big parts of an emerging deal has raised fears that the fragile negotiations are on the verge of collapse.\n\nAt a rally in Florida on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump vented that China reneged on its commitments.\n\n\"They broke the deal,\" he said, adding that he was just as happy to punish China with tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump plans on Friday morning to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent, including many consumer products that Americans rely on from Beijing, like seafood, luggage and electronics. The standoff is expected to raise prices for American companies and their customers across a large swath of sectors, potentially sending global stock markets falling.\n\nThe talks are due to resume around 5 p.m. at the offices of the United States Trade Representative.\n\nStock markets fell in the United States on Thursday morning, with the S&P 500 index down slightly more than 1 percent after trading began.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump's affinity for corporate America, its vocal concerns about the damage from the president's trade war and tariffs have done little to change the White House's approach.\n\n\"Clearly, we think a negotiating strategy based on tariffs is the wrong direction,\" said David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation. \"We're certainly hopeful that the Chinese, when they come to Washington this week, come with a plan to make substantial concessions to avert this disaster.\"\n\nBut Mr. Trump, already emboldened by a healthy American economy, may be encouraged to keep his trade war going given the monthly trade deficit with China fell in March to its lowest level since 2014 as China slowed its exports to America. The overall United States trade deficit with the world increased 1.5 percent in March to $50 billion, as it continued to import more goods and services than it exported worldwide.\n\nRetailers wielded their influence successfully in 2017 when Republicans were considering a tax plan that they believed would have harmed their businesses. But when it comes to trade, Mr. French said that the Trump administration had been intransigent about their tariff concerns. To make its point, the retail association has been holding events featuring businesses that are suffering from tariffs in politically important states like Ohio.\n\nMost business groups agree with Mr. Trump that China treats the United States unfairly on trade. They think that intellectual property protections need to be bolstered and that China's subsidies of state-owned enterprises must be curbed. Yet they also believe that the economic pain of tariffs makes them a poor negotiating tool.\n\n\"When the U.S. and China fight, nobody wins, as the past year's market gyrations, lost deals, and strained diplomatic ties have made abundantly clear,\" said Peter Robinson, chief executive of the United States Council for International Business. \"American business continues to have major problems with China's commercial policies, but we simply must find a way to tackle these that doesn't turn our most competitive companies into collateral damage.\"\n\nMr. Robinson suggested that the United States should team up with other trading partners to pressure China to change its ways and work with the World Trade Organization to adjudicate its complaints.\n\nThe United States and China appeared to be closing in on an agreement after more than a year of talks. Despite the sense of optimism, which Mr. Trump had often fanned, some of the president's top advisers signaled last week that the administration was running out of patience.\n\nSpeaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles last week, Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, said that the talks would not \"go on forever.\" Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said the negotiations were in their \"final laps\" and noted that it would soon be evident if it were time to strike a deal or walk away.\n\nAsked at the conference if he was feeling optimistic about the talks, Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of Blackstone and a confidant of Mr. Trump, rolled his eyes and said, \"we'll see.\"\n\nAfter Mr. Mnuchin and Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump's top trade negotiator, returned from a trip to Beijing last week, they were angered to receive from their Chinese counterparts a new draft of the agreement with major revisions to provisions they thought had been agreed to. According to people who have been tracking the talks, Chinese officials determined that many of the concessions they were being asked to make would clash with Chinese laws, which the government was not prepared to change.\n\n\"The administration has been talking to China for months now about specific things that needed to change in Chinese law,\" said Clete Willems, a former member of Mr. Trump's trade team who left recently to become a partner at the law firm Akin Gump. \"The administration was operating under the assumption that some of that would be part of the deal, so to the extent that China is saying that's no longer possible, that is a pretty big reversal.\"\n\nDespite Mr. Trump's threat of higher tariffs, China decided that it would send a delegation, led by Vice Premier Liu He, to Washington nonetheless. Still, it remains unclear if there will be sufficient time to avert the tariff increase and how forcefully China will respond.\n\nMr. Willems said that while both sides have overcome setbacks, Mr. Trump and his economic team believe that the progress that they have made with China is directly related to the president's willingness to impose tariffs.\n\n\"I do think more likely than not you're going to see tariffs going into place tomorrow,\" Mr. Willems said. \"This is not a bluff by the president.\"\n\nThis week Mr. Lighthizer has warned members of Congress to be prepared for the tariffs to increase, according to people familiar with the discussions, while Mr. Mnuchin has expressed hope that Mr. Liu will bring meaningful concessions to the table.\n\nAlthough there appears to be little time to resolve their remaining differences before the Friday deadline, a Trump administration official clarified that the higher tariffs would hit products leaving China on May 10. This could provide some additional time for the two sides to reach an agreement before those goods reach the United States.\n\nWall Street analysts have been girding for more volatility this week and many have been adjusting their predictions about the likelihood of an all out trade war.\n\n\"The opportunity window for avoiding a trade war is closing fast,\" economists at Citigroup wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThey warned that if tariffs increased, inflation in the United States could begin to tick up and financial conditions could tighten. A full-blown trade war is expected to be a drag on global economic growth.\n\nThus far, most companies have managed to absorb the brunt of the initial batch of China tariffs, keeping inflation at bay, but analysts warn that jumping to a rate of 25 percent will be impossible to ignore.\n\n\"Any maneuverability these companies had been using to blunt the impact of these tariffs is very likely exhausted,\" said Henrietta Treyz, director of economic policy at the investment advisory firm Veda Partners.\n\nEqually painful will be China's retaliatory measures, which Chinese officials have signaled are already being prepared. China has already imposed new duties on American products from soybeans to seafood, damaging businesses in parts of the United States where voters tend to support Mr. Trump.\n\nAn escalation in the trade dispute will probably mean more pressure on agricultural industries whose workers account for a large part of the president's base.\n\nLyle Benjamin, president of the Montana Grain Growers Association, said that China had essentially stopped buying American wheat since last year. He was hopeful that a trade truce would change that, but now he expected prices to keep falling.\n\n\"It's highly frustrating, particularly in the agricultural sector, to be collateral damage as we try to achieve these trade goals for other industries,\" Mr. Benjamin said. \"It's a tough game right now and it's tied almost entirely to this trade war.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alan_rappeport@nytimes.com", "name": "Alan Rappeport", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/09/business/09DC-CHINATRADE-1/09DC-CHINATRADE-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4770178", "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 295108800}, {"uri": "1131937678", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-09", "time": "12:39:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-09T12:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/05/09/until-trumps-trade-war-with-china-is-over-its-probably-best-you-dont-look-your-k/", "title": "Perspective | Until Trump's trade war with China is over, it's probably best you don't look at your 401(k)", "body": "By Michelle Singletary Michelle Singletary Personal finance columnist Columnist May 9 at 8:00 AM\n\nA few days before President Trump's latest govern-by-tweets were posted, I was ecstatic.

The bank wasn't wrong. It wasn't right, either.\n\nLast week I asked you: Do you think JPMorgan Chase deserved to be criticized?\n\n\"I absolutely think JPMorgan Chase deserved to be criticized,\" wrote Chanapa Tantibanchachai of Baltimore. \"Their tweet was tone-deaf and ignores the reality for many Americans who live paycheck to paycheck. This kind of fiscal responsibility ethos always insists that if Americans just took small steps, they'd be able to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. However, it doesn't recognize the fact that the problem isn't that the poor aren't saving the $20 in their checking account. The problem is that saving that $20 will never amount to anything when the system sets you up to fail. I used to be poor myself. Growing up, my family survived off my dad's minimum wage casino-card-dealer income. We lived in constant fear, as many low-income families do, with the knowledge that one minor car problem could set off a chain of events that would lead to unemployment and homelessness. There's no doubt that personal fiscal responsibility plays a role in uplifting the impoverished, but it's not enough, and society needs to support programs that can help end the cruel cycle of poverty instead of blaming the poor.\"\n\nCharles Bludworth of Friendswood, Tex., wrote, \"When I graduated from college 40 years ago with an engineering degree, I ate sack lunches most days, not because I couldn't eat out, but because I was saving for a future. It wasn't until I retired with more money than I need that I started buying $4 tea or coffee on morning outings with friends. I don't regret my frugality and wear it as a badge of honor. I see many others with lower earnings not being frugal, not realizing the potential to save if they would just start being content with $1 coffee (or make it at home) instead of chasing an elusive dream. I applaud chase.\"\n\n\"It's not that the advice was bad, or wrong,\" wrote Deborah Knowles of Gaithersburg, Md. \"It's the sheer tone deafness considering the source. Also, there's the point that JPMorgan Chase received an enormous bailout.\"\n\nRead: Trending: Did JPMorgan Chase forget about a pretty significant year known as 2008?\n\nMargaret Siemers of Dillsburg, Pa., wrote, \"I have worked for both a bank and a credit union, so I can truthfully say Chase deserved to be taken down a peg. [Many banks] will look for ways to make you pay a fee. A credit union will look for ways to help you save your money. For example, [often] when a bank runs its daily debits and credits on your account, they will take out all the debits first and credit money and refunds after. They do this because it generates fees. Most credit unions will credit all incoming deposits and credits before they run the debits. I urge anyone struggling with bank fees to check out your local credit union.\"\n\nNakia of Buffalo wrote, \"I see people all the time who aren't willing to sacrifice for the end goal. I buy 90 percent of my son's clothes from consignment shops.\"\n\nJohn Lombard of Queens, N.Y., wrote, \"Does JPMorgan Chase deserve to be criticized? That's actually more complicated than it seems. You're 100 percent right that, if you're just looking at the advice on the face of it, then no, they don't. It's fundamentally sound advice. It's not always easy to determine tone from a tweet or text the same way you can in a face-to-face conversation, but I don't think you can argue that it came across as anything other than mildly condescending at best. On a personal level, I see people every day spending money I know they shouldn't be spending. This isn't meant to sound self-righteous, but it's always easier to blame other people rather than be introspective and look at your own habits. I am going to be hugely in the minority here, but let's also remember it's not even in Chase's best interest for consumers to be educated. Educated customers not only don't make the bank any money, they cost the bank money in terms of lavish credit card reward redemptions and other perks that come at everyone else's expense. Chase deserves to be criticized for their tone and their delivery, but not for the message itself. I get that the vast majority of people either can't or won't separate the two, but again, given the current climate, it's not surprising.\n\n\"No, I don't think Chase deserves criticism for trying to encourage frugality,\" wrote PK Rutter of Tucson. \"But maybe their too cute message was not the best way to do it. And I cannot fault them for charging overdraft fees. If they didn't, think of how many people would take advantage of that. Why should Chase be left holding the bag for someone's overspending?\"\n\n\"The message Chase sent was right on the mark,\" wrote Allen Palmer of Morgan Hill, Calif. \"Most people don't realize how much all those 'little extras' add up to. Yes, people do need to be told the hard truths about spending versus saving.\"\n\nThomas Druitt of Paducah, Ky., a regular reader and commenter wrote, \"I think you had it right. Chase was both right and wrong. They were right to point out that a great deal of our own financial distress is self-inflicted and a direct result of unwise (not to say completely irrational) spending decisions that we make by ourselves, for ourselves and at the urging of no one but ourselves. They were wrong, or at least completely tone deaf, in not recognizing that no one, and I really mean no one, cares to be told to mend their financial ways by a huge global commercial bank.\"\n\nKeith Sado of Falls Church, Va., wrote, \"Yes, they deserve criticism, despite the validity of the issues they raise in their Twitter conversation. Advice on frugality is best coming from trusted and identifiable sources -- family/spouse, mentors, and financial writers. A financial institution's twitter account is not the ideal messenger!

Here's How China Could Respond.", "body": "A week ago, the United States and China looked as if they were going to reach a deal to end their trade war. Today, they are trying to salvage their many months of negotiations.\n\nVice Premier Liu He, a senior Chinese economic policy maker, is set to begin two days of negotiations in Washington on Thursday aimed at heading off an escalation. On Sunday, President Trump accused China of trying to renegotiate the nearly finished trade deal and threatened to impose more tariffs on Friday. Chinese officials have said they would respond, without specifying how. The prospect of a deepening trade war between the world's two largest economies has scared investors and darkened the global economic outlook.\n\nChina has strongly denied that it reneged on anything. \"Over the past one year's negotiation, our sincerity and kindness is obvious,\" Gao Feng, a Commerce Ministry spokesman, said at a news briefing on Thursday. \"Negotiations are the process of exchanging ideas, solving problems and reaching consensus. The two sides having different views is normal.\"\n\nChina has options if Mr. Trump goes ahead with his threat, including ways to strike at American businesses that go beyond tariffs.\n\n\"We expect China to quickly retaliate with matching tariffs,\" said Jake Parker, a vice president in Beijing for the U.S.-China Business Council, a business advocacy group representing 200 mostly large American companies that do business with China. \"We are also advising our members to prepare for increased customs scrutiny, regulatory enforcement at the local level, and diversification away from U.S. products.\"\n\nStill, Beijing's choices are painful and could hurt the Chinese economy just as much as they could hurt the United States.\n\nTrump's trade threat\n\nPresident Trump said on Sunday that American tariffs of 10 percent on $200 billion in Chinese goods, imposed last September, would rise to 25 percent on Friday. The tariffs would take effect just after midnight on Thursday, meaning the United States could wake up on Friday to an even more damaging trade war. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that the tariffs might be reconsidered if Beijing restored what the United States regards as previous Chinese commitments, and made progress beyond them.\n\nThe president also threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion in Chinese goods, without specifying when.\n\nMeeting tariffs with tariffs\n\nChina's obvious choice would be higher, and possibly wider, tariffs.\n\nIt could raise the retaliatory tariffs that it imposed on American-made goods last autumn. When President Trump imposed his 10 percent tariffs, Beijing responded by imposing a range of tariffs, from 5 percent to 25 percent, on $60 billion a year of American goods. That covered about two-fifths of Chinese imports from the United States.\n\nChina could also revive import barriers specifically aimed at some of the states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2016 election. In December, amid improved chances for a trade deal, China resumed buying American soybeans after it stopped buying them last summer. China also removed the 25 percent tariff that it had imposed last summer on American-made cars and sport utility vehicles.\n\nFor China, the problem with retaliatory tariffs is that they might not be enough to persuade Washington to relent. China has worked to diversify its economy, but it still depends heavily on exporting manufactured goods abroad, including to the United States. While some American businesses would be pinched by retaliatory Chinese tariffs, the broader economic impact on the United States could be more limited.\n\nTariffs are also only applied to a small portion of the prices consumers pay for purchases, so American shoppers wouldn't see big changes in price tags.\n\nChina could broaden its tariffs to cover the one-third of its imports from the United States that it has not yet penalized. These are mainly semiconductors and Boeing aircraft. But Chinese companies need the semiconductors, and there are few rival producers elsewhere for some of them. They would simply have to pay the tariffs and become less competitive.\n\nPutting tariffs on Boeing aircraft poses the same dilemma for Beijing. It would force Chinese airlines to buy from Airbus, the only real alternative supplier. Airbus would then be able to charge much higher prices.\n\nWeaponizing shoppers\n\nAnother option is for the Chinese government to encourage the country's consumers to boycott American products, or to allow such boycotts to be organized at a grass-roots level. China has used this weapon during foreign policy disputes with South Korea and Japan over the past decade.\n\nBut once unleashed, Chinese nationalism could be hard to contain. If a boycott led to anti-American protests in the streets, Beijing's ability to reach deals with the United States would be constrained. A boycott also could hurt China's consumers, by limiting their choices, and hurt the Chinese workers who make American-branded cars, assemble iPhones and brew Starbucks lattes.\n\nChina's other options\n\nIf China really wants to fight back hard, it has other options. But all of them have big potential drawbacks.\n\nIt could delay imports from the United States through elaborate customs inspections and quarantines. China temporarily delayed last year its imports of Lincoln sport utility vehicles by the Ford Motor Company and apples, oranges and cherries from American farmers. It could also send inspectors to check out the business licenses and operations.\n\nIf China wanted to get Mr. Trump's attention in a big way, it could outright hinder the global supply chain. China makes a huge amount of the parts and components that American companies need to produce their finished products. Many American companies have asked trade officials for exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese goods, contending that they are heavily dependent on these products. Lou Jiwei, a former finance minister of China with many connections to the Chinese leadership, suggested at a conference last September that Chinese officials might study the filings and block exports of some of these products.\n\nThat would disrupt corporate supply chains. But it could also permanently damage China's reputation as a reliable supplier for practically every large company in the West. Foreign companies are already re-evaluating their dependence on China as a manufacturing hub.\n\nFinally, China could let the value of its currency, the renminbi, slide sharply against the dollar. That would make China's exports less expensive and more competitive in foreign markets, and could partly offset the cost of higher tariffs.\n\nBut letting the renminbi drop could pose the greatest risks of all. It would make oil and other imports more expensive in China, fanning Chinese inflation at a time when prices are already starting to rise. And if a falling currency prompts Chinese companies and families to evade limits on moving their money overseas, a flood of outbound money could destabilize China's financial system.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keith_bradsher@nytimes.com", "name": "Keith Bradsher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/09/world/09chinaoptions/09chinaoptions-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4770178", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 295101420}, {"uri": "1131813500", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-09", "time": "09:57:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-09T09:57:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.9686274528503418, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/trump-economy-democrats-2020.html", "title": "Opinion | Democrats, the Economy, and the Election", "body": "Trump's opponent needs to celebrate prosperity, not deny or trivialize it.\n\nFor more than two years, Democrats and their media friends have confidently insisted the U.S. economy under Donald Trump (a) would crash and burn; or (b) benefits only the few; or (c) was fake; or, failing all of that, was just (d) the lucky beneficiary of policies put into place under Barack Obama.\n\nNone of these arguments is tenable today. Anyone seriously interested in defeating Trump at the polls next year should stop making them.\n\nThe very pleasant reality of the U.S. economy was neatly captured in the headline of Neil Irwin's analysis last Friday in The Times: \"The Economy That Wasn't Supposed to Happen: Booming Jobs, Low Inflation.\" Unemployment is at 3.6 percent, a 50-year low. Job creation remains strong. Average hourly earnings are up 3.2 percent over last year. Inflation is 1.6 percent.\n\n\"After more than two years of the Trump administration, warnings that trade wars and erratic management style would throw the economy off course have proved wrong so far,\" Irwin writes, \"and tax cuts and deregulation are most likely part of the reason for the strong growth rates in 2018 and the beginning of 2019.\"\n\nIrwin allows that the economy could slow as the effects of the tax cuts fade. That's always possible. But for now, the economy is in even better shape than the headline data suggest.\n\nThere have been more job openings than job seekers for 13 straight months. Workers without college degrees have seen significant gains in their wages. Productivity growth is up, unusual at this point in an almost decade-long expansion. There are no obvious bubbles in tech, real estate or other industries, and the Dow has mostly recovered from last year's swoon.\n\nAnd as an astute friend pointed out to me recently, Trump's scary tweets even seem to have the effect of tempering market exuberance, acting as a kind of check in lieu of interest-rate hikes.\n\nHow should Democrats deal with the good news? Denial can't work forever.\n\nIn 2017, denial took the form of emphasizing the issue of wage stagnation -- but then wages stopped stagnating. In 2018 the critics said the tax bill would provide nothing more than a sugar high for the economy, and yet the recovery has, if anything, accelerated. Earlier this year, we had \"the incredible shrinking Trump boom\" -- until the data showed no shrinkage.\n\nNow the Often-Wrong-But-Never-Humbled Department tells us the boom is really just a big fat Keynesian stimulus incurred at the cost of our ballooning budget deficits. Perhaps it is, but then how does the department explain the last 30 months of its doom-saying?\n\nEventually, of course, a recession will come. Recessions always do. The problem for Democrats is that there's no guarantee that it will come before the election. In the meantime, they've left a trail of bad forecasts that make them look silly and out-of-touch -- which the Trump campaign will gleefully use against them.\n\nMore importantly, it creates the perception that Democrats (at least those of the more ideological variety) are secretly hoping for a downturn, both to help their electoral chances and vindicate their own past predictions.\n\nIt's unbecoming. It suggests a party led by people for whom questions of job creation and growth will always be abstractions, since their own jobs and prospects will always be safe. It's what The Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan shrewdly described in 2016 as the \"protected class\" -- the people who make policies but never really have to live with the consequences.\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton was the candidate of the protected class, Trump of the unprotected. If Democrats decide to run against prosperity -- either by pretending it isn't really happening or that it doesn't matter -- it will only send a message to the voters they lost last time that the party still doesn't get it.\n\nThey'll lose again.\n\nThere's a reason Trump's approval rating is now at 46 percent -- the highest of his presidency, according to Gallup -- despite all the Democratic thundering about William Barr's testimony to Congress and the renewed talk of impeachment. Wittingly or not, Trump is delivering on the core promise of the presidency.\n\nThere's also a reason that Joe Biden has taken a commanding early lead in the race for the Democratic nomination. His central theme is that he's a regular guy who will restore regular order to Washington and regular behavior in the White House without mucking things up through a grand redesign of American capitalism. It isn't clear that Biden will be able to get through the primary without putting both feet in his mouth and falling flat on his face. But that's the right theory of the race.\n\nDemocrats need a candidate who gets this. They need someone who will work to enlarge our prosperity, not redistribute it. They need someone who can communicate and deliver, without embarrassing and frightening normal people the way Trump does.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Unfortunately, most of the details of the true-life version remain secret, under seal at the U.S. attorney's office in Alexandria or in the vaults of the CIA. But knowledgeable sources sketched parts of the story that aren't classified.\n\nJerry Chun Shing Lee, who was a CIA case officer from 1994 to 2007, pleaded guilty May 1 to conspiring with Chinese intelligence agents to provide secret information. U.S. officials won't discuss the precise damage Lee did, but intelligence experts believe he was part of an aggressive Chinese spy operation that led to the exposure, arrest and execution of at least 20 CIA sources inside China. For an intelligence service such as the CIA, that's as bad as it gets.\n\nThe resolution of the Lee case comes at a time when the Trump administration is threatening to escalate its trade war against Beijing to force China to stop stealing commercial secrets and allow fairer trade. The negotiations will hit a deadline Friday, when the administration has threatened to raise tariffs to 25 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese products.\n\nTrump's hard-nosed and sometimes erratic bargaining tactics have roiled financial markets this week. But as the Lee case shows, the Chinese are hardly innocent victims. They have been burrowing deep into the CIA to steal its most precious secrets, as well as pilfering corporate data wherever they can.\n\nLee pleaded guilty to only one count of conspiracy, and prosecutors said his plea agreement and an accompanying statement of evidence were \"not intended to be a full enumeration of all of the facts surrounding the defendant's case.\" Asked if Lee had agreed to cooperate with the CIA in sharing additional details, his attorney, Edward B. MacMahon Jr., responded: \"There is nothing in the plea agreement that deals with his cooperating.\"\n\nThe hunt for a Chinese mole began after the CIA started losing its key sources in China in 2010. Lee, who first met with Chinese intelligence officers in April 2010, according to prosecutors, soon came under suspicion. Another suspect was a former senior case officer who had served in China when the blown network of spies was recruited.\n\nThe senior case officer was eventually cleared, thanks to Chinese tradecraft mistakes that revealed their contact with Lee, a source said. The bungling came in Thailand in 2013, when Chinese spies made a sudden recruitment pitch to a former CIA operative who had worked with the senior case officer. She figured that someone had given the Chinese operative her name and told him it must have been Lee.\n\nHer Chinese would-be recruiter then foolishly blurted out: \"No, I'm not handling Jerry. It's another team,\" according to a knowledgeable source.\n\nThe former operative and her senior colleague promptly reported the conversation to the FBI, which added the Thailand evidence to its Lee file. In 2012, the FBI had copied two notebooks and a flash drive that Lee brought with him to Hawaii, according to prosecutors. That evidence helped lead to Lee's conviction last week.\n\nIf Lee hadn't made his plea agreement, prosecutors were ready to present evidence about the secret meeting in Thailand, the bungled pitch and the Chinese admission of their relationship with Lee, a source said.\n\nThe damage from this case still makes the intelligence community wince. \"They wiped us out in China. All the networks we had were gone,\" one former official said. Officials speculate that the Chinese may have used their contact with Lee to unravel other communications and tradecraft secrets. \"It was a double whammy: human sources and technical sources,\" the former official said.\n\nThe Chinese mole case has been a subject of CIA corridor gossip, and occasional press stories, for several years. The CIA won't comment.\n\nMacMahon protests: \"If someone wants to accuse my client of getting people killed, they should attach their names to that charge. It's not even part of this case.\"\n\nHere's a last Chinese riddle. Experts say that in the Thailand meeting, the Chinese operative asked the former CIA officer about cases that Lee shouldn't have known about. Which leads to an eerie question: Was there another Chinese mole, buried even deeper?\n\nSpy fact can be much scarier than spy fiction.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\nSteve Bannon: We're in an economic war with China.

It is why it is down so little.\n\nAfter all, the world's two largest economies have seemed to be hurtling toward a major escalation of their trade war. American officials have complained that Chinese negotiators have been playing a bait-and-switch, backing away from concessions they had agreed to.\n\nPresident Trump said the United States would raise its tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent on Friday, and begin taxing the remaining $325 billion of goods at that rate \"shortly.\" For a while, it was unclear whether negotiations would resume at all this week.\n\nIf trade talks did disintegrate, even with the arrival of high-level Chinese officials in Washington, the economy would be in danger of experiencing a meaningful downturn and potentially a recession. Economists at Moody's Analytics, for example, expect it would subtract 1.8 percentage points from G.D.P. growth and cause unemployment to rise.\n\nIt would particularly hammer the financial results of some of the prominent American companies that either import Chinese goods or rely on the country as a major export market.\n\nYet the Standard & Poor's 500 index was down only 2.1 percent in the first two trading days of the week, and little changed in Wednesday's trading as of midday. The index has given up only about a month's worth of gains; markets were lower as recently as early April.\n\nThe answer lies in a few words: the Trump Put.\n\nA \"put\" is a type of option security that lets people put a floor under their losses. If you buy stock for $50 a share and also a put with a $40 strike price, you are protected from losing more than $10 per share.\n\nIn his 28 months in office, Mr. Trump has created a sense in markets that he will play that role for the economy as a whole. His administration has followed through on some of his threats -- applying tariffs on many steel and aluminum imports, the existing tariffs on Chinese imports that Mr. Trump threatened to expand on Sunday -- but has backed off whenever markets and the economy have looked soft.\n\nThe prime example is late last year, when financial markets were falling and the risk of recession rising. The emergence of constructive negotiations between American and Chinese officials -- in particular after a Feb. 22 Oval Office meeting -- was one factor in a rally that has driven stocks up 15 percent so far in 2019. The Federal Reserve's decision to back off plans for interest rate increases, as well as successful Chinese efforts to stimulate its economy, were other major factors.\n\nIf you're trying to bet on where markets will be six months or a year from now, there are a few things you know. The president of the United States cares a lot about what happens to the stock market, as his tweets make plain. He will be running for re-election in 18 months. He enjoys making big, bold promises, many of which don't materialize.\n\nThat adds up to a conviction that nothing really bad will happen -- that the administration will strike some kind of deal, even if it does little to address long-term economic tensions between the United States and China.\n\nThe only problem is that the existence of the Trump Put creates a funny circular system.\n\nPresident Trump is more confident in taking an aggressive negotiating stand because the stock market is up a lot this year and the American economy is looking solid. The perception of a Trump Put means that markets don't fall very much even with that tougher negotiating stand. But that, in turn, means a weaker signal to the president and his inner circle that there would be negative consequences if they followed through with the president's Twitter threats to place tariffs on all Chinese imports.\n\nWith China's vice premier, Liu He, set to come to Washington for two days of talks, there is plenty of incentive for both sides to reach a deal.\n\nBut the existence of the Trump Put seems to increase the odds of a miscalculation. The danger would be greater if the relatively muted market response to the threats of escalation caused Trump administration negotiators to believe his line that the United States economy was doing well because of tariffs (as Mr. Trump has tweeted) and not despite them (as almost all mainstream economists believe).\n\nIt's not the most likely outcome, but if that miscalculation happens and the Trump Put turns out to be less reliable than it appeared, we will most likely find ourselves in a more damaging sort of global trade war than anything we've seen up to this point.\n\nAnd that, in turn, could make the turbulence in markets this week seem downright quaint.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_irwin@nytimes.com", "name": "Neil Irwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/08/upshot/08up-markets/08up-markets-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4770178", "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 295030680}, {"uri": "1131149963", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-08", "time": "14:51:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-08T14:51:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5490196347236633, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2019/05/08/daily-202-tax-records-show-how-trump-profited-off-spreading-rumors-until-investors-stopped-believing-him/5cd1b4d21ad2e506550b2f96/", "title": "The Daily 202: Tax records show how Trump profited off spreading rumors  --  until investors stopped believing him", "body": "Mark Twain coined that term to describe America in the late 19th century. His point was that the country appeared to be glittering, but it was a facade.\n\nTax numbers published last night by the New York Times highlight a jarring contrast between Trump's self-created mythology as a master dealmaker and a litany of cold, hard financial facts that he's kept concealed until now.\n\nA source leaked 10 years of figures from Trump's 1985 through 1994 federal income tax forms. The transcripts show that the president paid no federal income tax for eight of those 10 years. He reported a net $1.17 billion of losses over that stretch. In multiple years, Trump reportedly lost more money than nearly any other individual taxpayer in the United States. His $418 million of losses in 1991 alone represented 1 percent of all losses declared by individual taxpayers in the entire country that year.\n\nThe most fascinating passage of the lengthy Times article, deep in the second half, focuses on the three years Trump spent \"posing as a corporate raider\" from 1986 through 1988. He had overleveraged himself by taking out huge loans at high interest rates and making questionable spending decisions. Two weeks before the stock market crashed in October 1987, for example, Trump bought a 282-foot yacht for $29 million.\n\nThe president recognized as a relatively young man - still in his early 40s - that he could profit off his celebrity and perceived business acumen. This was around the time that his book \"The Art of the Deal\" came out in 1987. He didn't have the assets to purchase large publicly traded companies, but he knew that other people didn't know that - especially after he successfully bamboozled Forbes Magazine into wildly overestimating his wealth. He expressed interest and spread rumors that he was looking to acquire companies he knew he couldn't and wouldn't.\n\n\"Trump made a total of $57 million by briefly presenting himself as a takeover threat to, among others, Hilton Hotels, the Gillette razor company and Federated Department Stores ... In all, from 1986 through 1989, Mr. Trump declared $67.3 million in gains from stocks and other assets bought and sold within one year,\" Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig report. \"As with many things Trump, his adventures in the stock market were more image than substance, helped greatly by news reports quoting anonymous sources said to have knowledge of Mr. Trump's actions. An occasional quote from an associate -- including his stockbroker, Alan C. Greenberg -- helped burnish the myth. 'He has an appetite like a Rocky Mountain vulture,' Mr. Greenberg, the legendary chairman of Bear Stearns, told the Wall Street Journal in 1987. 'He'd like to own the world.' In his actions, Mr. Trump was more like a peacock.\"\n\nInvestors grew wise to Trump's game - eventually - so it caught up with him and stopped working. In 1989, Trump bought up American Airlines stock and then announced he was thinking about buying the huge company. \"I'm very skeptical of everything this man does,\" Andrew Geller, then an airline analyst at Provident National Bank in Philadelphia, told the Associated Press.\n\n\"Mr. Trump was rebuffed, and the stock price fell sharply. Though at the time his losses were reported to be modest, the new tax return figures show that in 1990, the year he sold his American Airlines stake, Mr. Trump lost $34.9 million on short-term trades, wiping out half his gains from the previous four years,\" per Buettner and Craig.\n\nThe bluffer in chief had overplayed his hand.\n\n-- Reacting to the Times story, Trump said this morning that claiming massive losses to minimize his tax bill was \"sport.\" The president tweeted that it was routine for all real estate developers in the 1980s and 1990s to claim \"massive write offs\" and depreciation. \"You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes ... and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport,\" Trump tweeted. \"Additionally, the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!\"\n\n-- Trump didn't face the personal consequences that most people would for losing so much money. The lenders were largely left holding the bag, and he could always count on his father, Fred, for a bailout. The Times reporters who wrote this story won the Pulitzer Price last month for revealing that Trump received at least $413 million in today's dollars from his dad. This backstop meant that the president's standard of living didn't decline even in the face of repeated failure. This allowed him to project the image that he was winning, which allowed him to borrow more money and bounce back.\n\n-- The Times also reports there are no itemized deductions for charitable giving in the records obtained by the paper: \"Because Mr. Trump reported a negative adjusted gross income in each of the 10 years, he was not allowed to deduct any charitable contributions. So while he has boasted of making large donations at the time, the information ... shows no such itemized deductions. Potential deductions could have been carried over to a future year, should Mr. Trump have reported a positive income.\"\n\n-- In this era of Theranos, the Fyre Festival and Trump University, the story is a good reminder that not all that glitters is gold.\n\n-- Congressional Democrats say these records from three decades ago show the need to see more, especially to understand how he climbed out of the hole he dug himself into and the extent to which he has depended on foreign investors. \"As these records make clear, Trump was perhaps the worst businessman in the world. His entire campaign was a lie,\" Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.) said in a statement. \"He didn't pay taxes for years and lost over $1 billion dollars. How is that possible? How did he keep getting more money and where on Earth was it all going? We need to know now. Second, we must still see Trump's actual returns over the last generation. The IRS must abide by the legal requirement to provide them as requested under Section 6103(f). We now have another part of the truth. We need a lot more.\"\n\n-- House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richie Neal suggested last night that he will soon go to court to pursue the last six years of Trump's personal and business returns, now that the administration formally rejected his request to turn over the president's records voluntarily. The Democrat from Massachusetts has scheduled a meeting with the House counsel for Thursday to discuss next steps. \"I was never naive about it,\" Neal told Erica Werner, \"and I thought that it would end up in the courts.\"\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- At least eight people were killed in an explosion outside the Data Darbar Sufi shrine in Pakistan, one of the oldest Muslim shrines in South Asia, during Ramadan. From the AP's Zaheer Babar: \"Officials said it was not clear if the target was the shrine itself ... or police outside guarding it. Hundreds of pilgrims were inside and outside the shrine, where a local Sufi saint is buried, when the blast took place. ... Lahore police chief Ghazanfar Ali said five police and three passers-by were killed in the attack, adding that the toll could rise as some of the wounded were in critical condition. ... Chaudhry Mohammad Sarwar, the governor of Punjab province, told reporters that those who carried out Wednesday's attack were the 'enemy of Islam and humanity.' No group has claimed responsibility yet for the attack in the Muslim-majority country, the BBC notes.\n\n-- An 18-year-old student was killed in a shooting at a suburban school in Denver, and eight other students were injured. Susan Svrluga, Perry Stein and Nick Anderson report: \"Two suspects, both students at the school, are in custody ... The adult suspect was named late Tuesday as 18-year-old Devon Erickson. ... The shooting happened shortly before 2 p.m. Tuesday local time at the STEM School Highlands Ranch -- a charter school campus with more than 1,800 students in kindergarten through 12th grade. The shooters were able to walk in and get deep inside the school, Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said. ... The injured students were 15 years old or older, he said. ... A handgun was used, he said, but he did not have other information about weapons. No teachers or staff members were injured, to his knowledge.\"\n\n-- The Justice Department informed the House Judiciary Committee late last night that it would ask Trump to assert executive privilege over all of the underlying evidence in Bob Mueller's report, a hostile move that all but assures Attorney General Bill Barr will be held in contempt of Congress later today. Rachael Bade and Matt Zapotosky report: \"In a late-night letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), assistant attorney general Stephen E. Boyd argued that the Justice Department had tried to accommodate Democrats' demands for the release of the full Mueller report, which the Judiciary panel subpoenaed for its investigation into the president. But Boyd said that Democrats -- who made a counteroffer to the Justice Department in a last-ditch negotiation session to stave off a scheduled contempt vote for Barr Wednesday morning -- 'has responded to our accommodation efforts by escalating its unreasonable demands.'\"\n\n-- House Democrats threatened to hold Don McGahn in contempt after Trump invoked executive privilege to block the former White House counsel from complying with a subpoena to turn over documents. Rachael Bade, Carol D. Leonnig and Josh Dawsey report: \"In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone said McGahn does not have the legal right to comply with its subpoena for 36 types of documents -- most related to Mueller's nearly two-year probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. ... Democrats rejected the White House moves as illegitimate, arguing that the Trump administration hadn't officially completed the paperwork to assert privilege. And even if it had, the committee continued, it would not apply because the White House waived privilege for McGahn long ago.\"\n\n-- FBI Director Chris Wray distanced himself from Trump and Barr's use of the term \"spying\" to describe the investigation into Trump's 2016 campaign. Devlin Barrett reports: \"'That's not the term I would use,' Wray said in response to a question from Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) during a congressional hearing about the FBI's budget. Wray, who took over the bureau in 2017, urged lawmakers to wait for the findings from Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who is expected to issue a report in a month or two about the origins of the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign, and the law enforcement tools that were used, including foreign intelligence surveillance court orders.\"\n\n-- House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) threatened to withhold the salaries of Interior, Commerce and Justice Department staffers who block committee investigations. The committee called for eight current and former Trump administration officials to provide information for two investigations, one into the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, and one into whether Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and his staff complied with record-keeping laws. (The Hill)\n\n-- Some of the former federal prosecutors who signed the open letter saying that Trump would have faced criminal charges if he weren't president sought to clarify they are not endorsing impeachment. Matt Zapotosky reports: \"The signers included some left-leaning lawyers who have gained prominence from their frequent TV appearances, but also a significant number of career prosecutors and high-profile conservatives who bristle at the suggestion they were motivated by anti-Trump bias. A handful interviewed by The Post on Tuesday said they hoped for little else than to make public their view that Barr had mischaracterized Mueller's report in asserting it laid out insufficient evidence to make an obstruction case. They said they did not sign hoping to spark impeachment proceedings.\"\n\n-- Mueller and his prosecutors sought to block the public release of James Comey's memos last year because they feared Trump and other witnesses would change their stories after reading the former FBI director's full version of events. CNN's Katelyn Polantz reports: \"A court order on Tuesday forced the Justice Department to provide a transcript of the hearing to CNN as part of a lawsuit over access to the Comey memos. The Justice Department implored a federal judge to keep the memos under seal after CNN and other news organizations asked for their release. Mueller's plea to keep the memos under seal coincided with negotiations with Trump's legal team over a potential interview with the President at Camp David, planned for the days following the court hearing and which ultimately fell through.\"\n\n-- Nothing to see here! Mitch McConnell joined fellow Republicans in saying \"case closed\" and demanding an end to the congressional probe of Russia and its interference to help Trump win in 2016. Mike DeBonis, Rachael Bade and Matt Zapotosky report: \"Inside the Capitol, Republicans stood with Trump, as they have repeatedly since the start of his presidency. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who frequently talks about the Constitution, said he was not concerned about the precedent the White House was setting in ignoring congressional subpoenas. ... GOP Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Cory Gardner (Colo.), both seeking reelection next year in states Trump lost in 2016, declined to challenge McConnell's view, with Gardner using Trump's oft-repeated assessment. 'The report talks about no collusion, no cooperation, so what are you talking about?' Gardner said.\"\n\n-- Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, promised that his panel's forthcoming report will divulge more details on Russian election interference than Mueller included in his telling. Karoun Demirjian reports: \"'We're addressing two different lanes,' [Burr said]. 'The tough thing is, everything that we're going to report on already has a narrative.' ... Burr and the committee's vice chairman, Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), have managed to shield their panel's work from much of the partisan pressure that splintered other probes ... In the process, they collected what several members and aides described as a 'mountain' of evidence exposing the degree to which Russia exploited social media and weaknesses in U.S. election systems.\"\n\n-- The Pentagon's Cyber Command probed the networks of other countries to explore threats and gain insights that could help the U.S. thwart foreign interferences during the 2020 campaign. Ellen Nakashima reports: \"Code-named Synthetic Theology, last year's operation leveraged new authorities, granted by the president and Congress, enabling U.S. agencies to become more aggressive in foreign cyberspace in defense of the nation. Though the operation has ended, Cybercom is continuing its close relationship with the National Security Agency and working to build partnerships with other nations ... Aided by NSA intelligence, Cybercom's midterm operation successfully blocked Russian trolls working at the infamous Internet Research Agency from posting divisive messages on U.S. social media in an effort to sow discord among Americans as they went to the polls in November.\"\n\n-- After Donald Trump Jr. targeted her on social media, the White House recalled the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, ahead of her scheduled departure. Josh Rogin writes: \"Yovanovitch will leave her post permanently on May 20, with no replacement in place and no nominations to fill that position. ... The House Democratic leadership thinks that Yovanovitch's early departure under pressure is a clear sign that the White House is responding to calls from Trump allies, Trump family members and conservative media sites that have accused Yovanovitch, without firm evidence, of being part of a conspiracy that involves anti-corruption probes in Ukraine.\"\n\nTHE TRADE WARS:\n\n-- Trump's ongoing trade war with China has caused a rift inside his administration, as top officials like Steven Mnuchin and economic adviser Larry Kudlow have urged the president to abandon the tariffs that threaten to drag down his reelection prospects. Toluse Olorunnipa and Seung Min Kim report: \"As Trump prepares to run on the economy, his threat to increase tariffs on imports from China has sent the stock market diving and undercut a stretch of positive economic news. U.S. farmers and exporters, already bearing the brunt of China's retaliatory tariffs, now face the prospect of an escalated trade war in which states that Trump needs to win reelection will be in the crosshairs. ... White House officials said Trump is prepared to take a hard line with China going into 2020 in part because he intends to keep his 2016 campaign promise to fix what he views as bad trade deals. ... Trump's trade agenda is likely to play a central role in the 2020 race, as Democrats seek to challenge his economic message and compete with him in export-reliant states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\"\n\n-- Nonpartisan career economists at the Agriculture Department say they are quitting after suffering retaliation for publishing reports detailing how badly American farmers have been hurt by Trump's policies, especially his tariffs. Politico's Ryan McCrimmon reports: \"The Economic Research Service -- a source of closely read reports on farm income and other topics that can shape federal policy, planting decisions and commodity markets -- has run afoul of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue with its findings on how farmers have been financially harmed by [Trump's] trade feuds, the Republican tax code rewrite and other sensitive issues, according to current and former agency employees. The reports highlight the continued decline under Trump's watch in farm income, which has dropped about 50 percent since 2013.\"\n\n-- Experts at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute estimate that every job saved or created by Trump's steel tariffs cost U.S. consumers more than $900,000. Heather Long reports: \"The cost is more than 13 times the typical salary of a steelworker, according to Labor Department data, and it is similar to other economists' estimates that Trump's tariffs on washing machines are costing consumers $815,000 per job created. ... Many economists and business leaders point out that jobs in steel-using industries outnumber those in steel production by about 80 to 1, according to experts at Harvard University and the University of California at Davis.\"\n\n-- Americans could soon pay 40 percent to 85 percent more for tomatoes after Trump's new 17.5 percent tariff on Mexican tomato imports went into effect yesterday. Laura Reiley reports: \"The tariffs follow a breakdown of a 22-year-old agreement that had attempted to maintain the peace between American and Mexican tomato growers. ... Mexican imports account for about 54 percent of the U.S. tomato market. ... [An Arizona State] study found that American consumers will pay the lion's share of the tariff impact because the demand for fresh tomatoes is relatively steady.\"\n\n-- Trump's brinkmanship with China this week represents a test of his administration's tougher stance as he attempts to secure a trade deal with Beijing while preserving its cooperation on North Korea. David Nakamura and Ashley Parker report: \"The specter of escalating tensions illustrated the risks of Trump's China strategy as he has simultaneously pursued denuclearization talks with North Korea, which have rested in part on Beijing's enforcement of sweeping inter\u00adnational economic sanctions on its neighbor. Analysts said Beijing has not directly linked the two issues, but they warned that mounting hostilities with Washington could complicate the picture at a time when nuclear negotiations have stalled.\"\n\n-- The Pentagon has given up hope of recovering any more remains of American troops killed in the Korean War, at least in the near future. Reuters's Josh Smith reports: \"The U.S. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA), which works to recover missing American troops around the world, said on Wednesday that it had not heard from North Korean officials since the second U.S.-North Korea summit, held in Hanoi in February, ended with no agreement.\"\n\nSABER RATTLING AND ESCALATION OVER IRAN:\n\n-- Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced today that his country is taking steps to halt its compliance with elements of a landmark nuclear deal in response to Trump pulling out of the accord and stiffening sanctions on Tehran. Tamer El-Ghobashy reports: \"In a televised speech, Rouhani said that Iran would keep stockpiles of excess uranium and heavy water that is used in nuclear reactors. He gave a 60-day deadline for new terms to the nuclear accord, after which Tehran would resume higher uranium enrichment. The speech coincided with the anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal last year. ... On Friday, the State Department announced new restrictions on Iran's civil nuclear program, despite protests by European allies.\"\n\n-- The U.S. Navy announced it has canceled a planned port visit in Croatia for an aircraft carrier group because its deployment to the Middle East was expedited in response to \"recent and clear indications\" that Iran is preparing to attack U.S. troops in the region. Dan Lamothe reports: \"The USS Abraham Lincoln, traveling with a fleet of escort ships, will make way for the Middle East as part of a deployment announced Sunday by White House national security adviser John Bolton. The Lincoln already was due to 'spend a significant amount of time' in the Middle East, but it will now arrive earlier than initially planned, the Pentagon said in an emailed statement responding to questions from numerous reporters.\"\n\n-- After abruptly breaking away from a European trip and canceling a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an unannounced visit to Iraq to discuss Iran. Carol Morello and Missy Ryan report: \"After flying out of Baghdad late at night, Pompeo said he had told Iraqi President Barham Salih and Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi that they are responsible for protecting Americans in their country and briefed them on intelligence suggesting Iran is posing a greater threat. 'We wanted to let them know about the increased threat stream that we had seen and give them a little bit more background on that so they could ensure that they were doing all they could to provide protection for our team,' Pompeo told reporters. 'They understood, too, it's important for their country. We don't want anyone interfering in their country .... and there was complete agreement.'\"\n\n-- Deja vu? Some U.S. officials worry the Trump administration is overreacting to or otherwise overhyping intelligence on Iran, which they fear could lead to unplanned hostilities. The Daily Beast's Betsy Woodruff and Adam Rawnsley report: \"'It's not that the administration is mischaracterizing the intelligence, so much as overreacting to it,' said one U.S. government official briefed on it. Another source familiar with the situation agreed that the Trump administration's response was an 'overreaction' but didn't dispute that a threat exists. ... 'I would characterize the current situation as shaping operations on both sides to tilt the field in preparation for a possible coming conflict,' continued the second source, who is also a U.S. government official. 'The risk is a low-level proxy unit miscalculating and escalating things. We're sending a message with this reaction to the intelligence, even though the threat might not be as imminent as portrayed.'\"\n\nALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN:\n\n-- Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney who is now in prison, said he helped prevent the release of embarrassing personal photographs of Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. shortly before the evangelical leader endorsed Trump for president in 2016. Felicia Sonmez and Sarah Pulliam Bailey report: \"Cohen made the assertion, which was first reported by Reuters, in a phone call in March with actor Tom Arnold. Arnold provided The Washington Post with a recording of the call Tuesday night. [Click the image above to listen.] 'There's a bunch of photographs -- you know, personal photographs -- that somehow, the guy ended up getting,' Cohen said on the call. The person who had the photos, who is not identified on the call, was demanding money from the Falwells, and Cohen threatened to report the person to legal authorities, according to Reuters. ... A statement released by an attorney for the Falwells called the account 'not accurate.'\"\n\n-- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin addressed a group of \"bundlers for Trump's reelection campaign during a fundraising event last night at the Trump hotel in D.C., a highly unusual political appearance at a gathering that included industry executives he is charged with regulating. Michelle Ye Hee Lee, Josh Dawsey and Damian Paletta report: \"Mnuchin's attendance at the kickoff event for the Trump Victory Committee came a day after he rejected a request from House Democrats for Trump's tax returns. ... Treasury secretaries in recent years have avoided attending fundraiser events with people they could be tasked with regulating, in part because of their unique role in overseeing a broad swath of companies in the financial system. His presence would be acutely noted by industry executives in attendance, said legal experts, who noted that the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law gave Mnuchin tremendous power over a broad swath of companies.\"\n\nFlashback: A political firestorm erupted in 1996 when then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin attended a fundraiser for Bill Clinton's reelection campaign. Republicans seized on the event and highlighted the conflicts of interest. Clinton later said the optics were poor and that \"mistakes were made.\"\n\n-- Trump's appointees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau proposed new rules to debt collectors to deliver an unlimited number of text messages and emails to consumers. Renae Merle reports: \"The proposal is a victory for debt collectors such as San Francisco-based TrueAccord. Instead of making a barrage of phone calls, TrueAccord sends out millions of emails and texts every month. Next, it hopes to contact delinquent consumers through chat programs such as WhatsApp. ... But this digital-first approach has alarmed consumer advocates who worry that the CFPB could give an industry known for high pressure tactics a new way to violate consumers' privacy.\"\n\n-- Trump wants to shut down the Office of Personnel Management, but the president's nominee to lead the agency had almost nothing to say about its potential demise during her confirmation hearing. Joe Davidson reports: Virginia Dale Cabaniss \"promised transparency and to work with Congress, as all nominees do. She had no specifics to offer on the future of OPM, which has about 5,500 employees. If the Trump administration succeeds at dismantling OPM, it would be the first major federal agency eliminated since the World War II era. ... Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.), the top Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, was clearly frustrated with the administration's inability or refusal to provide Congress information on the reorganization.\"\n\n-- Betsy DeVos testified that her top priority is expanding charter schools and other alternatives to traditional public schools. In response, Democratic lawmakers are slashing federal funding for charters. They're citing concerns over DeVos's ability to be a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars flowing into the programs. Valerie Strauss reports: \"The House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday released its proposed 2020 budget for the Education Department and is seeking $75.9 billion. That is $11.9 billion more than [the Trump budget request], and $4.4 billion more than what was enacted in 2019. There are big boosts for Title 1 -- a program intended to help children from low-income families -- and special education. The section on charter schools is seeking $400 million for the federal Charter Schools Program, which is $40 million less than what was given last year and $100 million less than Trump's proposed budget.\"\n\nTHE IMMIGRATION WARS:\n\n-- The Trump administration sent new guidelines to asylum officers that direct them to take a more confrontational approach during interviews with migrants seeking refuge. Nick Miroff reports: \"The asylum officers will more aggressively challenge applicants whose claims of persecution contain discrepancies, and they will need to provide detailed justifications before concluding that an applicant has a well-founded fear of harm if deported to their home country. The changes require officers to zero in on any gaps between what migrants say to U.S. border agents after they are taken into custody and testimony they provide during the interview process with a trained asylum officer.\"\n\n-- No group has been more hurt than Syrians by the U.S. curtailing refugees. Katie Zezima reports: \"Under the Trump administration, the number of refugees allowed into the United States has fallen to its lowest level since the resettlement program began in 1980. And few groups have been as affected as Syrians, who have been fleeing a brutal civil war that has left hundreds of thousands of people dead since it began in 2011. The number of Syrian refugees allowed into the United States in fiscal 2016 was 12,587. In fiscal 2018, the United States admitted 62.\"\n\n-- \"Self-deportation\" rates among undocumented immigrants have increased under Trump. Politico's Christie Thompson and the Marshall Project's Andrew R. Calderon report: \"The number of immigrants who have applied for voluntary departure has soared since the election of [Trump], according to new Justice Department data obtained by The Marshall Project. In fiscal year 2018, the number of applications doubled from the previous fiscal year -- rising much faster than the 17 percent increase in overall immigration cases, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.\"\n\n-- An Oregon man was sentenced to four months in prison for trying and failing to bribe an ICE officer into deporting his wife. Antonio Oswaldo Burgos and his wife were going through a divorce when authorities say he followed an ICE employee from the agency's Portland office to a parking lot, where Burgos offered the officer money to deport his wife. The officer declined and reported Burgos, who was then prosecuted. (Katie Mettler)\n\n-- Negotiations over a multibillion-dollar disaster aid bill in the Senate have grown more complicated now that the Trump administration wants to add emergency spending for the border. Erica Werner reports: \"But with the $17 billion disaster aid bill among the few legislative vehicles expected to move through Congress anytime soon, administration officials have begun eyeing it to carry some or all of a separate $4.5 billion emergency spending request for the border they sent to Congress last week.\"\n\n-- Trump briefed a dozen Republican senators on the broad contours of his son-in-law Jared Kushner's plan to transform the legal immigration system. Seung Min Kim reports: The proposal is expected to prioritize \"immigrants based on their ability to immediately contribute to the economy. ... Republicans in touch with the White House in recent weeks also said the administration has also looked at modernizing the visa system for temporary guest workers ... and tightening asylum policy ... But changing asylum policy and temporary guest worker programs barely came up in the hour-long meeting at the White House on Tuesday.\"\n\n-- The Republican senators appeared receptive. The AP's Jill Colvin reports: \"A senior administration official told reporters after the meeting that the president had approved the effort to overhaul America's immigration system and increase border security last week and that it should now be considered 'the President Trump plan.' ... The White House is also working with Sen. Lindsey Graham on additional legislation that would address the nation's asylum system in an effort to stem the flow of migrants across the border.\"\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- While researching bankruptcy in the late 1980s, Elizabeth Warren was criticized by fellow academics for overstating her findings. Annie Linskey reports: \"Warren, who with two co-authors had spent six years digging into court files on real-world cases, laid out a provocative argument that Americans were going broke at a faster rate due to predatory credit card companies -- not, as many experts long argued, because of their own irresponsible spending. ... A scathing article by a Rutgers University bankruptcy scholar, Philip Shuchman, appearing in the school's law review, accused Warren and her co-authors of engaging in 'repeated instances of scientific misconduct,' making 'extravagant and false claims' and adopting 'high-level populist theorizing that bears no relation to their research.' ... [The episode] foreshadowed a recurring dynamic in Warren's career as professor, then politician: She introduced pioneering ideas that reshaped views of the middle class, drew criticism that she was overstating her findings to make ideological points, and seemed to relish punching back.\"\n\n-- \"Amy Klobuchar's complicated political inheritance,\" by Ben Terris: \"It's been something of a theme over the course of Amy's life; both an evolving kinship with her father and being mortified by things he put in the paper. For decades, Jim Klobuchar was a daily columnist for the Minneapolis Star Tribune; part sportswriter, raconteur-adventurer, voice for the voiceless, and needler of the ruling class. Little in his life, or Amy's, was off limits. ... Friends of Jim's say they see a lot of him in Amy: the populist streak, the humor, and yes, the reports of a fierce temper. Intentionally or not, being the daughter of an alcoholic has become central to Amy's presidential run.\"\n\n-- Jill Biden said it was \"time to move on\" from her husband's mishandling of Anita Hill's sexual harassment allegation against Clarence Thomas. \"I watched the hearings like most other Americans, and so I mean Joe said, as I did, we believed Anita Hill. He voted against Clarence Thomas,\" the former second lady told NPR. \"And as he has said, I mean he's called Anita Hill, they've talked, they've spoken, and he said, you know, he feels badly. He apologized for the way the hearings were run. And so now it's kind of -- it's time to move on.\" She also defended her husband against allegations of inappropriate touching, saying, \"Joe realizes these are different times. And believe me -- he's very conscious of, you know, how he interacts with men and women today.\"\n\n-- The Trump campaign rebuked \"dishonest fundraising groups\" in a veiled swipe at the president's former deputy campaign manager David Bossie, who's been accused of running a fundraising group that misleads donors about how it is using their money. Felicia Sonmez and Josh Dawsey report: \"'President Trump's campaign condemns any organization that deceptively uses the President's name, likeness, trademarks, or branding and confuses voters,' Trump's campaign said in the message ... The statement includes an appeal to the 'appropriate authorities' to 'investigate all alleged scam groups for potential illegal activities.' ... Despite its stated goal of supporting conservative candidates who back Trump, just 3 percent of the $15.4 million that [Bossie's group] Presidential Coalition spent in 2017 and 2018 went toward direct political activity.\"\n\n-- House Democrats are raking in money from corporate political groups and registered lobbyists, even as their more left-wing members increasingly attempt to distance themselves from those traditional sources of financial support. The Daily Beast's Jackie Kucinich and Lachlan Markay report: \"The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised about $1.93 million from 143 corporate political action committees in the first quarter of 2019, according to a Daily Beast review of campaign finance records. That's up substantially from the past two election cycles. ... Lobbyist fundraisers are also ponying up for the DCCC. In the first three months of the year, eight registered federal lobbyists 'bundled' more than $1.2 million in contributions for the committee. That's nearly double the total during the same period last cycle.\"\n\nDIVIDED AMERICA:\n\n-- \"The racial divide in the Red Sox' visit to Trump's White House is impossible to ignore,\" by Dave Sheinin: Boston Red Sox Manager Alex Cora will not be attending a visit to the White House, and he \"is not the only uniformed Red Sox personnel to opt out of the trip. Among players ... David Price, Christian Vazquez and Hector Velazquez have said they would be declining the invitation. The other roughly 20 players ... have either announced their intention to attend or were presumed to be attending. It was impossible not to notice one significant difference between the two groups: Those opting out of the trip are all people of color, while those planning to attend (with the exception of designated hitter J.D. Martinez, who is of Cuban descent) are white. This dichotomy was highlighted by a tweet from longtime Boston sports columnist Steve Buckley, who noted, 'Basically, it's the white Sox who'll be going.' The racial divide was further underscored when Price, who is African American, retweeted Buckley's tweet to his nearly 1.8 million followers, adding, 'I just feel like more than 38k should see this tweet ...' Price's retweet led to rampant speculation Monday that the racial divide of the White House visit had become a clubhouse problem for the team.\"\n\n-- The Chicago Cubs are investigating a fan who appeared to flash a white-supremacist sign on-air. The fan, in the background of a camera cut to a game analyst, flashed an upside-down \"okay\" sign, a hand gesture that's been adopted as a symbol of white power.

The group, named Shield Wall Network, said it was protesting the controversy surrounding a scholarship at Arkansas Tech University named after a professor who's been accused of being a Holocaust denier. (Courier News)\n\n-- Footage from an Oklahoma police officer's body camera has raised new questions about the shooting of a black teenager who had been playing with a replica gun. Sgt. Kyle Holcomb, who is back at work after being cleared of criminal charges in the March incident, can be heard in the video saying, \"I think it's a cap gun, but they are shooting something off.\" Moments later, he directed the group of boys to drop their toy weapons just before firing off four shots -- two of which hit Lorenzo Clerkley Jr., an eighth-grader who survived the shooting. (Eli Rosenberg)\n\n-- Right-wing agitator Jacob Wohl, the mastermind of the baseless sexual assault smear attempt against Pete Buttigieg, tried to create a fake protest against himself. Wohl and Jack Burkman, one of his allies, were planning on holding a news conference to push the fake allegations against Buttigieg, but the event was canceled after they claimed a protest was being organized against them. A reporter then found that the email account behind the Eventbrite invitation for the protest belongs to Wohl himself.

Anthony Faiola and Karen DeYoung report: \"The European Union called on the Vatican and the United Nations to join talks to defuse tensions. Canada and another nations were seeking to enlist Cuba -- one of Maduro's closest allies -- in finding a peaceful solution. The United States, in an attempt to lure more defectors, lifted sanctions Tuesday on Maduro's spy chief, who last week broke with the socialist leader and fled the country. In Caracas, meanwhile, Maduro's government began to fire back. A week after opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3's failed attempt to lead a military uprising -- senior loyalists were said to be poised to move against Maduro -- the pro-government Supreme Court charged six opposition lawmakers with treason, conspiracy and rebellion, and they were stripped of their parliamentary immunity from prosecution.

China has just informed us that they (Vice-Premier) are now coming to the U.S. to make a deal. We'll see, but I am very happy with over $100 Billion a year in Tariffs filling U.S. coffers...great for U.S., not good for China!\" he added.\n\nMr. Trump's Twitter taunt comes as Chinese negotiators are en route to the United States to try and salvage a trade agreement that has fallen apart in recent days. The comments are likely to inflame tensions as negotiators on both sides prepare to reconvene for several days of meetings aimed at bringing those talks back from the brink. Vice Premier Liu He, one of China's top economic officials and a close confidant of the country's leader, Xi Jinping, will join talks in Washington beginning on Thursday.\n\nBut Mr. Trump appears ready to impose higher tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on Friday morning, regardless of whether the talks get back on track. On Wednesday morning, the United States Trade Representative filed a public notice saying that tariffs on roughly $200 billion of Chinese products would increase to 25 percent from 10 percent on May 10 \"in light of the lack of progress in the additional rounds of negotiations since March 2019.\"\n\nSteady progress between the two countries for a trade deal blew up last weekend, when China called for substantial changes to the negotiating text, and Mr. Trump responded by threatening to raise existing tariffs on $200 billion of products from China, and impose new tariffs on an additional $325 billion of products.\n\n\"Since the meeting on December 1, the United States and China have engaged in additional rounds of negotiation on these issues, including meetings in March, April, and May of 2019,\" the notice read. \"In the most recent negotiations, China has chosen to retreat from specific commitments agreed to in earlier rounds.\"\n\nRobert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, accused China on Monday of reneging on what he described as \"good, firm commitments on eliminating market-distorting subsidies.\"\n\nChina has pushed back. During a routine briefing on Wednesday, Geng Shuang, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, said, \"The Chinese side will not sidestep differences and has sincerity in continuing consultations.\"\n\nThe retrenchment in the talks has come as a surprise to businesses and investors, who believed that the two countries were headed toward a deal that would open Chinese markets to American business, require China to protect intellectual property and result in large purchases of American products. Markets, which fell on Tuesday, were expected to open lower on Wednesday as investors continue to absorb the threat of a prolonged trade war between the world's two largest economies.\n\nBut the two sides had been unable to find common ground on a range of important economic issues. Progress broke down last week after China walked back its commitments, Trump administration officials said.\n\nIn talks last week in Beijing and then in a further exchange of documents at the start of last weekend, Chinese negotiators surprised their American counterparts by calling for changes in the language of all seven chapters of the 150-page draft agreement, people familiar with the negotiations said.

Reuters reports that last Friday, Chinese negotiators submitted a raft of edits to a draft agreement that reversed pledges to make legal changes on core American demands, including \"theft of U.S. intellectual property and trade secrets; forced technology transfers; competition policy; access to financial services; and currency manipulation.\" That appears to have placed considerable distance between the two sides.\n\n\"I would look at this week as a check-the-box meeting,\" one source tells me of this week's negotiations. \"The Chinese are going to show up and focus more on press statements than what's accomplished at the table. And things will play out over the next couple of weeks.\"\n\nOn top of the disagreement over the legal status of Chinese concessions, the Wall Street Journal's Chao Deng and Lingling Wei report, the two sides remain at odds over \"China's subsides to domestic companies and opening key Chinese markets, such as cloud computing,\" among other issues.\n\nAnd the U.S. Chamber of Commerce last week lowered expectations for the agreement by casting doubt on whether the Trump team can make breakthroughs on two key fronts -- Chinese cybertheft and the subsidies that Beijing uses to prop up favored industries.\n\n\"I'm not sure we're going to get all the progress we want,\" Myron Brilliant, the group's executive vice president, told reporters on a conference call.\n\nFlash points aside, China critics see a familiar pattern emerging: That is, that the Chinese never intended to finalize a deal but rather play for time. \"I don't think the Chinese are negotiating in good faith,\" says Peter Morici, an economist and professor emeritus at the University of Maryland. \"We could have an agreement in a week if they would. But [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] has his own internal pressures. He's feeling pressure at home, so he's starting to back away.\"\n\nOne potentially encouraging signal from across the Pacific: Beijing is still sending Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, its top negotiator, to Washington this week, a move in doubt after President Trump's Sunday tweets threatening to massively dial up tariffs.\n\n\"To me, the fact that the Chinese are still coming with Liu He at the head means there's some possibility they could have a marathon session on Thursday, break through whatever these problems are and get themselves somewhere,\" says Claire Reade, senior counsel at Arnold & Porter in Washington and a former assistant U.S. trade representative for China.\n\nReade presented the bull case for the recent Chinese balk, floating the possibility it represented \"one last concession to the hawk side in China\" to gauge the U.S. reaction. \"It seems conceivable that the Chinese didn't expect the U.S. to respond with such vehemence. Sometimes the Chinese need to demonstrate to their own constituencies that certain positions aren't viable.\"\n\nA former State Department official says the Trump team is guilty of its own miscalculations about the Chinese. Brian Klein, who was posted in Beijing, said the administration is assuming too much about the impact of tariffs on the Chinese economy and Xi's appetite for a deal, per my colleagues David Nakamura and Ashley Parker. \"There's little sign that the Chinese economy is being dramatically damaged,\" Klein, who operates Decision Analytics, a New York-based risk management consulting firm, tells them.\n\nWhere would that leave the two sides as they prepare to reconvene this week? \"We really don't know, and what will be revealing is what happens on Thursday.\"\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\n-- Trump trade moves could threaten his reelection. The Post's Toluse Olorunnipa and Seung Min Kim: \"As Trump prepares to run on the economy, his threat to increase tariffs on imports from China has sent the stock market diving and undercut a stretch of positive economic news. U.S. farmers and exporters, already bearing the brunt of China's retaliatory tariffs, now face the prospect of an escalated trade war in which states that Trump needs to win reelection will be in the crosshairs.\n\n\"The trade war has also exposed a rift inside the White House and among the president's allies -- with some officials pushing for a quick resolution to calm the markets ahead of 2020, and others warning the president that a weak deal with China could leave him politically vulnerable.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and top economic advisor Larry Kudlow are urging a swift resolution to avoid 2020 blowback, Toluse and Seung Min report.\n\nCompanies scramble to prepare for new tariffs. Politico's Doug Palmer and Adam Behsudi: \"U.S. companies are bracing for a huge jump in costs as tariffs on $200 billion worth of consumer products and other goods from China are set to more than double on Friday per [Trump's] orders... The second, $200 billion list includes many consumer goods. They range from low-value items like dog leashes, toothbrushes and toilet paper to pricier goods like barbecue grills, vacuum cleaners, freezers, refrigerators and furniture... Most manufacturers, suppliers and business groups are warning that it is their members, and their American customers, who will shoulder the brunt of the tariffs.\n\nDimon: 80 percent chance of a deal, eventually. Bloomberg's Sam Mamudi and Stephen Engle report the JPMorgan Chase CEO predicts \"it remains probable there will eventually be an agreement. He said, however, that global growth would be hit if the talks go 'really south.' 'Now we have this whole kind of little bump in the road,' said Dimon. 'Sometimes his tweets don't pan out to be as bad. I don't think they'll get the deal done by Friday.'\"\n\n-- You say tomato and I say ta-riff? Starting on Tuesday, the United States imposed a 17.5 percent tariff on Mexican tomato imports. My colleague Laura Reiley reports \"economists say that could lead to shortages and price increases of up to 85 percent as soon as this winter.\" The tariff follows the demise of a 22-year-old agreement that sought to \"maintain the peace between American and Mexican tomato growers.\"\n\n-- Trump lost more than $1 billion between 1985 and 1994. The New York Times investigative team that brought you the Pulitzer-prize winning blockbuster about Trump's tax avoidance schemes last year dropped another bombshell Tuesday night.\n\nThe paper obtained printouts of Trump's IRS tax transcripts that show he was hardly the profit-minting business whiz he presented to the public: \"The numbers show that in 1985, Mr. Trump reported losses of $46.1 million from his core businesses -- largely casinos, hotels and retail space in apartment buildings. They continued to lose money every year, totaling $1.17 billion in losses for the decade.\"\n\nThis detail in particular lit up Twitter. Look for it to reappear on the Democratic presidential campaign trail: \"In fact, year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer, The Times found when it compared his results with detailed information the I.R.S. compiles on an annual sampling of high-income earners. His core business losses in 1990 and 1991 -- more than $250 million each year -- were more than double those of the nearest taxpayers in the I.R.S. information for those years.\"\n\nTrump, predictably, responded on Twitter this morning:\n\n-- Mnuchin addresses Trump fundraiser. The Post's Michelle Ye Hee Lee, Josh Dawsey and Damian Paletta: \"Mnuchin addressed a group of top donors backing [Trump's] reelection Tuesday evening, making an unusual political appearance at a gathering that included industry executives his agency is tasked with regulating. Mnuchin's attendance at the kickoff event for the Trump Victory Committee came a day after he rejected a request from House Democrats for Trump's tax returns...\n\n\"Among those who were invited was Trump friend and billionaire Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of the private equity giant Blackstone Group, who did not attend, according to a person familiar with the invitation. Treasury secretaries in recent years have avoided attending fundraiser events with people they could be tasked with regulating, in part because of their unique role in overseeing a broad swath of companies in the financial system.\"\n\n-- Stocks tank. A day after investors largely shrugged at mounting trade tensions between the U.S. and China, stocks registered a delayed reaction Tuesday, with the S&P 500 shedding 1.65 percent. The Post's Thomas Heath: \"The sell-off was broad and deep, reaching into technology, chips, industrials and materials. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 473 points, about 1.8 percent, to close at 25,965. The blue chip measure was down 648 points at its low. All 30 Dow components were in the red, with aerospace giant Boeing the biggest drag after a downgrade by Barclays...\n\n\"The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as the 'fear gauge,' rose to its highest point since January, a sign that Wall Street is throwing a mini-tantrum over Trump's trade policies.\"\n\nBy one measure, the route was worse than the Christmas Eve selloff that nearly pitched stocks into a bear market. Bloomberg's Elena Popina: \"It's not the size of the decline but the speed with which investors are hitting sell buttons. At one point today some 89 percent of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange traded in the red, surpassing the threshold reached Dec. 24, when a 2.7 percent rout in the S&P 500 pushed the gauge to a 20-month low. During the December correction, the volume of stocks trading down was higher just on one other day, Dec. 4.\"\n\n-- Clarida: No rate cuts coming. Bloomberg's Christopher Condon and Rich Miller: \"Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida pushed back against speculation in financial markets the central bank will cut interest rates to boost softening inflation up to its 2 percent target. 'I don't think we're at that place now,' Clarida said Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg Television...\n\n\"His remarks were later backed up by comments from Fed Governor Randal Quarles, who played down concern over weak inflation. Clarida also echoed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's take that transitory factors had contributed to the most recent dip in inflation, and declared the U.S. economy and monetary policy were in 'a good place.'\"\n\n-- Uber and Lyft drivers plan protest for today: \"Getting an Uber or a Lyft may be impossible -- or take longer and cost more -- Wednesday when drivers for both companies plan to strike in major U.S. cities to protest what they say are unfair wages and poor working conditions,\" my colleague Luz Lazo reports. \"Thousands of drivers in at least eight cities -- including Los Angeles, New York and Washington -- are planning to shut off their apps and join rallies outside company headquarters and regional offices, according to labor organizers.\" The protests occur just days before Uber's initial public offering, which CNBC's Lauren Feiner writes \"is expected to be the largest among new tech stock debuts this year with an expected valuation of $80.53 billion to $91.51 billion on a fully diluted basis.\"\n\nNews you can use: Luz reports that in the DMV, \"officials said they were working with taxi dispatch teams at Reagan National and Dulles International airports to ensure that extra taxis were available in the event of increased demand Wednesday.\"\n\nLyft, whose IPO was just weeks ago, reported \"strong revenue growth but substantial losses in its first quarterly earnings report since its rocky stock market debut,\" the Associated Press's Cathy Bussewitz wrote last night.\n\nSpeaking of Uber, the Wall Street Journal's Julie Jargon has a fascinating story on ride-hailing apps that are appealing to working parents by marketing themselves as a way to ferry kids between school, extracurriculars and back home. Uber and Lyft technically have policies against allowing unaccompanied minors to use the apps, but some parents told Jargon that their kids do so without difficulty.\n\nIt's by now a dated joke to say an app is Uber but for ..., yet there appears to be genuine interest in this type of service. The obvious concern is safety and security. Uber itself tested a program for minor riders in three cities in 2017 but declined to tell the Journal if it will roll out a larger program.\n\n-- Boeing continues to get hammered. Boeing stock continued to fall Tuesday, Bloomberg News's Ryan Vlastelica reports, \"after Barclays Capital downgraded the stock, writing that Wall Street was still underestimating the fallout that would occur as a result of the deadly 737 Max crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.\" 'We expect the recovery of 737 Max production to take longer than expected,' and fliers' desire to avoid the aircraft is \"likely worse than anticipated,' analyst David Strauss wrote, lowering his investment rating to equal weight from overweight. The price target fell to $367 from $417.\" It might not be over yet: There's another hearing on the Hill today about 737 Max, featuring testimony from the FAA and NTSB heads.\n\n-- Corporate PACs and lobbyist find a new (old) home for their campaign dollars: Cast out by many in the sprawling Democratic presidential campaign, corporate PACs and registered lobbyists are flocking to the newly empowered House Democrats' campaign arm as a way to continue to flex their financial muscle, the Daily Beast's Jackie Kucinich and Lachlan Markay report. The DCCC \"raised about $1.93 million from 143 corporate political action committees in the first quarter of 2019, according to a Daily Beast review of campaign finance records.\" Kucinich and Markay report that is a substantial increase from previous election cycles. \"In the first quarter of 2017, for example, 103 such PACs donated $1.32 million to the DCCC. Two years earlier, 101 of them gave $1.15 million to the committee.\"\n\nIn terms of lobbyists, the pair report that \"in the first three months of the year, eight registered federal lobbyists \"bundled\" more than $1.2 million in contributions for the committee. That's nearly double the total during the same period last cycle, and nearly 40 times the DCCC's lobbyist bundling haul during the entire first half of 2015.\"\n\nRemember: My colleague James Hohmann scooped in The Daily 202 last week that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wants to do more to attract Democrats. That news comes as the Koch network is also sought to strike a more bipartisan tone. Together, the evidence is clear that the broader Washington ecosystem is taking notice of the first Democratic House majority since 2010. The question now is how much the base will tolerate.\n\nThe Post's Maura Judkis tried Mayomust, Mayocue and Kranch.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) By Arnold Kamler Arnold Kamler is the chairman and CEO of Kent International, Inc., based in Parsippany, New Jersey. May 8 at 6:00 AM\n\nMy family has been in the bicycle business since 1907, when my grandfather opened a shop on New York's Lower East Side. That tradition continued in 1950, when my father started our company as a bicycles and accessories wholesaler. Today, we are one of the largest suppliers of imported and American-made bicycles in the country. Over the generations, we've weathered all kinds of turns in the industry. But we've never dealt with anything like this: heavy tariffs on key commodities, announced with barely any notice, by a president who may or may not be bluffing.\n\nThough the bulk of my business comes from imported bikes, I also own and operate a bicycle assembly factory in Manning, S.C., which produces one of our lines, BCA Bikes. When we opened our doors in 2014, initially hiring 47 employees, we were bucking the overall trend in our industry: More than 95 percent of all bicycles sold in the United States are manufactured in China. With labor costs there rising, and high employee turnover, we decided to make an investment in our long-term growth. Today, our factory is responsible for more than 50 percent of the 625,000 bicycles produced in the United States each year. Before President Trump's trade war, we had plans to grow even further.\n\nAlmost all of our parts are made in China: Saving on their manufacture has enabled us to hire American workers and offer them good wages and excellent health benefits. We were already paying duties of 4 to 10 percent when the Trump administration announced in 2018 that it would impose an additional 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods. We couldn't simply pick up and buy from makers in other countries. Though the United States once had a substantial bicycle parts industry, those companies were wiped out in the early 1990s. Our business partners in China have decades of experience making the parts we need. We source very carefully, and we can't afford to gamble on quality or safety.\n\n[Farmers like me put Trump in office. Now his trade war is smothering us.]\n\nMy company specializes in providing affordable bicycles, retailing for between $80 and $200 at places including Walmart, Amazon and Academy Sporting Goods. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) The new tariff raised our overall costs by 7.5 percent, which we were forced to pass on to our customers, and ultimately, to American consumers. Because it typically takes several months for large retailers to accept a price increase, we couldn't offset our extra costs for much of our busiest shipping season, in late fall. When the holidays arrived, consumers were put off by the price increases. Sales dropped, ending up 5 to 10 percent lower than our projections\n\nThe administration's abrupt policy shifts alone have caused damage. When Trump first threatened to increase tariffs to 25 percent, everyone -- including our suppliers -- wanted to get their products to the United States before they were scheduled to take effect. Ocean freight carriers increased prices dramatically. The administration eventually backed off on the threat and didn't raise those tariffs. But we had more than $1.5 million in additional freight costs, which we couldn't recoup. Running a business requires adapting to adversity; these sudden changes came like a punch to the gut.\n\nNow Trump has renewed his threat to increase tariffs to 25 percent Friday -- a ridiculously short time frame that leaves us little time to react. I don't belong to either political party, and I've voted for candidates from both. I understand very well that China has been cheating in all kinds of trade situations, from state subsidies to cybertheft. But -- contrary to the president's tweets this weekend -- when the government levies tariffs, we Americans are the ones who end up paying. In fact, the U.S. economy suffered a net loss of $7.8 billion a year thanks to the trade war, according to a recent study. Ironically, workers in Republican counties have shouldered most of those costs, mostly in the form of retaliatory tariffs against the agricultural sector.\n\nThe volatility caused by the trade war has thrown a wrench in my company's domestic ambitions. Ever since our factory opened, I have planned to bring more phases of the manufacturing process home. We'd start by importing steel tubes, and welding the frames ourselves; from there, we'd buy American steel and make the tubes. Our factory employs 125 people, but that could grow to 300, I thought: Eventually, we could build 1 million bicycles, right here in the United States. But Trump's protectionist measures are getting in our way. We don't plan to lay anyone off, but until the situation stabilizes, and we have some clarity about our future, we'll just continue buying bike frames from China.\n\nThese tariffs could go into effect Friday, as threatened, or they could be put off for weeks. They could last for a few months or take hold permanently. Trump could be dead serious, or this could be a heavy-handed negotiating ploy that he will have to back down from. There's no way for us to know -- we'll just have to endure the upheaval. My company created hundreds of good, steady jobs in South Carolina and at our headquarters in New Jersey -- but despite the president's promises that he would help American companies grow, his sanctions are hurting us badly. These measures punish American businesses that have done nothing wrong. We play by the rules; this administration keeps changing them.\n\nAs told to Post editor Sophia Nguyen.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Dz-Ah56Ku2VG0pP6O2xS7AW2dlI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/K2ADCDDRBUI6TEZRGC6FQNXURY.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 295007100}, {"uri": "1130579849", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-07", "time": "23:57:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-07T23:57:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trade-war-threatens-to-roil-2020-race-as-republicans-complain-about-the-tariffs-trump-loves/2019/05/07/d8697ea4-70d5-11e9-8be0-ca575670e91c_story.html", "title": "Trade war threatens to roil 2020 race as Republicans complain about the tariffs Trump loves", "body": "By Toluse Olorunnipa and Toluse Olorunnipa White House reporter Seung Min Kim Seung Min Kim White House reporter May 7 at 7:50 PM\n\nPresident Trump's aggressive trade policies are running headlong into his campaign for reelection.\n\nAs Trump prepares to run on the economy, his threat to increase tariffs on imports from China has sent the stock market diving and served to undercut a stretch of positive economic news. U.S. farmers and exporters, already bearing the brunt of China's retaliatory tariffs, now face the prospect of an escalated trade war in which key states that Trump needs to win reelection will be in the crosshairs.\n\nThe trade war has also exposed a rift inside the White House and among the president's allies -- with some officials pushing for a quick resolution to calm the markets ahead of 2020, and others warning the president that a weak deal with China could leave him politically vulnerable.\n\n\"My warning has been, we don't want the 2020 election year to become greatly intensified friction with China over trade issues. We want a deal that works,\" said Michael Pillsbury, a China expert at the Hudson Institute who has advised the Trump administration on trade. \"One way to unite all 21 Democratic primary candidates is if the president gets a quick but flawed deal that inevitably leads to friction when China is caught cheating next year.\"\n\nHowever, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow are among a group of Trump aides who have encouraged the president to quickly reach a deal with China and avoid political blowback from a full-scale trade war in 2020, according to people familiar with the internal debate.\n\nWhite House officials said Trump is prepared to take a hard line with China going into 2020 in part because he intends to keep his 2016 campaign promise to fix what he views as bad trade deals. Trump believes strongly in the power of tariffs to force China and other countries to negotiate and won't sign a deal for political expediency, said two officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average lost 473 points on May 7 and was down by as much as 600 points in interday trading as markets continued to react to uncertainty surrounding trade negotiations between the United States and China. (Justin Lane/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nThe two officials also played down the extent of disagreement within the administration, saying top advisers are mostly in agreement about the need to take on China over its unfair trade practices.\n\nTrump's trade agenda is likely to play a central role in the 2020 race, as Democrats seek to challenge the president's economic message and compete with him in export-reliant states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The president is also struggling to build support in Congress for his renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement, with some Republican lawmakers objecting to the continued use of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from U.S. allies.\n\nSome Democratic presidential candidates are using turbulence around the trade talks to needle Trump and try to undercut his messaging on the economy.\n\n\"This is what happens when he tries to go at it alone and he has no leverage,\" Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) said in an interview. \"So he has to create this kind of leverage through a tweet. We should be sitting at that table with our allies.\"\n\nTrump campaign officials recently polled trade messaging in a multistate survey, according to people familiar with the matter. Trade and immigration are likely to be two themes on which the president focuses as he ramps up his campaign in the coming months, officials said.\n\nPresident Trump watches as Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, left, speaks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer, right, at the White House on Feb. 22, 2019. (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTrade talks between the United States and China faltered this week as Trump publicly voiced his frustration by announcing plans for new tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\n\"The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate,\" Trump tweeted Sunday, after threatening to levy tariffs on all imports of Chinese goods. \"No!\"\n\nU.S. officials accused China of reneging on prior commitments in the talks, which have included 10 rounds over the past year. In meetings in Washington and Beijing, the Trump administration has been pushing for significant concessions from the Chinese on issues including market access, intellectual property rights and the trade deficit.\n\nRobert E. Lighthizer, the president's chief trade negotiator, told reporters Monday that though Chinese officials have walked back their previous commitments, the U.S. is still planning to move forward with talks. The administration expects to host Chinese Vice Premier Liu He to continue discussions in Washington this week.\n\nTrump has credited his previous tariffs with bringing Beijing to the table, but China has retaliated by slapping tariffs on U.S. agricultural products. Those tariffs and other retaliatory levies from the European Union, Canada and Mexico have sent economic shock waves through communities that helped Trump secure his 2016 victory.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have increasingly voiced concerns to the White House about the president's trade policy and the impact of tariffs on their states.\n\nThough many praise Trump for his tough-on-China stance, they also say patience is wearing thin and that the president risks losing the backing of farmers in key presidential swing states.\n\n\"If he gets a deal, awesome. If he doesn't, it's gonna hurt,\" said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who is up for reelection next year in a state that Trump won in 2016. Farmers are \"losing their patience, yeah, but they want to see a deal.\"\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said that Republican senators have tried to make the political argument against tariffs but that it seemed fall on deaf ears.\n\n\"I just think he believes that farmers are going to be with him because they think he's doing the right thing,\" Thune said. \"And by and large, that's true. But when you start losing the farm, that calculation starts to change a little bit.\"\n\nWhen Vice President Pence attended the Senate GOP lunch Tuesday, he got an earful from senators who complained about the political ramifications of Trump's trade approach, said Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.).\n\n\"There's a lot of feeling in farm country we're being used as pawns in this whole business,\" he said. \"We will benefit tremendously if we get a good deal, so we're hanging in there with the president. As opposed to hanging separately.\"\n\nPence encouraged the senators to stick with Trump, who has publicly complained about a lack of unity in his party as he tries to negotiate trade agreements.\n\nTrump's campaign advisers expressed confidence that the president's trade policies will help him connect with voters in Rust Belt states that have lost manufacturing jobs to China.\n\n\"Unlike his predecessors, President Trump has demonstrated that he has the courage to take on China's unfair trade practices,\" Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement that singled out former vice president Joe Biden for saying China was \"not competition\" for the United States. \"While other administrations have talked a good game about confronting China, President Trump has been working on a deal to stop China from stealing intellectual property, forcing transfer of technology, manipulating currency, and dumping steel into the market.\"\n\nTrump had previously said trade talks were going well and that he was on track to hold a face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to finalize the deal. Those positive comments coincided with a soaring stock market in recent weeks.\n\nBut White House officials said Trump has grown frustrated at times that a deal with China has not been struck. Once he received word from trade officials in recent days that talks were unlikely to come to a resolution soon on terms the United States wanted, he decided to impose new tariffs, thinking that doing so would force China back to the table.\n\nOne official said Trump is aware that he needs a deal before 2020 to hold onto support from farmers in the Midwest.\n\nThe president repeatedly boasts to advisers that his tough approach is hurting the Chinese economy -- and that Beijing's standing in the world is falling -- even as some officials and advisers close to him worry that the Chinese are negotiating from a stronger position politically. But there is also disagreement within the White House about how much economic pain the United States can stomach before the trade battles blow back on the president politically.\n\n\"They're scared of the market going down, since it could undercut the president's claim of boosting the economy so much,\" Pillsbury said.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 473 points, or 1.8 percent, on Tuesday as investors weighed the prospect of Trump's following through on his threat to increase tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent on $200 billion in Chinese goods. Trump has closely watched the markets and tracked the impact of his policies on stocks.\n\nThe president has claimed that the strong economy gives him leverage to push for a comprehensive deal with China. The U.S. economy grew in the first quarter at a surprisingly robust rate of 3.2 percent, and the unemployment rate fell last month to its lowest point in nearly 50 years.\n\nDan DiMicco, a former steel executive and trade adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign, said the president's base wants him to maintain a tough position on trade, even if it causes some short-term economic head winds.\n\n\"He believes that this trade issue is as important as the economy because they're totally related,\" he said. \"He's going to be running on both.\"\n\nJosh Dawsey, Ashley Parker and Erica Werner contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1uQJMGZum1GGoqZxHcs0kFK4qAk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IGQT42DRDII6TC7AZJLVM4HJDQ.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4770178", "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 294969420}, {"uri": "1130539603", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-07", "time": "22:35:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-07T22:35:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8588235378265381, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/theres-too-much-at-stake-for-trump-to-leave-the-pentagon-in-limbo/2019/05/07/9b4295b4-70f4-11e9-9f06-5fc2ee80027a_story.html", "title": "Opinion | There's too much at stake for Trump to leave the Pentagon in limbo", "body": "By David Ignatius David Ignatius Columnist covering foreign affairs Columnist May 7 at 6:17 PM\n\nAt a time when the United States is facing a potential military confrontation with Iran, an escalating trade war with China and a showdown with North Korea, you'd think President Trump would want a permanent secretary of defense to oversee Pentagon plans.\n\nBut Patrick Shanahan is still cooling his heels as acting secretary, awaiting a formal nomination that was expected nearly two weeks ago, after Shanahan was cleared in a conflict-of-interest probe. The nomination sits and waits, and some prominent Trump supporters who back Shanahan are beginning to voice concerns.\n\nNewt Gingrich, former House speaker and a Trump confidant, told me Tuesday he thinks Shanahan would be a \"very\" good defense secretary and added: \"I hope the president will nominate Shanahan as quickly as possible. It will strengthen Shanahan's hand in reforming the Pentagon bureaucracy.\"\n\nJack Keane, a Trump adviser and retired Army general who could probably have had the Pentagon job himself if he'd wanted it, says he's also mystified by the delay. Asked whether Shanahan should be nominated, Keane said, \"I definitely think so,\" because it would boost his standing in dealing with allies and potential adversaries.\n\nKeane explained: \"In my discussions with [Shanahan], I'm convinced he understands the issues and is seized with the urgency to reform the department.\" Gingrich offered a similar assessment of Shanahan as a potential change agent: \"Shanahan has a clear vision of the technology investments needed to maintain superiority over the Chinese military and the management experience with big systems to turn that vision into reality.\"\n\nSo why, at a time when Shanahan is gaining Republican support after a somewhat tepid initial reaction, is the president waiting? As with so many aspects of Trump's behavior, it's a mystery. Maybe he thinks the optics aren't right, given that Shanahan was a former top executive at Boeing, a company that's now mired in controversy over the 737 Max airliner. Perhaps he wants a bigger name that will add luster to his administration.\n\nOr maybe, as Trump has shown in his treatment of former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, former homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and former defense secretary Jim Mattis, the president just likes to keep people dangling in limbo, to the point of personal humiliation.\n\nWhatever the reason, the White House's reluctance to designate a permanent successor to Mattis is threatening to become a Trump \"moment,\" adding to speculation about uncertain presidential decision-making at a time when he has big national security problems accumulating in a wobbly stack that includes Iran, China and North Korea -- not to mention Russia, Venezuela, Turkey and Syria.\n\nShanahan's priorities, should he be nominated and confirmed, seem clear. The former Boeing production engineer wants to consolidate and modernize a Pentagon bureaucracy that's notoriously stove-piped and resistant to change. In setting his tentative agenda, he has worked closely with Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the widely respected chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThe approach Dunford and Shanahan have discussed would seek to better coordinate the geographical nodes, known as combatant commands, that now dominate resources and planning. Rather than segmenting the world through these regional commands, the aim would be to focus more top-level attention on China and Russia, the global strategic priorities. Shanahan wants senior leaders to devote at least 10 percent of their time collectively to China, and 10 percent to Russia.\n\nDunford described the global planning effort during an interview on April 25. Without explicitly endorsing Shanahan, he said that the acting secretary's management experience would be a plus in reforming past practices at the Pentagon. \"The only way you can drive a cultural change in the Pentagon is if the secretary of defense makes it a priority. Shanahan came in without any baggage about how we used to do things. .\u2009.\u2009. As a business executive, he's interested in outcomes.\"\n\nShanahan faced considerable skepticism when he was named acting secretary in December. Critics worried that he lacked Mattis's military experience and personal stature -- and a willingness to push back against Trump, when necessary. Those questions persist, but Shanahan has won some converts among those, such as Gingrich and Keane, who favor modernizing the Pentagon's hidebound systems and its preservation of legacy weapons.\n\nShanahan's boosters argue that he is a tough manager who's willing to knock heads and who understands the technologies -- from space systems to artificial intelligence to cloud computing -- that will be central to any Pentagon transformation.\n\nBut after more than four months with a vacancy at the top of the Pentagon, the biggest argument in Shanahan's favor is simply that the United States needs a defense secretary -- now.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\nThe Post's View: The problem with Trump's 'help wanted' administration\n\nJennifer Rubin: Run government like a business?

Nope", "body": "President Trump says that his protectionist trade policies have accelerated economic growth, but little evidence supports that claim.\n\nPresident Trump threatened over the weekend to re-escalate his trade war with China, by raising tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports. He implied the move would not hurt the American economy and said that the tariffs he has already imposed \"are partially responsible for our great economic results\" in the United States.\n\nAlmost no evidence supports his claims.\n\nMr. Trump's advisers expanded the argument on Monday, saying that the 3.2 percent economic growth recorded in the first quarter of this year -- including a positive contribution from exports -- is proof that the president's hard-line trade policies are helping the economy.\n\n\"There's no question that some of the trade policies helped in the G.D.P. number,\" said Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.\n\nTechnically speaking, the secretary is right: Net exports added to growth in the first quarter, according to the preliminary number the Commerce Department released last month. But that is not an indication that tariffs are helping the economy overall.\n\nThe fact that Mr. Trump and his team appear to believe otherwise could be a smart negotiating tactic with China -- it could give credence to the idea that they are prepared to escalate the trade war further if their demands are not met.\n\nBut claiming to have a stronger economic hand could also undermine Mr. Trump's position and set the economy -- and financial markets -- up for an unpleasant surprise if his bluff is called.\n\nHere's why.\n\nTrade hurt economic growth in 2018\n\nThe formula for calculating the size of the American economy, gross domestic product, is deceptively simple. It combines a number of economic metrics, including consumer spending, business investment and government spending. And it also factors in the difference between the value of what the United States exports and what it imports.\n\nFor more than 40 years, that difference has been negative as America bought more foreign goods and services than it sold. Imports exceeded exports, which means, technically speaking, that America's G.D.P. was lower because of trade.\n\nThis is an accounting relationship, called the trade balance, and it does not tell the full story of economic activity. If consumers are paying a lot to import an amazing new widget from abroad, which American manufacturers cannot or will not produce, they are getting a benefit from that, even though the increase in imports hurts the growth number. There are multiple factors for why the size of the trade balance fluctuates, including the relative strength of trading partners' economies and currencies -- and how much money people spend or save in different countries.\n\nIt is counterintuitive, but the trade balance can still help economic growth, year to year, even if it is reducing the overall size of the economy. The deficit just needs to be smaller than it was the year before -- less of a drag, if you will. A shrinking trade deficit added to G.D.P. growth as recently as 2013. (It also added during the recession years of 2008 and 2009, another sign of caution for celebrating changes in the trade balance.)\n\nMr. Trump hates the trade deficit, and he has repeatedly said that his tariffs will reduce it. In 2018, they did not. The deficit hit a nominal record. It subtracted two-tenths of a percentage point from G.D.P. growth, the Commerce Department calculated.\n\nThe boost from trade in the first quarter looks like a blip\n\nMr. Mnuchin is right that trade made a positive contribution to growth in the first quarter of this year. Preliminary numbers show net exports added a full percentage point to growth.\n\nBut Mr. Trump would be wise to view that number as more of a fluke than a trend, for several reasons.\n\nFor starters, it is preliminary. The Census Bureau has not yet reported trade statistics for March; the most detailed numbers out so far are through February. Growth numbers are notoriously volatile and subject to revision.\n\nMore important, the trade balance seems to have been helped by special circumstances, many of them related to Mr. Trump's trade war. Last year, as retaliation for Mr. Trump's tariffs, China stopped buying soybeans from American farmers. That resulted in a big hit to American soybean exports. But as the two countries resumed trade talks, the Chinese restarted some soybean purchases as a good faith measure.\n\nYou can see that restart in the first-quarter data. Exports of \"food, feed and beverages,\" which include soybeans, jumped 45 percent, after falling by nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018. That category by itself accounted for nearly two-thirds of the growth in exported goods.\n\nThere is a similar pattern when it comes to imports. They surged in the middle of last year, in part because American retailers, manufacturers and consumers were stocking up on Chinese products that might be subject to tariffs, before the tax went into effect. In the first quarter, once the tariffs were in place, they dramatically slowed their buying pace.\n\nEconomic forecasters expect both imports and exports to snap back to more typical trends going forward. The Atlanta Fed's G.D.P. Nowcast sees net exports turning essentially neutral in the second quarter.\n\nTariff revenues aren't stimulating economic activity\n\nThis seems like a no-brainer, but it might need to be said: When the government collects money from tariffs, that money does not immediately translate into economic stimulus. There is no policy that, say, directly pipes cash into a highway fund from Customs, or to taxpayers from a refund check. We are not just snatching money from China and blowing it on tank tops for everyone at American Apparel.\n\nMost economists argue the opposite -- that tariffs reduce economic activity by raising prices for consumers. That reduction thus far from the China tariffs is most likely small, but it is, in those calculations, almost certainly a reduction, and not a boost.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump's proclamations, \"China\" is not paying the cost of the tariffs. Businesses and consumers -- mostly Americans -- are, like the owner and customers of your friendly neighborhood lighting showroom. Also, tariffs have not had a huge impact on prices yet, but not because China is bearing them, but because, thus far, the additional taxes Mr. Trump has imposed on Chinese imports have not been large enough to budge the inflation rate more than a tenth of a percentage point.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco estimates that Mr. Trump's initial wave of China tariffs raised consumer prices by 0.1 percentage points -- and that a second wave would quadruple that effect. That means if Mr. Trump follows through and raises tariff rates, the pain could be much more noticeable to shoppers.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_tankersley@nytimes.com", "name": "Jim Tankersley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/07/business/07DC-TARRIFFEXPLAINER-01/07DC-TARRIFFEXPLAINER-01-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4770178", "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 294946200}, {"uri": "1130229824", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-07", "time": "14:36:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-07T14:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/07/more-challengers-please/", "title": "Opinion | Tillis and others tried to mollify Trump and wound up pleasing no one", "body": "Sen.

Scott Applewhite/AP) By Jennifer Rubin Jennifer Rubin Opinion writer covering politics and policy, foreign and domestic Opinion writer May 7 at 10:15 AM\n\nThe News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C., reports:\n\nSen. Thom Tillis has drawn a Republican challenger in 2020.\n\nGarland Tucker III, the retired chairman and CEO of Triangle Capital Corporation and an author, filed paperwork with the Federal Election Committee to run in the Republican primary on Monday. Tucker wrote \"Conservative Heroes: Fourteen Leaders Who Changed America -- Jefferson to Reagan\" and has served on the board of the John Locke Foundation and the Raleigh-based Civitas Institute.\n\nTillis (R-N.C.) infamously flip-flopped on the president's phony emergency declaration -- writing an op-ed in The Post in support of nullifying it and then reversing course to support the president's naked power grab. Beyond that, Tillis has been among the many passive go-alongers in the GOP, voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act, voting for the unpopular tax plan that surely didn't pay for itself and rubber-stamping a slew of nominees who were subsequently forced out for ethical problems or plain incompetence. He's had a few moments of political independence -- supporting a measure to protect the special counsel, favoring a more reasonable line on immigration -- but never took action to force a showdown with the president, even when the president's Trump's actions harmed Tillis's constituents. (Claw back trade authority to end the fruitless trade war? Nope.)\n\nTillis may now draw primary challengers from the right-wing of the GOP (e.g., rabid anti-immigrant advocates) as well as more moderate Republicans who challenge Trump's disastrous foreign policy management, climate change denial and protectionism.\n\nShould Tillis move right to secure a primary win, he'll be left scrambling to return to the center for the general election. There he'll face charges of flip-flopping and vilified for enabling an erratic, unfit president.\n\nTillis's biggest problem will be running with Trump at the top of the ticket. Provided Democrats don't blow it with a unelectable nominee, North Carolina will be a key battleground state and a place to re-energize African American voters. Like it or not, Tillis is going to be joined at the hip with Trump and held to account for failing to take on the latter's racism, corruption and trade wars.\n\nVulnerable Senate Republicans (e.g., Sens. Joni Ernst of Iowa, Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado) should be on notice: They can never be loyal enough (e.g., Collins on health care) to prevent a Trumpian challenge but as they try to mollify the right (e.g., Gardner voting down the line on Trump's agenda), they anger moderates in their states who helped elect them. (Collins's poll numbers have sunk since her vote to confirm Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.) They've tried to have it every which way and wind up pleasing no one while enraging Democrats.\n\nInstead of doing everything in their power to check Trump's excesses and/or make a second term untenable, they've paved the way for a nominee at the top of the ticket who's likely to drag them under.\n\nThe smart play for Sens. Tillis, Ernst, Collins and Gardner would be to back efforts to enforce subpoenas against Trump and his cronies, demand production of Trump's tax returns and insist on divestiture of his businesses. In other words, the more pressure they can put on Trump not to run again or to encourage a viable challenger, the better. The more they are seen as fighting against power grabs, the easier to separate themselves from a toxic president.\n\nIn sum, the best way for Senate Republicans to hold onto their seats is to chase Trump from the race or at least be seen as willing to take on his most disagreeable views, rhetoric and policies. Trying to mollify him while periodically acting on principle doesn't seem like a winning strategy.\n\nThom Tillis: I support Trump's vision on border security.

He Overshot.", "body": "Mr. Lian is a former lead writer and chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal.\n\nThe endgame in the trade war between China and the United States seems near. President Trump, betting with real currency -- American strength -- apparently has the upper hand, and the concessions President Xi Jinping is likely to make won't be mere tokens. When -- if? -- an agreement is finally announced, Mr. Trump will surely fire off bragging tweets, partly to shore up his credentials for a second term, amid personal and policy troubles. For Mr. Xi, almost any deal could mean a very serious loss of face.\n\nMr. Xi assumed power when China was still riding high on its so-called economic miracle (and the United States remained mired in the aftereffects of the 2008-9 recession). He became general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.) in late 2012 and president of the People's Republic in early 2013. His anticorruption campaign was instantly popular. He championed the \"Chinese Dream,\" a vague vision of prosperity, strength and well-being for the country and its people, that seemed to fire up many citizens. His proposal to President Barack Obama to establish a \"New Model of Major Country Relations\" could only please Han-majority Chinese with imperial yearnings.\n\nBut those were easy stunts, performed in a country with no audible opposition and that bans \"reckless\" talk about the government. The trade war, on the other hand, is the first real occasion to assess Mr. Xi's leadership capabilities. And his performance might not look so good, even if one discounts the setbacks related to the trade war.\n\nFirst and foremost, Mr. Xi has utterly failed to manage the United States-Chinese relationship. In contrast, every Chinese leader since the founding of the communist state in 1949 had recognized the paramount importance of those ties, worked hard to improve them -- and reaped huge benefits.\n\nMao staged Ping-Pong diplomacy to break the ice in 1971, and President Nixon supported him in his standoff against the Soviet Union. Deng Xiaoping went all-out to woo the United States, and President Jimmy Carter switched recognition of China from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. During the 1980s, the C.C.P. leaders Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang invited Milton Friedman and other American economists to visit and provide advice; after that, American capital and technology started flowing into China. In 1997, Jiang Zemin made an eight-day visit to the United States -- at one point, while in Williamsburg, Va., putting on a three-cornered colonial hat. Bill Clinton then gave China a strong push to enter the World Trade Organization in 2001.\n\nThe Hu Jintao years, 2003-13, saw China's most tactful exploitation of American openness (and na\u00efvet\u00e9). Cheap Chinese imports created runaway bilateral trade deficits for the United States. The Confucius Institutes, a network of language schools cum influence agencies, began to take root in American universities and high schools. (Today, there are more than 100 throughout the United States.) Chinese venture capitalists flooded Silicon Valley with money raised in American financial markets -- then quietly siphoned off cutting-edge American expertise and injected it into China's own high-tech hub.\n\nBut Mr. Xi has been aggressively hard-line. Under him, anti-American rhetoric has spread in official media. The Chinese government has been explicit about wanting to challenge the United States's military presence in Asia. It has made aggressive moves toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea. It has sent Chinese battleships through American waters off the coast of Alaska. (It claimed to only be exercising the internationally recognized right of \"innocent passage,\" but the move clearly was a show of force.)\n\nState authorities in Beijing try to co-opt members of China's vast diaspora, hoping to develop a network that will facilitate political infiltration into other countries and high-tech transfers out of them. To this end, they resort to both overt schemes, like the Thousand Talents Plan, an official headhunting program, and covert tactics overseen by the C.C.P.'s influence machine, the United Front.\n\nThese efforts have set off alarms among some Americans. In 2017 and 2018, two groups of blue-ribbon scholars and ex-officials from previous United States administrations advocated a fundamental change in America's view of China. Their members were moderates and mostly well-disposed toward China. Yet some of their recommendations dovetailed with the views of the Trump administration hawks who consider China to be America's number-one enemy and security threat. Mr. Xi, apparently oblivious to this sea change, was caught unprepared when Mr. Trump hit China with a tariff war.\n\nThe dispute is having a knock-on effect elsewhere in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, and Europe. After a summit in Brussels last month, China agreed to grant European Union countries \"improved\" market access, stop the forced transfer of technology and discuss the possibility of curtailing state subsidies to Chinese companies, which, other governments say, gives them an unfair competitive advantage. Although these concessions were presented in the mild, mutual-promise language of a joint statement, they were a clear setback for China and will blunt its global ambitions.\n\nWhy is all of this happening under Mr. Xi? History suggests an answer.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Mao began to challenge the Soviet Union's leadership of the international communist movement, then a potent force that hoped to overturn the United States-led world order. Mao was also seeking global dominance, in line with the traditional concept that the emperor of the Middle Kingdom was the rightful ruler of \"tian xia\" (\u5929\u4e0b), everything under the heavens. But Mao overreached; China wasn't strong enough for that then. The Soviet Union's decision to scrap aid programs to China and pull out its scientific and technological advisers there dealt a severe blow to China's underperforming socialist economy.\n\nLike Mao with the Soviets, Mr. Xi may have challenged the global leadership of the United States too hard and too soon.\n\nRelatedMore from Opinion on China:Opinion | Yi-Zheng LianWhere Spying Is the LawMarch 13, 2019Opinion | Wang Feng and Yong CaiChina Isn't Having Enough BabiesFeb. 26, 2019Opinion | Yi-Zheng LianChina Has a Vast Influence Machine, and You Don't Even Know ItMay 21, 2018Opinion | Yukon HuangChina's Economy Is Not Normal. It Doesn't Have to Be.March 13, 2018\n\nMr. Xi's second major shortcoming has been his failure to articulate a coherent set of policies to stop the Chinese economy's long-term weakening, after many years of stellar performance. China's gross-domestic-product growth in 2018 was the weakest in 28 years. The figure for the first quarter of this year was 6.4 percent, compared with the record high of 15.4 percent for the same period in 1993. Even that number would be the envy of many Western states, but the decline should concern China's leadership because it underlines the country's structural problems -- notably, a rapidly graying population, a shrinking labor force and a total debt-to-G.D.P. ratio that neared 300 percent in the first quarter of 2018. The Japanese bank Nomura has estimated that defaults on bonds denominated in renminbi (also known as yuan) quadrupled between 2017 and 2018.\n\nWeighed down by demographics and debt, China can hardly expand through more private investment and consumption. Worse, since its economy already has some huge excess capacities (think newly built ghost towns), government stimulus isn't very effective. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2008, it took one trillion yuan of credit to generate one trillion yuan of economic output; by 2017, the ratio was 3.5-to-1.\n\nYet Xi has done little to address these structural issues.\n\nEvidence of severe demographic problems had become apparent by the late 2000s, but in 2016 Mr. Xi merely replaced the one-child policy with a two-child policy. Too little, too late. China's number of newborns per year has dropped since the changes. The 2018 total was the lowest since 1961, a year struck by a terrible famine. Mr. Xi signed off on an economic stimulus package in 2015 that was 25 percent larger than his predecessor's emergency plan in 2009, which had been implemented as a response to the global financial crisis. And again, in January and February of this year alone, even while Mr. Xi has been paying lip service to the need to wean the economy off state support, the government offered new loans and financing exceeding the package for all of 2015, according to an article in Forbes.\n\nA third criticism of Mr. Xi is that under him, China has sponsored or condoned actions by Chinese citizens and entities worldwide that have damaged the country's international reputation while degrading its own moral fabric.\n\nTake intellectual property, for example. The United States seems to have hard evidence that it was the policy of Huawei, a flagship Chinese high-tech company, to reward employees for I.P. theft. And, as I have written before, such a policy is encouraged, arguably even mandatory, under China's 2017 National Intelligence Law.\n\nTraditionally, the ideal Chinese state is a Confucian state that adheres to strict moral and behavioral norms. Yet for all his cracking down on corruption at home, Mr. Xi has encouraged moral turpitude abroad; his vision of China is a nation of patriotic thieves. All Chinese arguably have lost face as a result, and now innocent people overseas may be dismissed out of hand as guilty by association.\n\nMr. Xi is widely seen as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao. After the Constitution was amended last year, he could be president for life -- unless his serious failures of leadership give his opponents at home enough reason to cut him short.\n\nYi-Zheng Lian, a commentator on Hong Kong and Asian affairs, is a professor of economics at Yamanashi Gakuin University, in Kofu, Japan, and a contributing opinion writer.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Lynch and David J. Lynch Financial writer covering trade and globalization Robert Costa Robert Costa National political reporter covering the White House, Congress and campaigns May 6 at 5:34 PM\n\nSenior U.S. officials accused Beijing on Monday of reneging on commitments it had agreed to during negotiations for a comprehensive trade deal and vowed that punishing tariffs on Chinese imports would more than double Friday.\n\nDespite the tough talk, Robert E. Lighthizer, the president's chief trade negotiator, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration expects to host Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and a Chinese team for further talks in Washington on Thursday evening and Friday.\n\nBut with the officials publicly underscoring President Trump's weekend anti-China broadside, prospects for a deal this week -- as the administration had hoped for -- appear to be fading.\n\n\"Over the course of the last week or so, we have seen an erosion in commitments by China. I would say retreating from specific commitments that had already been made,\" Lighthizer told reporters in Washington. \"That, in our view, is unacceptable.\"\n\nThe Chinese sought to make \"substantial\" changes in the agreed text of a voluminous, seven-chapter pact, he said, adding, \"Really, I would use the word 'reneging' on prior commitments.\"\n\nThe administration officials declined to specify where the Chinese sought to amend the proposed accord.\n\nChinese demands to water down provisions in the deal were delivered to the administration late last week, infuriating the president, who responded by announcing new tariff plans Sunday. That move triggered the sharpest fall in Chinese stock markets in more than three years.\n\nIn the United States, the market reaction was muted. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 471 points at the open, but quickly recovered and closed at 26,438.48, down less than 67 points or 0.25 percent.\n\nThe apparent diplomatic impasse comes with both countries having reason to believe they could endure a prolonged conflict -- and with Chinese President Xi Jinping probably reassessing the political gains and losses associated with bowing to U.S. demands.\n\nThe U.S. economy grew in the first quarter at a surprisingly robust 3.2 percent rate, and unemployment fell last month to its lowest point in nearly 50 years. Meanwhile in China, government stimulus measures have insulated the economy from the worst effects of the trade war.\n\n\"Recent developments on both sides may have ended up strengthening both sides' spines and reducing the urgency of a deal,\" said David Loevinger, managing director of TCW, a Los Angeles-based investment firm.\n\nLighthizer and Mnuchin, who briefed reporters at the trade representative's office, brushed aside worries about the impact on the economy or financial markets if the talks collapse. Mnuchin said stock market concerns are playing no role in the administration's strategy.\n\nLiu, the Chinese negotiator and a Xi ally, may have encountered political resistance when he presented the nearly complete deal to the Politburo Standing Committee of China's Communist Party, said Dennis Wilder, a former China analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nU.S. demands for structural changes in China's state-led economic model would hurt many state-owned enterprises and their political patrons.\n\n\"There may have been a little sticker shock,\" Wilder said. \"We're dealing with a 150-page document that's very comprehensive and touches all kinds of Chinese vested interests at the national and provincial levels.\"\n\nTrump's ambitions for a fundamental reset of the U.S.-China economic relationship are colliding with internal politics in the opaque Chinese system. The American president wants a dramatic reduction in the $375 billion U.S. trade deficit with China along with an end to discrimination against foreign firms in China.\n\nThough perhaps the most powerful Chinese ruler since Deng Xiaoping, Xi has been criticized for mismanaging the relationship with the United States and failing to understand its populist president.\n\n\"This is a monumental trade deal. It's the biggest thing since they joined the [World Trade Organization] that we've tried to do with China,\" Wilder said. \"The stakes are very high, and they're political stakes.\"\n\nThe administration still is holding out hope for a deal. Mnuchin said that if the two sides make significant progress Thursday, \"we would report back to the president.\"\n\nTrump has delayed the tariff increase -- to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion in Chinese goods -- at least twice and could do so again.\n\nBut Lighthizer said he plans to publish the required Federal Register notice as soon as Thursday, formally setting in motion the increase, which would take effect Friday. In response to a question about the effect of a sudden tariff jump on American companies that have goods en route from China, Lighthizer said companies had received adequate warning of the import levies over months of trade talks.\n\nObtaining Chinese agreement to stop compelling U.S. companies to surrender their trade secrets to do business in China and to stop stealing American intellectual property would be worth suffering some short-term pain, he suggested.\n\n\"The practices that we are objecting to by China are having very negative effects on the U.S. economy,\" he said. \"These are not benign actions we are objecting to.\"\n\nIn 10 rounds of bargaining over the past year, the two sides made \"substantial progress, more progress than has ever been made before in any discussion with China,\" Mnuchin said.\n\nAs an example, the two officials said the Chinese had agreed to eliminate \"market-distorting subsidies,\" a key U.S. objective.\n\nAdded Lighthizer: \"We are still in the process of talking. We're not breaking off talks at this point.\"\n\nThe administration staged a show of unity Monday, with Larry Kudlow, head of the National Economic Council, and Peter Navarro, a leading White House China hawk, appearing in the room as Lighthizer and Mnuchin spoke.\n\nLighthizer and Navarro are generally regarded as seeking deep changes in Chinese trade and economic policies, while Kudlow and Mnuchin are seen as more worried about the health of U.S. financial markets.\n\nSome industry groups already oppose an escalation of Trump's tariff war. Cal Dooley, American Chemistry Council president, said the U.S. tariffs and China's retaliatory levies are increasing the U.S. trade deficit.\n\nAmerican companies have been stockpiling chemicals from Chinese suppliers that are available from no other countries, while exports to China have been depressed by Chinese retaliation.\n\n\"The tariffs are disrupting supply chains, cutting off markets and eroding U.S. chemical manufacturing competitiveness,\" said Dooley.\n\nDavid French, senior vice president of government relations for the National Retail Federation, said that consumers would feel the sting of additional tariffs and that small businesses would struggle to absorb the blow.\n\n\"Anybody trying to run a business knows that what you want is predictability and consistency,\" he said. \"That certainly has not been the case on the trade front for a while.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-ecN20NljjSpMAsfoDjqzE_gXDM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RCKGGTDQIYI6THYGL7BO5AACPI.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4766536", "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 294893460}, {"uri": "1129553437", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-06", "time": "19:39:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-06T19:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/us/politics/trump-tariffs-china.html", "title": "Trump's Tariff Threat Stemmed From Concerns U.S. Is Losing in Trade Deal", "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump's threat to impose more tariffs on China before this week's final round of trade talks stemmed from his concerns that the United States was about to be on the losing end of a historic trade deal.\n\nMr. Trump, whose Sunday threat could derail efforts to end a monthslong trade war, was angered by China's attempt to reverse commitments to essentially codify an agreement to provide American companies with more equal treatment, according to people familiar with the negotiations. The president was also irked by China's insistence that the United States quickly lift all of the tariffs Mr. Trump had placed on $250 billion worth of imports.\n\nA final trade agreement could still be reached, and China, which depends on the United States economy for trade, said on Monday that it still planned to send a delegation to the United States this week for talks. However, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry declined to specify on Monday whether Vice Premier Liu He, who has led the talks for the Chinese, would still travel to the United States for scheduled meetings, instead saying that \"the Chinese team is preparing to go to the U.S. for consultations.\"\n\nMr. Trump's last-minute warning highlights the difficult political position facing his administration as it tries to convince businesses, lawmakers and consumers that the deal it strikes with China will truly level the playing field and put the United States in a better economic position. He is also facing pressure to show that the pain of his trade war will be worth it for the companies, farmers and consumers caught in the middle.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump repeated his insistence that China rebalance its economic relationship with the United States and end its role as a net exporter of goods.\n\nThe president's promise to raise tariffs to 25 percent on Friday and eventually tax another $325 billion worth of Chinese goods sent global markets down on Monday, as investors worried that the trade war could be prolonged indefinitely. Stocks fell sharply after trading opened, with the S&P 500 starting down more than 1 percent. But the market gained ground throughout the trading day. Shortly before 3 p.m., the S&P 500 was down a bit less than 0.5 percent.\n\nThe decision to up the ante came after Mr. Trump's trade advisers made a short trip to Beijing last week. Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, returned from that visit dismayed by China's refusal to mention commitments it had made to update various Chinese laws in the final text of the trade agreement.\n\nInstead, Chinese negotiators had insisted that any concessions would need to be achieved through regulatory and administrative actions, not through changes made to Chinese law through its legislature. The provisions included, but were not limited to, the forced transfer of technology from American companies to Chinese firms, the people familiar with the negotiations said.\n\nChinese negotiators have also continued to insist that Mr. Trump lift the tariffs he has placed on $250 billion worth of goods more quickly than the administration wants. With the two sides still disagreeing over issues including how China subsidizes its companies, its restrictions on data transfers, rules for foreign cloud computing companies and its approvals of genetically modified seeds, the president concluded that China's offers were not good enough.\n\nLate last week, Mr. Trump and a small circle of advisers decided the United States was in a strong enough economic position to ramp up tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese exports. People familiar with the president's thinking said that he believed that a strong American economy would enable the United States to withstand any blowback from those higher tariffs -- including Chinese retaliation -- until China was ready to come back to the negotiating table.\n\nHis unconventional approach drew accolades from both sides of the political aisle.\n\n\"Hang tough on China, President @realDonaldTrump,\" Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said on Twitter.\n\n\"Excellent decision by @realDonaldTrump!\" Laura Ingraham, a Fox News host, tweeted, which the president retweeted onto his feed. \"No other president has had the guts to take on the China challenge.\"\n\nAdvisers to Mr. Trump say he has felt vindicated by a string of positive economic data, in particular the first-quarter gross domestic product, which increased partly as a result of rising exports. While economists have attributed economic growth in the first quarter to a variety of factors, the president and his advisers interpreted the figures as evidence that his tariffs are reducing the trade deficit and boosting growth.\n\nMr. Trump's belief that his trade war is not having an economic downside is fueling his insistence that some of the tariffs on China remain in place. But China has insisted that all of the tariffs must come off as part of the deal.\n\nThe president has turned to tariffs as a source of leverage to bring other negotiations to the close. In talks last year over the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Trump threatened to leave Canada out of the deal entirely and strike a deal with Mexico, a gambit that brought negotiations to a rapid conclusion.\n\nYet analysts have questioned whether volatility in the stock markets could change the president's mind. He has repeatedly referred to stock markets as a kind of scoreboard for his presidency.\n\nIn a note on Monday, Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR, an economic research firm, said that his forecast and most others assumed that the United States-China trade talks resulted in no further damage, at a minimum. \"Given expectations of an agreement, failure to achieve one would be a serious blow to markets and the economy,\" he wrote.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/06/business/06DC-CHINATRADE-01/merlin_154302342_d3b1a8d0-63b0-4200-92a3-b00b1a40c4a5-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4766536", "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 294867540}, {"uri": "1129451219", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-06", "time": "16:52:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-06T16:52:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/06/what-voters-think-about-foreign-policy/", "title": "Opinion | How to talk to voters about foreign policy", "body": "President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin answer questions during a joint news conference after their summit on July 16, 2018, in Helsinki. (Chris McGrath/Getty Images) By Jennifer Rubin Jennifer Rubin Opinion writer covering politics and policy, foreign and domestic Opinion writer May 6 at 12:30 PM\n\nFor a decade or so, staunch supporters of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars have dismissed voters' reticence about military action, as if voters are an inconvenient obstacle who should be ignored by high-minded leaders for the sake of the national interest. By contrast, severe critics of both wars and of American engagement in the world generally have pointed to voter fatigue about military action, have transformed that into opposition to all international engagement and suggested it's impossible to persuade voters of the need for strategic engagement. Both misunderstand public opinion and the relationship between leaders and voters.\n\nA fascinating study put out by the Center for American Progress, consisting of both qualitative data (focus groups) and quantitative data (polling), gives considerable insight into attitudes about foreign policy and what is and isn't getting through to voters. CAP's study gives support for the conclusion that neither military interventionism nor isolationism captures the state of public opinion. The study also points to the utter ineffectiveness of much of the foreign policy debate and to the need for more voter engagement on issues that ultimately affect their safety and security.\n\nFirst and foremost, CAP's study shows \"high levels of uncertainty among voters about U.S. foreign policy goals.\" Less-educated voters seem especially uncertain about our goals. (\"Nearly 6 in 10 college educated voters, those with a 4-year degree or higher, feel they generally have a good understanding of foreign policy goals, while 39 percent of these voters say they are generally confused. In comparison, only 47 percent of noncollege educated voters, those without a 4-year degree, say they have a good handle on what the United States is seeking to do with its foreign policy, with a nearly equal proportion, 46 percent, saying they are confused.\")\n\nA good deal of the problem stems from how politicians talk about foreign policy:\n\nTraditional language from foreign policy experts about \"fighting authoritarianism and dictatorship,\" \"promoting democracy,\" or \"working with allies and the international community\" uniformly fell flat with voters in our groups. Some participants questioned the idea that an international community actually exists. Democracy promotion reminded others of the 2003 Iraq War and the failures of the George W. Bush administration. When asked what the phrase \"maintaining the liberal international order\" indicated to them, all but one of the participants in our focus groups drew a blank. Voters across educational lines simply did not understand what any of these phrases and ideas meant or implied.\n\nIf leaders want to solicit support for foreign policy, they have to explain in concrete terms what we are doing and why it's going to benefit us.\n\nSecond, voters aren't anti-engagement, but they are wary and skeptical of engagement. Fifty-one percent believe \" 'America is stronger when we take a leading role in the world to protect our national interests and advance common goals with other allies,' versus 44 percent who believe the opposite, that 'America is stronger when we focus on our own problems instead of inserting ourselves in other countries' problems,' with another 5 percent of voters not sure either way.\" The authors call this \"restrained engagement.\" When politicians talk about engagement or leadership, they need to explain the scope of our commitments and make clear whether they are advocating military/hard power engagement or diplomatic and economic/soft power engagement.\n\nThird, there is large agreement in making certain that our domestic needs are met before or even while we pursue foreign policy goals. Sixty-eight percent agree: \"In order to remain competitive in the world, the United States must invest more to improve our own infrastructure, education, and health care, not just increase military and defense spending.\" The idea of cutting domestic spending to pay for the military is strongly rejected. If politicians, especially Democrats, want to maintain support for international leadership, they better make clear that this will not detract from their domestic priorities.\n\nFourth, there are two foreign policy objectives that garner supermajority support: \"protecting the U.S. homeland and its people from external threats -- particularly terrorist attacks -- and protecting jobs for American workers.\" It's true that voters also want to protect our democracy, work with allies and promote human rights, but these are secondary concerns. (Republicans continue to prioritize as exceptionally important protecting the country from illegal immigration; Democrats are more enthusiastic about fighting global threats such as climate change and disease.)\n\nIf politicians want public support, they better start explaining why bolstering democracies, maintaining bases around the world and sustaining foreign aid (to name three mainstays of bipartisan policy) will ensure our safety and security. The answer might be as simple as: \"We will protect against cyberattacks that can wreck our economy and steal our technology\" or \"We need to give aid certain countries to protect against transnational epidemics, mass migration and drug trafficking.\" It's going to be hard to justify pursuit of abstract goals (\"maintaining the international order\") unless we tie specific actions to specific benefits to Americans.\n\nFinally, President Trump is bombing on foreign policy. Only 40 percent agree with his handling of foreign policy. Moreover, \"only 31 percent of voters overall believe, 'The United States is more respected around the world because of President Trump's leadership,' versus 62 percent who believe, 'Under President Trump, America is losing respect around the world and alienating historic allies,' with 7 percent not sure.\" If you're a Democrat running for president, you would look at this data and see some major arguments: Trump isn't making us safer (e.g. North Korea is testing missiles again, and we have no coherent policy on North Korea). Trump's trade wars hurt our economy, while his indulgence of dictators makes us less safe. He is either too in need of emotional approval or too financially conflicted to look out for Americans' interests.\n\nIn contrast to Trump, Democrats should tell voters that we are safer and more prosperous when we lead in the world and work with allies on mutual problems. We cannot address threats such as terrorism, cyberterrorism, nuclear proliferation or climate change by ourselves. That's not a very detailed or definitive foreign policy agenda, but the projection of a calm, rational and restrained commander in chief is likely to receive favorable reviews. If nothing else, it would be a change of pace for a Trump-weary public.\n\nJennifer Rubin: Democrats better be able to tackle Trump's catastrophic foreign policy\n\nE.J.

May 6 at 8:09 AM\n\nBEIJING -- President Trump is, according to the Chinese Internet, Thanos, the Marvel supervillain who can wipe out half of the universe with a snap of his fingers. But in Trump's case, it's the Chinese stock market he destroyed with his threats to raise tariffs if Beijing doesn't bend to his demands on trade.\n\nThe apocalypse-themed \"Avengers: Endgame\" movie is breaking box office records in both China and the United States and is clearly influencing reactions to the latest phase of the long-running U.S.-China trade war.\n\n\"Move my fingers, wipe out half of Chinese investors,\" said one popular meme circulating on Chinese social media Monday, showing Trump with one real hand and one jewel-encrusted metal hand like the movie villain. \"Trump led to global panic with his Thanos-like presence,\" said a post on Weibo, showing Trump in full bad-guy suit.\n\nThe Chinese stock markets had their sharpest fall in more than three years Monday, with the Shanghai Composite Index losing 5.58 percent and the Shenzhen Component Index closing down 7.56 percent. The tightly-controlled Chinese currency dropped to a four-month low after Trump's surprise tweets.\n\n\"Go have a look at the Chinese stock market, I smashed it,\" read another popular comment on Chinese social media, this one showing Trump in normal attire and with a smug look on his face.\n\nInvestors were taken by surprise after both sides had signaled that they were close to reaching a deal to end their protracted trade war.\n\nAmerican trade negotiators were in Beijing last week for talks that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described as \"productive,\" and a Chinese delegation is due in Washington on Wednesday.\n\n[Trump's washing-machine tariffs cost U.S. consumers $815,000 for every job created]\n\nThen Trump, who prides himself on being a master dealmaker, took to Twitter on Sunday threatening to increase tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent on Friday, and levy a new 25 percent fee on the remaining $325 billion of Chinese \"untaxed\" imports \"shortly.''\n\nTrump doubled down on his threat early Monday morning Washington time. \"The United States has been losing, for many years, 600 to 800 Billion Dollars a year on Trade,\" he tweeted. \"With China we lose 500 Billion Dollars. Sorry, we're not going to be doing that anymore!\"\n\nThe president's sudden combative tone -- which came after his predictions last month of a \"monumental\" and \"epic\" deal -- sparked speculation that President Xi Jinping might call off this week's talks.\n\nBut a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Monday that the Chinese delegation was set to travel as scheduled. \"The Chinese team is preparing to travel to the U.S. for the trade talks,\" Geng Shuang told reporters, saying that Trump had made many similar threats before.\n\n\"China's position is always clear-cut and U.S. knows that,\" he said, describing recent rounds as making \"positive progress.\"\n\n\"We hope the U.S. and China will work together to reach a mutually beneficial treaty on the basis of mutual respect. This is not only in the interest of China but also the interest of the U.S., as well as the aspiration of international community,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Geng did not specifically answer whether Liu He, the vice premier who has led the Chinese negotiating team, would travel to Washington or whether lower-level officials would go.\n\nTrump says he will increase tariffs on Chinese goods on Friday as he complains about pace of trade talks\n\nThe worst justification for Trump's battle with China?

Liu He, the Chinese vice premier overseeing economic policy and Beijing's lead trade negotiator, had been set to travel to Washington for talks scheduled for Wednesday that were widely seen as the potential last round before reaching a trade deal.\n\nMr. Liu's plans were unclear as of Monday. At a daily news conference on Monday, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, said a team of Chinese trade negotiators was still planning a trip to Washington. Still, Mr. Geng declined to say when the visit might take place or whether Mr. Liu would be on it.\n\nEarlier on Monday in China, people familiar with the talks said officials are considering whether Mr. Liu should keep his plans to visit Washington. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe uncertainty sent global markets reeling on Monday. Chinese shares fell more than 6 percent before recovering a modest amount of ground, while Hong Kong's stock market fell 3 percent. Major markets in Europe began the day more than 1 percent lower, and futures that track shares in the United States suggested Wall Street would open considerably lower as well.\n\nThe threats pose a major problem for Xi Jinping, China's top leader, who had been counting on a trade deal to keep China's growth engine humming. Broad differences still separate the two sides on many issues, and Mr. Trump's tweeted threat on Sunday indicated that the United States may be less willing to accept compromises than some of his senior aides had previously seemed to suggest.\n\nChina's economic growth began to slow last year as Beijing tried to tame the country's overreliance on lending. Mr. Trump's initial tariffs last year hurt Chinese manufacturers and consumer confidence, worsening the slowdown. China's economic slowdown limited Mr. Xi's options to retaliate against American tariffs and put pressure on him to reach a deal.\n\nIn recent months, thanks in part to new lending, China's slowdown appeared to stabilize. The prospect of a trade deal also boosted consumer and investor confidence and led many economists to estimate China's growth would improve.\n\nNew tariffs could derail that progress. Through Twitter, Mr. Trump warned on Sunday that he would increase tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods at the end of this week and \"shortly\" impose levies on $325 billion of additional imports.\n\n\"If tariffs are hiked this Friday and new tariffs come soon after that the biggest negative impact will likely occur in the next few months,\" Tao Wang, an economist specializing in China at UBS, said in a research note.\n\nShe estimated that a full-blown trade war with the United States could cut China's economic growth rate by 1.6 to 2 percentage points over the next 12 months. That would be a considerable cut: Last year China's economy grew 6.6 percent, according to official figures, and the government has sent an official target of 6 percent to 6.5 percent this year.\n\nIllustrating the sensitivity of the problem for China's leaders, Chinese media was mostly silent on Mr. Trump's threat, in a sign of tight censorship. Still, pictures of graphs showing China's stock market plunge and veiled references to Mr. Trump were rife on Chinese social media. One popular meme compared Mr. Trump to Thanos, the villain in the blockbuster \"Avengers: Engame\" film, saying the American president could kill half of China's investors with a snap of his fingers.\n\nMr. Xi will face internal difficulties in coping with Mr. Trump's aggressive threat. He risks weakening his position if he is seen as giving in to American demands, especially in areas where many people in China feel the country has to make progress, such as in technology, if it wants to keep growing at a healthy pace.\n\nIn fact, Chinese internal politics may be at the root of the sudden hitch in the trade talks.\n\nThe Trump administration has reacted much more strongly than the Chinese government expected to an issue that came up in negotiations last week in Beijing between senior Chinese and American officials, the people familiar with the trade talks said. That was when Chinese negotiators said that any concessions in the trade agreement would need to be done through regulatory and administrative actions by the Chinese government, and not cemented in place through actual changes in Chinese law through the country's legislature.\n\nForeign critics have long derided China legislature, the National People's Congress, as a rubber stamp for the Communist Party. Bills backed by top leaders are approved by overwhelming majorities, often with only a handful of votes against them. But top leaders also do a lot of back-room maneuvering before any bill is introduced. Sometimes the maneuvering goes on for years without a consensus being reached. The congress also meets only once a year, making it difficult to get legislation approved quickly.\n\nThe National People's Congress has a body of top leaders, called the standing committee, that has fairly broad powers and meets roughly every two months through the rest of the year. Still, major bills are supposed to be approved by the entire legislature.\n\nJames Zimmerman, a partner in the Beijing office of the Perkins Coie law firm, said that China's State Council, its cabinet, could make the necessary changes on its own. However, handling legal changes quietly through the State Council would make them less visible to provincial and local officials in China. The United States has tried to force through changes in how all levels of government in China handle questions like forced technology transfers and export subsidies, not just the national government in Beijing.\n\nAlready, the National People's Congress in March enacted a new foreign investment law that changed many rules for overseas companies doing business in the country. Doing legislative changes then, before the trade talks had ended, was widely seen as a face-saving move by China. But foreign business groups criticized the new law from the start as inadequate.\n\nOutside the trade talks, Beijing has taken other steps to bolster the economy.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang in March pushed through the legislature a tax cut for manufacturers that is likely to particularly help sectors that may be involved in exporting to the United States. Some Chinese companies have already been offering discounts to American corporate buyers to offset part or all of the cost of President Trump's tariffs. China's central bank announced on Monday morning that it was adjusting bank rules to make it easier for small and medium-sized banks to lend more money to the country's private sector.\n\nThere is little else that Beijing can do in the meantime to mollify its people and businesses or the broader markets.\n\n\"It's a huge uncertainty,\" Hao Hong, the chief strategist at the Bank of Communications' international operations, said, \"and there's no model that allows you to estimate your risk.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keith_bradsher@nytimes.com", "name": "Keith Bradsher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "eventUri": "eng-4766536", "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 294830700}, {"uri": "1128980212", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-06", "time": "05:11:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-06T05:11:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.47843137383461, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/06/glaring-absence-trumps-showdown-with-china/", "title": "Analysis | The glaring absence in Trump's showdown with China", "body": "By Ishaan Tharoor Ishaan Tharoor Reporter covering foreign affairs, geopolitics and history May 6 at 12:59 AM\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know? Sign up for the Today's WorldView newsletter.\n\n(Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump provocatively stoked the embers of the U.S. trade war with China with a pair of tweets on Sunday. He signaled his intent to increase tariffs on Chinese imports by the end of the week, just days after telling reporters the two countries were potentially close to a \"historic\" trade deal. The Trump administration is preparing for the Wednesday arrival of Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and a delegation of more than 100 officials to restart high-level negotiations. U.S. officials have said they hoped to wrap up a sweeping deal soon, but \"Trump's abrupt intervention adds a volatile element to the talks,\" wrote my colleagues.\n\nAs our colleagues noted, Trump repeated the falsehood that China pays for the tariffs -- rather than the American importers upon whom the levy falls. His insistence that the tariffs were a boon to the American economy is also a contention borne out by scant evidence.\n\nTrump has long voiced his personal disquiet over America's bilateral trade deficit with China, while U.S. officials seek protections against China's alleged theft of intellectual property from private U.S. companies as well as a reckoning over Beijing's heavy state involvement in its economy. In recent months, though, there was the sense that a real breakthrough was possible. In February, White House officials said the administration had at least temporarily dropped its plans to raise the tariff rate to 25 percent as hopes grew of the two sides nearing a deal.\n\nBut Trump's tweeted broadsides indicate that he's not optimistic about the next round of talks. Although China has agreed in theory to increase imports of a range of U.S. products, few expect Beijing to make deeper concessions. \"Trump is probably anticipating criticism that we are heading toward a political deal reached for political reasons rather than a trade deal addressing the fundamental economic tools that enable China to discriminate against foreign firms,\" Jeff Moon, who negotiated trade issues with China under President Barack Obama, told my colleagues.\n\nThe irony is that, in its rush for a deal, the Trump administration has conspicuously let some hot-button issues fall to the wayside. Last year, it justified tariffs on more than $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, in part, because of the Chinese government's purported role in supporting cyberattacks on U.S. companies. But reports ahead of Liu's visit suggest the White House was willing to drop the matter for now or water down its original complaint.\n\n\"A lot of issues are being jettisoned from this negotiation because President Trump wants a deal,\" a source briefed on the deliberations told the Financial Times last week.\n\nCritics of the Trump administration point to an omission that is perhaps even more glaring: Human rights, specifically, the rights of millions of ethnic minorities in the far western region of Xinjiang caught in the Orwellian vice of the Chinese security state.\n\nAs readers of Today's WorldView know, in a bid to supposedly counter terrorism, Beijing has set up a vast system of \"reeducation camps\" to dissuade the region's predominantly Muslim Turkic minorities, including Uighurs, from embracing religious extremism. Advocates and Uighur exiles abroad point to a totalitarian dragnet that has disappeared a chunk of the region's population and ushered in a draconian 21st-century surveillance state that even uses artificial-intelligence technology to immediately spot non-Han Chinese faces in a crowd.\n\nThe Trump administration has, at moments, been vocal on behalf of the plight of Uighurs, but it has conspicuously relented on imposing sanctions on key Chinese officials involved in carrying out human rights abuses in Xinjiang. As the New York Times reported over the weekend, the planned sanctions went through the customary interagency process but were then put on ice, much to the chagrin of congressional lawmakers.\n\n\"The sanctions languished at the Treasury Department .\u2009.\u2009. as some senior administration officials believed that they should shelve them during the trade talks,\" noted the Times. \"The sanctions would have been imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act, which allows the executive branch to use economic and travel penalties to punish foreign officials for human rights violations.\"\n\nThere's little doubt over the gravity of the situation in Xinjiang. On Friday, a senior Pentagon official decried the \"mass imprisonment of Chinese Muslims in concentration camps,\" and said as many as 3 million people have been forced into the region's camps. However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to quibble with that assessment Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" He said there was no conflict between the White House's push for trade talks with Beijing and its position on Xinjiang.\n\n\"This administration can do more than one thing at a time. We're working to stop the intellectual property theft that has destroyed millions of jobs in the United States. We're working to stop the foreign technology transfers that have taken place,\" Pompeo said. \"We've got the largest defense budget in history in place, part of which will go to ensuring we counter Chinese military power. We're working on these human rights violations as well.\"\n\nThat's not good enough for rights advocates. \"While the U.S. is negotiating trade agreements, I think it's important to remember that history is not going to remember the details of the negotiations, but where the United States was on this massive human rights issue,\" Francisco Bencosme, the Asia-Pacific advocacy manager at Amnesty International USA, told Foreign Policy last month.\n\nFor Rushan Abbas, a Uighur exile in the United States whose relatives were detained in Xinjiang in September, it's a matter of their community's very existence. \"I strongly believe that the human rights abuses the Chinese government is doing against the Uighurs should be part of the trade talks,\" Abbas told the Times. \"They are facing indoctrination, brainwashing and elimination of their values as Muslims.\"\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

The deal must have structural reforms.", "body": "By Editorial Board May 5 at 6:40 PM\n\nTHE TRUMP administration and China appear to be in the final stages of negotiations on what could be a major trade agreement between the two countries. High-level talks move back to Washington on Wednesday, with a tentative deal foreseeable soon thereafter, to be followed by a wrap-up visit to the United States by President Xi Jinping. It's not too soon to start defining the minimum conditions of an acceptable deal from the U.S. point of view.\n\n\"Structural\" is the key concept here, as President Trump has acknowledged. We had our doubts about Mr. Trump's imposition of tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of Chinese imports, in part because it provoked China's own tariffs on U.S. goods and in part because the president's invocation of \"national security\" as a legal rationale threatened to undermine the reciprocity-based trading system more broadly. Aggressive as they were, his tactics could be redeemed if they force China to change not only such transitory factors as how many soybeans it buys from the United States, but also more deeply embedded trade-distorting practices such as systematic subsidies for state-owned exporters and forced technology transfers imposed on U.S. and other foreign investors.\n\nOn this point, there is cause for concern in recent indications that the administration has all but abandoned the goal of greater digital openness in China's economy. The New York Times reports that the administration is prepared to accept China's tight regulations that prevent foreign firms from transferring data they gather on Chinese customers for storage outside the country. Instead, it would continue to be stored on servers inside China. This would disadvantage American and other non-Chinese firms in the global competition to create advanced technologies and business methods, including, potentially, those related to artificial intelligence. Perhaps more disturbing, it could help China's communist rulers maintain their tight grip on political and artistic dissent, contrary to basic individual rights but consistent with Chinese leaders' claim that they need control over the data for \"national security\" reasons.\n\nAny trade negotiation requires give and take. So far, Mr. Trump seems to be gaining some ground in areas such as agricultural and energy sales and intellectual property protection; the Chinese seem ready to concede greater latitude for U.S. companies to operate without Chinese joint venture partners. They expect to be rewarded with an end to some or all of the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed.\n\nYet China may not be bargaining from a position of as much strength, economically, as it would have had a few years ago. Growth is slowing, and debt is rising -- creating an opportunity for the Trump administration to achieve goals that have eluded previous administrations. Unfortunately, the president's fixation on short-term trade deficits, and his inclination to retain tariffs rather than cash them in for deeper Chinese concessions, may lead to an outcome that leaves China unchanged, except cosmetically.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr Trump threatened to further raise tariffs Friday if no deal is reached. Undoubtedly, the American people, and the world, will cheer any deal that removes the threat of a trade war, if only because it removes a source of uncertainty hanging over a generally benign economic situation. But that should not be the standard of success.\n\nMichael Froman: Trump needs a comprehensive trade deal with China.

Lynch David J. Lynch Financial writer covering trade and globalization May 5 at 1:31 PM\n\nPresident Trump said Sunday that he will increase tariffs on Chinese imports on Friday, unexpectedly setting what appears to be a new deadline to produce a comprehensive deal or trigger an escalation of the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nJust days before Chinese negotiators are scheduled to arrive in Washington, the president threatened to increase tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent on Friday and levy a new 25 percent fee on all remaining Chinese imports shortly.\n\n[Trump's washing-machine tariffs cost U.S. consumers $815,000 for every job created]\n\nIn a pair of tweets, Trump accused China of trying to \"renegotiate\" the terms of an agreement that negotiators have been racing to finish for five months.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He is scheduled to arrive in Washington on Wednesday for what had been billed as potentially the concluding rounds of bargaining.\n\nU.S. officials have said they hoped to wrap up a sweeping deal soon, but Trump's abrupt intervention adds a volatile new element to the end game.\n\n\"The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!\" the president tweeted shortly after noon on Sunday.\n\nThe office of the U.S. trade representative, Robert E. Lighthizer, had no immediate response to a request for comment.\n\nThe president repeated his mistaken claim that \"China has been paying Tariffs to the USA\" for 10 months. In fact, American importers pay those import levies.\n\nWhile Chinese exporters on some occasions may lower their prices and absorb part of the tariffs, several recent studies have concluded that almost the entire financial burden has fallen on the U.S. economy.\n\n[The worst justification for Trump's battle with China? The 'clash of civilizations']\n\n\"These payments are partially responsible for our great economic results,\" the president added. Mainstream economists dispute this.\n\nNational Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Sunday that by announcing the tariff increase, Trump was \"issuing a warning\" to China.\n\n\"I'm a free-trade guy. The president's tariffs, however, have been extremely useful in negotiating. ... If it doesn't work out, then I think what the president is saying in today's tweet is that we will continue these tariffs,\" Kudlow said during an appearance on Fox News Channel.\n\nHe acknowledged that there are costs to American farmers and consumers when tariffs are imposed, but he maintained that the administration has taken action to help on that front. He also said that \"structural issues and enforcement issues remain\" when it comes to China's trade practices.\n\n\"China has got to end its unfair, nonreciprocal trading system. They're breaking the laws,\" he said.\n\nU.S. and Chinese negotiators have been meeting for months in an effort to reach a deal that would resolve Trump's complaints about Chinese trade practices and the chronic U.S. trade deficit with China.\n\nThe two sides have been closing in on a deal expected to include major new purchases of American goods and a Chinese commitment to abandon efforts to steal or coerce U.S. companies into surrendering their technology trade secrets.\n\nUntil the president's tweets, recent administration statements about prospects for a deal had been optimistic.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week that recent talks in Beijing were \"productive,\" an assessment echoed in an official White House statement.\n\nLast month, Trump said the two sides were on the verge of an \"epic\" and \"monumental\" deal that would address all of his complaints about Chinese trade practices. In recent days, there have been indications that he was preparing to weaken key demands, including a reduction in massive Chinese subsidies for state firms.\n\nFelicia Sonmez and Damien Paletta contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JsJ_UoXWsEkpc6j8m9PFZIFiFfk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZZVTBFTNEQI6TJTNVAWT6PMW2U.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4766536", "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 294774360}, {"uri": "1127368365", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-03", "time": "14:16:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-03T14:16:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/upshot/unemployment-inflation-changing-economic-fundamentals.html", "title": "The Economy That Wasn't Supposed to Happen: Booming Jobs, Low Inflation", "body": "Maybe using data from a few decades in the middle of the 20th century to set policy in the 21st isn't such a good idea.\n\nThe labor market the United States is experiencing right now wasn't supposed to be possible.\n\nNot that long ago, the overwhelming consensus among economists would have been that you couldn't have a 3.6 percent unemployment rate without also seeing the rate of job creation slowing (where are new workers going to come from with so few out of work, after all?) and having an inflation surge (a worker shortage should mean employers bidding up wages, right?).\n\nAnd yet that is what has happened, with the April employment numbers putting an exclamation point on the trend. The jobless rate receded to its lowest level in five decades. Employers also added 263,000 jobs; the job creation estimates of previous months were revised up; and average hourly earnings continued to rise at a steady rate -- up 3.2 percent over the last year.\n\nCompare that reality with the projections the Federal Reserve published just three years ago. In mid-2016, Fed officials thought that the long-run rate of unemployment would be around 4.8 percent, and that this would coincide with 2 percent inflation.\n\nIf that were the jobless rate today, 1.9 million Americans would not be working who are instead gainfully employed. And despite this ultralow unemployment rate, inflation is only 1.6 percent over the last year, below the level the Fed aims for.\n\nBecause this is 2019 and everything immediately devolves into partisan warfare, these good results are immediately seized upon by Trump partisans who view the good news as a result of the president's policies, and by opponents who give credit to the already-improving economy that President Obama handed over in January 2017.\n\nThere is truth in both. The job market had already been improving for years when President Trump took office, and its performance since then has been more continuation of the trend than an abrupt upturn.\n\nAfter more than two years of the Trump administration, warnings that trade wars and erratic management style would throw the economy off course have proved wrong so far, and tax cuts and deregulation are most likely part of the reason for the strong growth rates in 2018 and the beginning of 2019 (though most forecasts envision a slowing in the coming quarters as the impact of tax cuts fades).\n\nIn particular, it now appears that recession fears that emerged at the end of 2018 were misguided -- especially once the Fed backed off its campaign of rate increases at the start of 2019.\n\nBut beyond the assigning of credit or blame, there's a bigger lesson in the job market's remarkably strong performance: about the limits of knowledge when it comes to something as complex as the $20 trillion U.S. economy.\n\nThe last few years have made it clear that the Phillips curve -- the relationship between unemployment and inflation -- has either changed shape or become irrelevant.\n\nThe breakdown of the old guidelines suggests that policymakers need to avoid overreliance on them, and to stay broad-minded to the full range of economic possibilities. Maybe using data from a few decades in the middle of the 20th century to set policy in the 21st isn't actually a good idea.\n\nThe results of the last few years make you wonder whether we've been too pessimistic about just how hot the United States economy can run without inflation or other negative effects.\n\nThere are even early signs that the tight labor market may be contributing to, or at least coinciding with, a surge in worker productivity, which if sustained would fuel higher wages and living standards over time. That further supports the case for the Fed and other policymakers to let the expansion rip rather than trying to hold it back.\n\nIt's tough setting economic policy. To make decisions, you have to create a forecast, and there's a reason these forecasts tend to be based on historical experience.\n\nBut the last 20 years have been a wrenching period for the world economy, with all sorts of forces that have reshaped fundamentals: globalization, demographic shifts, technological changes and much more. It shouldn't be any wonder that some of the old relationships and rules of thumb don't apply any more.\n\nThe continued boom in the American job market suggests that economic policymakers need to be open about when the lessons of history no longer apply.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_irwin@nytimes.com", "name": "Neil Irwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/02/upshot/up-jobs/up-jobs-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 294588960}, {"uri": "1127146143", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-03", "time": "09:08:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-03T09:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/business/economy/jobs-report-april.html", "title": "April Jobs Report: Here's What to Watch For", "body": "Analysts expect the figures to show strong hiring, as fears of a slowdown have faded and many economic indicators have recently turned upward.\n\nThe Labor Department will release its estimate of hiring and unemployment for April at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time. The monthly report provides one of the better snapshots of the state of the American economy.\n\nAnalysts on Wall Street are looking for a gain of 190,000 jobs, according to Bloomberg, nearly identical to the 196,000 gain recorded in March.\n\nThe unemployment rate is expected to remain at 3.8 percent. If it drops to 3.7 percent, the rate would return to the lowest level of the recovery, a benchmark first reached in September 2018.\n\nAverage hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.3 percent, compared with a 0.1 percent increase in March. After years of sluggish gains, wage growth has picked up recently, and the gain forecast for April would lift the annual increase to 3.3 percent, a hair's breadth from the best level of the current expansion.\n\nThe Numbers\n\nHiring data has been erratic this year. The economy produced a blockbuster 312,000 increase in employment in January. But payrolls barely edged up in February, rising by just 33,000 in the wake of the government shutdown. The job market appeared to stabilize in March, and the three-month moving average for job creation stands at 180,000.\n\nIf Wall Street's expectations for April are correct, it would represent a return to normal.\n\nSunnier Skies?\n\nAfter a round of jitters in late 2018 and early this year, investors and consumers seem to be feeling more confident about the economy's trajectory.\n\nLast week, the Commerce Department reported that the economy expanded at a 3.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, well above forecasts. And on Thursday, the government said factory orders jumped 1.9 percent in March, the best monthly showing since August 2018.\n\nStocks have rallied sharply this year as recession fears have dimmed, with the return of the not-too-hot, not-too-cold scenario favored by traders. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve essentially endorsed that view by leaving interest rates unchanged and reiterating that it was comfortable with where rates stood.\n\n\"It appears that risks have moderated somewhat,\" the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said. \"Our outlook, and my outlook, is a positive one, is a healthy one, for the U.S. economy for the rest of this year.\"\n\nDespite that more sanguine outlook, inflation is running below the Fed's 2 percent target, dimming the odds of a rate increase soon. Investors would like to see a rate cut, as would President Trump, but Mr. Powell indicated that is equally unlikely. A strong jobs report would put a rate cut further out of reach.\n\nIt's not just the markets that have shrugged off once-feared headwinds like slowing global growth, the trade war with China, and Britain's departure from the European Union. Businesses have, too.\n\nAt Two Men and a Truck, a national moving company based in Lansing, Mich., business slowed early this year as the government shutdown and rocky stock market led people to put off moves. But that caution didn't last: Business rebounded in March and surged in April, said Randy Shacka, the company's president.\n\n\"Mid-April, just something switched,\" Mr. Shacka said. \"It's been gangbusters.\"\n\nThe company is racing to hire some 5,000 people for what it anticipates will be a record summer moving season. For the first time this year, it is holding recruiting events where it plans to hire qualified applicants on the spot. At the first event, in Lansing in April, the company made 30 job offers, and it aimed to hire 1,000 people in Texas at several events on Wednesday.\n\n\"We're right in the midst of this crazy time of hiring,\" Mr. Shacka said.\n\nA Tight Labor Market\n\nBusinesses are wrestling with what has become a job-seeker's market, according to Amy Glaser, a senior vice president at staffing company Adecco.\n\n\"The candidates are 100 percent in the driver's seat,\" she said. \"If employers don't respond to job applicants in 48 hours, they're gone. Somebody else has called with a better offer. Or if you schedule an interview too far out, they ghost you.\"\n\nAs a result, employers have been dangling some notable perks, she added. Among them are upgraded cafeterias, day care, and subsidies for essentials like gas and parking. Call-center managers are letting more employees work from home.\n\nCandidates who might have otherwise been stuck on the sidelines for lack of experience are getting a second look, said Martha Gimbel, research director at Indeed, the job-search site. Fast-growing search terms include \"anything full time,\" \"office jobs no experience\" and \"hiring immediately no experience.\"\n\nThe labor-force participation rate, which measures the proportion of people 16 and older is employed or looking for a job, bottomed out at 62.4 percent in September 2015 and now stands at 63 percent. A further improvement would suggest that a strong economy is pulling more Americans back into the work force.\n\nThe Chance of a Surprise\n\nFebruary's very modest gain of 33,000 jobs was a reminder that month-to-month employment reports are more akin to looking at the economy through a single Instagram post than through a time-lapse view.\n\nThe manufacturing sector lost 6,000 jobs in March, and analysts will look at whether that weakness persists, especially as tariffs imposed by the Trump administration bite. The housing sector has been sending mixed signals and construction jobs are down for the year. Watch this space for clues on demand for new homes.\n\nA surprise won't necessarily be to the downside. Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, expects the figures to show a gain of 233,000 jobs, substantially higher than the 190,000 consensus. She attributes some of that gain to early hiring by the Census Bureau as it prepares for the 2020 count.\n\nThe government will ultimately hire half a million temporary workers to collect data, and that surge was reflected in the employment data before the 2010 census. Most of the hiring will take place early in the spring of 2020, Ms. Zentner said, but a smaller, earlier wave could be reflected in Friday's report.\n\nBen Casselman contributed reporting.\n\nMore on the economyWhy Wages Are Finally Rising, 10 Years After the RecessionMay 2, 2019Where the Good Jobs AreMay 2, 2019Overcoming Doubts, U.S. Economy Finds a Way ForwardApril 26, 2019U.S. Adds 196,000 Jobs in March, a Return to Solid GrowthApril 5, 2019", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nelson_d_schwartz@nytimes.com", "name": "Nelson D.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), a Democratic presidential candidate, on March 29. (Nati Harnik/AP) By Jennifer Rubin Jennifer Rubin Opinion writer covering politics and policy, foreign and domestic Opinion writer May 1 at 2:30 PM\n\nA new report confirms that President Trump is causing the most pain in areas of the country that were the most supportive of his 2016 campaign.\n\nPersonal income for farmers fell by the most in three years in the first quarter, as losses to U.S. agriculture mount from President Donald Trump's trade wars.\n\nThe Commerce Department on Monday cited the steep decline in farm proprietors' income as a key factor weighing on the nation's overall personal income growth in March, even though agricultural producers represent only about 2 percent of total employed Americans.\n\nThat last statistic is true, but the services that support them, the local governments that depend on their tax revenue and the communities in which farmers live feel real economic pain. On this, they have only Trump to blame. \"One-time subsidy payments from the Trump administration to compensate producers for some of their trade-war losses helped prop up farm income in the previous quarter, but earnings plunged by an annualized $11.8 billion in the January to March period, according to seasonally adjusted data,\" Bloomberg reports. The president and his staff can make all the empty promises they like, but the president's actions continue to inflict pain on these Americans. \"Trump's budget cuts would lower federal subsidies for crop insurance and small growers. The spending plan for 2020 he submitted for Congress would reduce subsidies for crop insurance premiums to 48 percent from 62 percent and limit current subsidies for growers who make less than $500,000 annually.\"\n\nThen there is the impact of extreme weather, a byproduct of climate change, which Trump and his willfully ignorant supporters deny. Climate change didn't begin with Trump, but climate-change denial as an official policy did. Meanwhile, record flooding continues in the Midwest and will only worsen with time.\n\nDemocrats have been looking for the key to unlocking the rural vote. This however should be a layup for them. Other than progressive protectionists who rather like trade wars, Democratic contenders should be at every farm and farm town in Iowa, as well as a lot of other states where agriculture is a critical part of the overall economy (e.g., Texas, Minnesota, Illinois, Kansas, Wisconsin, Indiana, North Carolina and Ohio).\n\nHere, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) -- who presents herself as the candidate from the heartland -- has a leg up. Her home-state newspaper, the Star Tribune, reported on a visit to Iowa by Klobuchar in late March: \"The Democratic candidate for president showed the kind of fluency with small-town concerns that has helped her again and again defy her party's declining fortunes in rural America.\"\n\nKlobuchar will be quick to remind you that, during her Senate reelection campaign, she won a slew of rural conservative counties. \"I have won every single congressional district including Michele Bachmann's three times in a row,\" she often says, referring to the conservative former representative from Minnesota's 6th Congressional District.\n\nKlobuchar can pull off visits to small towns and rural areas because she knows agriculture (she sits on the Agriculture Committee) and the people who work in it. She knows the ins and outs of soybeans and dairy farms. Not every candidate is going to be at ease stomping around a farm, but there are plenty of townhalls, Farm Bureau meetings and 4-H events.\n\nThe argument is easy: Trump talks a good game, but has inflicted financial pain on rural America (all the while supporting plans to raise their health-care costs). Any candidate could put together a common-sense package of proposals -- ending the seemingly forever trade wars, working to lower prescription drug costs, focusing on climate change, helping -- as Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has done -- fund education (remember that recent teacher strikes have hit red states), expanding broadband coverage and making sure rural areas get their fair share of infrastructure projects.\n\nTrump claims that urban elites don't \"respect\" rural America. In fact, it's Trump who treats them like rubes -- taking their votes and then picking their pockets.\n\nArt Cullen: Five 2020 Democrats took the stage in Iowa. None had answers.\n\nGeorge F.

This is an important part of the negotiations. We must, to the greatest extent possible, lower and prevent the chances of going back on promises,\" one Chinese official close to senior leaders told Reuters.\n\nA second Chinese official with knowledge of the situation said it was too early to say work was in the final stages, but that both sides were \"sprinting\".\n\nIn Washington, people familiar with the talks say that the question of whether and when U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods will be removed will probably be among the last issues to be resolved. Trump has said that he may keep some tariffs on Chinese goods for a \"substantial period.\"\n\nErin Ennis, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said the deal needs to address U.S. complaints about Chinese theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfers, but it also must resolve tariffs.\n\n\"Whatever the resolution is it has got to have a plan of action for the ultimate removal of tariffs, because if it's an input for a product made in the United States or something a U.S. company ships to China, the tariffs inflate costs and make their products less competitive,\" she said.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida who has taken a hawkish stance on China trade and security issues, warned that a deal based on Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural products or a deal that cannot be effectively enforced was unacceptable.\n\n\"If you're not addressing the key industries of the 21st century, in five or 10 years, it's going to not just going to be a bad deal, it'll be a catastrophic one,\" he said. \"They will de-facto dominate those industries.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on April 4 that a deal might be worked out in about four weeks. Last week, he said he would soon host Chinese President Xi Jinping at the White House. A meeting between the two leaders is seen as needed to cement an agreement.\n\nMnuchin, speaking to Fox Business Network in an interview that aired on Monday, said the trade negotiations aimed at enforcement were close to finished.\n\nThe Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi on Tuesday told a separate group of former U.S. lawmakers that the two countries' interests were deeply connected.\n\n\"In recent months, both countries' economic and trade teams have held many rounds of high-level consultations and achieved much positive progress,\" China's Foreign Ministry paraphrased Wang as saying.\n\nChina hopes that both sides can \"work hard, exclude disturbances, and reach a mutually beneficial, win-win agreement,\" he added.\n\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Additional reporting by Michael Martina and Xu Jing in Beijing and Humeyra Pamuk, David Lawder and Alexandra Alper in Washington; writing by Se Young Lee and Ryan Woo; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore, Nick Macfie and Lisa Shumaker)", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@nytimes.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "eventUri": "eng-4756436", "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 294358140}, {"uri": "1123637797", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-29", "time": "02:42:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-29T02:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/us/politics/mnuchin-china-us-trade-negotiations.html", "title": "Mnuchin Says Trade Negotiations With China Are in 'the Final Laps'", "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday that trade talks between the United States and China were entering a critical point as an American delegation heads to Beijing this week to try to finalize a long-awaited deal.\n\nThe United States and China have spent more than a year trying to resolve a trade dispute and reach an agreement that would overhaul the economic relationship between the world's largest economies.\n\nMr. Mnuchin, one of President Trump's lead negotiators, said that while the two sides are closer to an agreement, more work remains to be done, and that the talks are nearing a point where they would either produce a deal or end with no agreement.\n\n\"We're getting into the final laps,\" Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on the sideline of the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Treasury secretary is heading to China on Monday with Robert E. Lighthizer, the Trump administration's top trade negotiator, to try to resolve the remaining sticking points between the countries. Chinese officials are expected to come to Washington on May 8 to continue -- and possibly conclude -- the negotiations.\n\nThe United States and China have been locked in a trade war for months, exchanging tit-for-tat tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of products and rattling global markets.\n\nMr. Trump imposed punishing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods in an effort to force Beijing to make significant changes to its economic practices, including China's requirement that American companies turn over valuable intellectual property as a condition of doing business there.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that talks with China are going well, he has continued to insist that the United States could walk away if it does not get the trade terms it wants. Still, the president stirred optimism last week that the negotiations could be nearing an end when he said President Xi Jinping of China could soon be visiting the White House. Mr. Trump has previously said he expects to hold a signing ceremony with Mr. Xi in the United States.\n\nMr. Mnuchin declined to predict whether the negotiations would be wrapped up by the end of June but said he believes that both countries want to reach a deal. He also would not say if a breakdown in the talks would lead Mr. Trump to impose more tariffs.\n\n\"I think both sides have a desire to reach an agreement,\" Mr. Mnuchin said. \"We've made a lot of progress.\"\n\nAmong the biggest sticking points has been how the two sides would enforce any trade agreement and whether the United States would agree to remove all, or at least most, of the tariffs it placed on Chinese products.\n\nThis month, Mr. Mnuchin said substantial progress had been made on an enforcement mechanism, which would give both sides the ability to hold each other accountable if the agreement was abrogated.\n\nMr. Mnuchin declined to provide details of the remaining obstacles, but he said this round of talks would continue to focus on China's longstanding practice of subsidizing its industries. He also expected the two sides to discuss Mr. Trump's move this month to end waivers that allowed countries like China to import oil from Iran.\n\nAs part of its effort to punish Iran by tightening economic sanctions, the United States gave countries, including China, until May 1 to halt purchases of Iranian oil or face American sanctions.\n\nChina, which imports large quantities of oil from Iran, has criticized the move.\n\n\"China consistently opposes U.S. unilateral sanctions,\" Geng Shuang, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said this month.\n\nMr. Mnuchin said the Trump administration has made clear to China how important the effort is and has conveyed that China would face sanctions if it continued to purchase Iranian oil.\n\n\"There's still some significant issues that are open,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alan_rappeport@nytimes.com", "name": "Alan Rappeport", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/28/us/28dc-mnuchin1/28dc-mnuchin1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4756436", "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 294201720}, {"uri": "1123052938", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-28", "time": "03:22:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-28T03:22:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5215686559677124, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/27/us/politics/trump-rally-green-bay.html", "title": "Even Away From Correspondents' Dinner, Trump Makes Sure to Have His Say", "body": "GREEN BAY, Wis. -- The White House Correspondents' Dinner meant so little to the Trump administration and its boosters that thinly veiled rebukes of the First Amendment-focused event were a running theme of the president's Saturday night campaign rally in Wisconsin.\n\nIt meant little to Brad Parscale, the Trump campaign manager, who took the stage and mentioned that he had been invited: \"Nothing better than just self-serving love,\" he said of the dinner.\n\nIt meant little to the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, whose comedic roasting at last year's dinner led to a reformatted event this spring. As she strode onstage to wild applause and alluded to the dinner, which was unfolding (without a comedian) in Washington, the crowd began a tailor-made chant: \"Sarah! Sarah! Sarah!\"\n\n\"Last year this night I was at a slightly different event,\" Ms. Sanders said. \"Not quite the best welcome. So this is an amazing honor.\"\n\nAnd it meant little to President Trump, who did not mention the dinner by name. Instead, he emphasized the news coverage of his rally, frequently disparaged the news media and told attendees they were having more fun with him than they would with a Democratic president. \"By the way, Saturday night,\" Mr. Trump said in a tongue-in-cheek delivery, \"is there any place that's more fun than a Trump rally?\"\n\nSupporters, doing the wave and thrusting Trump 2020 posters toward visiting Trump world celebrities including the social media personalities Diamond and Silk, did not seem to think so.\n\nDan Weddig, who drove over 100 miles from Gladstone, Mich., with his wife, Pam, enduring snowstorm warnings to attend, said he was happy to be part of the counterprogramming effort.\n\n\"It's kind of in your face,\" Mr. Weddig, 63, said of the dinner. \"It's a bunch of reporters and news people patting each other on the back.\"\n\nAside from the reliable digs at the news media -- images of Mr. Trump, dressed as a professional wrestling character and body-slamming a CNN logo, flashed across the Jumbotron before the president's appearance -- the rally was subdued for several stretches. During a more than hourlong speech, the president focused on policy and promises kept to a state that will be among the toughest in the country for Republicans to protect entering the 2020 election.\n\nMr. Trump first offered condolences for those killed and injured during a shooting at a California synagogue, then continued by heavily emphasizing trade relations with China, the healthy economy and his preferences on Federal Reserve policy. At times, the president had to rouse the crowd to the usual noise levels by deploying a reliable set of keywords: \"Democrats,\" \"the media,\" \"the swamp.\"\n\nThe less raucous rally was perhaps partly because of what is politically at stake for Republicans in Wisconsin, where three recent presidential elections were decided by the closest margins in the country. It is already presenting itself as a prime battleground territory before 2020, with Democrats planning to have their convention next year in Milwaukee.\n\nOne of the most visible industries here is also in peril. Dairy farmers in the state known for its cheese are reeling from the president's trade wars as over 1,200 farms have stopped milking cows. But when Mr. Trump said his administration's repeal of the estate tax would help farmers, the crowd still cheered.\n\nTailoring his speech to Midwesterners on the shores of Lake Michigan, Mr. Trump trumpeted local victories. He praised armored vehicle manufacturers in Oshkosh, and told the crowd his administration was earmarking $300 million to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. (His budget calls for cutting the program by 90 percent this year.)\n\n\"Now you finally have a president that is loyal to you,\" Mr. Trump said, mostly reserving mockery for his prospective opponents.\n\n\"Can you imagine Sleepy Joe, Crazy Bernie?\" he asked. \"Can you imagine any of those people up here doing what I'm doing?\"\n\nAs he attacked the usual hit list of Democrats, journalists and prospective 2020 presidential candidates, Mr. Trump detailed his policy victories and denounced his perceived enemies for any setbacks or losses. He again blamed John McCain, the Republican senator of Arizona, for dismantling a Republican plan to overhaul the health care system.\n\n\"We should've had health care,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But one man decided to vote against it.\"\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill Mr. McCain voted down would have led to the loss of health care for over 16 million people. Still, the crowd cheered.\n\nMr. Trump blamed the Federal Reserve for slowing the country's economic growth by avoiding quantitative easing. And he blamed the Democrats for just about everything else, be it abortion policy or immigration laws, deploying the usual attacks.\n\nThe president, who spent his morning golfing near Washington with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, also disparaged the special counsel's investigation into his campaign as \"collusion delusion.\" Over the last week, the administration signaled weeks of bitter fighting ahead as it resisted requests for documents and testimony in a bid to block multiple investigations by Democratic lawmakers in the House.\n\nAfter the White House said it would tell various people in the president's orbit to defy subpoenas, it said late Friday that one such official, Carl Kline, a former personnel security director, would testify before a House committee about how security clearances had been handled.\n\nDuring his speech on Saturday, as he revisited his favorite rally anecdotes, like moving the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and calling world leaders to complain about how much American aid was costing the country, Mr. Trump paused and remarked on the crowd's enthusiasm.\n\n\"You know why we're having a good time?\" Mr. Trump said. \"Because we're talking about a subject that we love, the United States of America.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_rogers@nytimes.com", "name": "Katie Rogers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/27/multimedia/27dc-trump/merlin_154083459_b33459ab-7527-4b14-90e4-0344cc0b4cc7-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4754306", "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 294117720}, {"uri": "1122641560", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-27", "time": "10:19:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-27T10:19:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.9607843160629272, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/hardline-views-made-lou-dobbs-a-fox-powerhouse-now-hes-shaping-trumps-border-policy/2019/04/26/cb8ebd6c-5fa4-11e9-bfad-36a7eb36cb60_story.html", "title": "Hardline views made Lou Dobbs a Fox powerhouse. Now he's shaping Trump's border policy.", "body": "By Manuel Roig-Franzia and Manuel Roig-Franzia Feature reporter Robert Costa Robert Costa National political reporter covering the White House, Congress and campaigns April 27 at 6:00 AM\n\nOne day in mid-March, President Trump gathered his top economic team at the White House to get its read on the state of the nation's financial health.\n\nBut before the Council of Economic Advisers finished its annual get-together with the nation's chief executive, a basso profundo voice thundered into the room via speakerphone. With the council sitting by, Trump had placed a call to his unofficial policy whisperer -- Lou Dobbs, the Fox Business Network host. The call ushered Dobbs into a traditionally private gathering, shielded from the media and investors eager to get a crystal-ball view of what lies ahead.\n\nThe Dobbs-Trump mind meld on display that day is emblematic of a White House where the unusual has become the norm. Day by day, the relationship between the bombastic president and the cranky anchorman has become an object of curiosity and amusement. But it is also something much more profound.\n\nAn echo chamber on ideology and policy has evolved; Trump often takes steps urged by Dobbs, such as declaring a national emergency to pay for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, pushing out Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and pulling back from a proposed cessation of the trade war with China.\n\nBorn just nine months apart, the 70-somethings share a penchant for schoolyard-style name-calling, grumbling about enemies seen and unseen, an apocalyptic view of illegal immigration and a deep embrace of hair-color shades not found in the natural world.\n\nDobbs and Trump, among the most vocal border hawks in recent American history, also both happen to be married to women with recent immigrant heritages. First lady Melania Trump emigrated from Slovenia, and Dobbs's wife, former CNN sports reporter Debi Lee Segura, is from a family with Mexican American roots.\n\nTrump's call to Dobbs in March was extraordinary. Four former council chairmen for Trump's predecessors, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, told The Washington Post the presidents they served under never called a member of the media during their briefings.\n\n\"This behavior by President Trump is certainly odd,\" said Jason Furman, who chaired the council under Obama from 2013 to 2017.\n\nHarvey S. Rosen, who chaired the council in 2005, said Bush never made such calls either, but added, \"the president is entitled to seek advice from whomever he wants and whenever he wants.\"\n\nTrump's council chairman, Kevin Hassett, revealed Trump's call to Dobbs, without going into detail about what was said, on Dobbs's show not long afterward. Hassett confirmed in an interview this week with The Washington Post that the president had \"a short, friendly call where we shared information with Lou that the president knew he'd be interested in.\"\n\nIn public, Trump and Dobbs have engaged in a kind of lovefest. In a much-discussed October 2017 interview of Trump, Dobbs gushed, \"You have accomplished so much\" in his introduction and signed off by adding, \"You are, if I may say, everything as advertised as you ran for president.\" A left-leaning columnist dubbed the sit-down \"a masterpiece of sycophancy.\"\n\nTrump, in turn, typically refers to the television host as \"The Great Lou Dobbs.\" At the New Year's Eve gala at Mar-a-Lago two months later, the president asked Dobbs to stand and be recognized: \"I just wanted to tell you, you are fantastic and we appreciate it,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's affection for all things Fox is well-established, as demonstrated by his metronomic references to the morning program \"Fox & Friends\" and his private chats and cheerleading for prime-time Fox News host Sean Hannity. But in Dobbs, Trump also finds a certain special wisdom.\n\n\"Lou's opinion is very important to the president,\" said Ed Rollins, the longtime Republican strategist who chairs a Trump super PAC and is a frequent guest on the 7 p.m. Eastern program \"Lou Dobbs Tonight.\"\n\n[Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen leaving Trump administration amid surge of migrants]\n\nClose associates of both Trump and Dobbs say they speak off-air often -- as frequently as every day some weeks. Just this week, Trump tweeted he'd spoken to Dobbs, whose program features a backdrop of an enormous fluttering American flag. The president urged his tens of millions of Twitter followers to watch the Fox Business stalwart's show that night, which turned out to be the start of a new series with Dobbs alleging \"radical Dems, the Deep State and the national left-wing media have tried to subvert and overthrow the president of the United States.\"\n\n\"While the president and Lou are friendly, it's not like his relationship with a lot of other people in the media who like him,\" said Stephen K. Bannon, Trump's former White House chief strategist. \"This is about policy. They're completely in sync on immigration and trade and what that all means for wages and how the Republican elite has failed.\"\n\nLou Dobbs of Fox Business Network speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2017. (Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nDobbs declined to be interviewed for this story. But Trump was more than happy to talk about Dobbs after being contacted by The Post, calling the veteran anchor's commentaries about the border \"very powerful.\"\n\n\"Lou has a very strong opinion on the border, and I do listen to that opinion,\" Trump said in a phone interview Tuesday evening from the Oval Office.\n\nThe president who was once a reality TV star has found in Dobbs something akin to a television avatar, a mutually beneficial embodiment of the presidential id, according to people close to both men.\n\n\"I think he respects what I'm doing, and I respect the job he does,\" Trump said. \"He really gets the word out. There's no question about it.\"\n\nA friend of Dobbs, who requested anonymity to speak frankly, said the TV host is well aware his show has become \"Trump 2020 TV,\" almost an unofficial extension of the president's reelection campaign.\n\nBut Dobbs \"doesn't care,\" the friend said. \"He's at the end of his career, and he's going to do what he wants to do.\"\n\n'There was anger'\n\nDobbs and Trump come from different universes. The president was born into wealth in 1946, the scion of a New York real estate empire. Dobbs, born the year before, speaks of growing up \"poor,\" with a father who moved the family to Idaho after his Texas business failed.\n\nDobbs first worked in government anti-poverty programs, then in financial services, before entering the local television business in Arizona and Washington state. There he found his calling, leveraging an authoritative aura, a thunderous voice and a straight-from-Central-Casting anchorman look.\n\nA recruiter lured him to something new launching in 1980 -- a 24-hour cable news network named CNN. Dobbs became one of the network's original stars, eventually taking on multiple roles as an executive, and anchoring the successful program, \"Moneyline with Lou Dobbs.\"\n\nIn 1999, his long tenure imploded spectacularly in a fit of pique when Dobbs ordered his crew to cut away from then-President Bill Clinton's speech in Colorado after the Columbine school shooting massacre. When CNN executives forced Dobbs to go back to the speech, he peevishly announced on air that \"CNN President Rick Kaplan wants us to return to Littleton.\"\n\nWithin days, Dobbs left CNN to form Space.com. He returned two years later from his ill-fated venture to CNN, where he was given control over his show's content.\n\nIt was during these years Dobbs made a turn, morphing from a straight albeit right-leaning newsman into an anti-illegal immigration firebrand. His show became a nightly drumbeat of border stories, a forum for groups such as the vigilante Minutemen border enforcers.\n\nDobbs railed about an \"invasion of illegal aliens\" and broadcast pieces with shaky or misleading factual foundations. He said in 2003 that \"illegal aliens\" constituted one-third of the total prison population, a claim he later retracted. He promoted claims in 2005 that 7,000 people with leprosy had immigrated here in three years -- when, in fact, that number covered 30 years.\n\nSome of Dobbs's associates theorized he was crassly capitalizing on the market for conservative viewers Fox News had so deftly recognized.\n\n\"He has always known where the money was -- the voice of the anxious American on immigration,\" Soledad O'Brien, a former CNN star whose mother is a black Cuban American, said in an interview.\n\n[Soledad O'Brien on Starbucks and race: \"It's okay to ask and it's okay to answer\"]\n\nLatino journalists at CNN were so alarmed that they demanded a meeting in the early 2000s at headquarters in Atlanta. In the heated session, some correspondents said they did not want to appear on Dobbs's program. There were also complaints because Dobbs repeatedly used the term \"illegal alien,\" which many Latinos find offensive, while it was general practice at the network to say \"undocumented person.\"\n\n\"There was anger. There was frustration,\" said Rose Arce, then a CNN producer who attended the meeting and is from a Peruvian family. \"They felt like they were being used.\"\n\nThe suits listened to the complaints, but nothing significant changed, attendees said.\n\n\"I was horrified,\" Maria Hinojosa, a star correspondent who was at the meeting and was the network's first Latina reporter, said. \"It was destroying the credibility of our profession.\"\n\nHinojosa sees far-reaching repercussions from that era.\n\n\"He and CNN helped to create the structure, ethos, imagery and tone of where we are n\n\nLou Dobbs on the set of his CNN show, \"Lou Dobs Tonight,\" in 2005. (MARK HILL/AP)\n\now,\" Hinojosa said. \"He helped to create the narrative that immigrants are bad, that they are lawbreakers and dangerous.\"\n\nAt CNN, Dobbs was generating solid ratings, even as some executives were growing more uncomfortable with his rhetoric. By 2009, tensions were flaring. A top former CNN insider said executives were ill at ease about Dobbs using his radio show on a separate network to focus attention on questions about the discredited theory, known as \"birtherism,\" that President Obama was not born in the United States.\n\nThe end for Dobbs at CNN came around the time the network released a major documentary titled \"Latino in America\" that showed immigrants in a positive light, and was spearheaded by O'Brien. BastaDobbs, a protest movement using the Spanish words for Stop Dobbs, was spawned around the idea it was hypocritical for CNN to promote O'Brien's production while also giving such an important forum to Dobbs, who the demonstrators accused of spreading lies and misinformation.\n\nAccording to the CNN insider, executives were more concerned about reining in Dobbs than the protests. A strategy emerged to neutralize him. Even though Dobbs had control over content, he still had to adhere to CNN standards. So, the network changed its standards, forcing anchors to abide by the same prohibitions on expressing opinions on air that had previously only applied to correspondents.\n\nThe same day the new standards were shown to Dobbs, he set in motion negotiations to get him out of his contract, according to the CNN insider.\n\nBy November 2009, Dobbs had resigned.\n\nSoledad O'Brien got his old office.\n\n'More Breitbart than Breitbart'\n\nDobbs may have worn out his welcome at CNN, but there were powerful people who saw greater things ahead. Bannon -- the future chief executive of Trump's 2016 campaign -- tried to persuade Dobbs to run for president in 2012.\n\n\"He was Trump before Trump,\" said Bannon, who ran the right-wing site Breitbart News. \"He has always sort of epitomized the intellectual foundation of the Trump movement on trade and immigration, even if he doesn't get enough attention. He was more Breitbart than Breitbart, going back years.\"\n\nDobbs decided against an Oval Office run. In 2010, he took a job at the Fox Business Network. It was a big step down to an offshoot network from the broader platform of CNN. Yet in the years since, he's become the most-watched host on business television, a position he's held since before Trump took office, according to the network, which says he's also had good ratings with Hispanics.\n\n[Bannon molded Breitbart into a far-right sledgehammer.]\n\nDuring Dobbs's early years at Fox Business, Trump didn't have a close relationship with him. But Dobbs had caught the New York developer's eye by frequently reporting on birtherism, a topic Trump took up with gusto in 2011 as he began hinting at a run for president.\n\n\"Trump echoed those concerns as he began to make inroads with Republican base voters,\" said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide.\n\nAs Trump got more serious about his presidential run, he began absorbing Dobbs's thoughts on China and immigration.\n\n\"He gets it,\" Trump told Nunberg.\n\nOnce the campaign began, aides and friends noticed Trump often had Dobbs's show on the screen in the jet they'd nicknamed Trump Force One. It wasn't unusual for Trump to dial up Dobbs.\n\n\"Trump cares about Fox, but he doesn't care about Fox Business,\" Nunberg said. \"He cares about Lou Dobbs.\"\n\nOn his nightly show the month before the election, Dobbs urged Americans to \"rouse themselves from a long slumber .\u2009.\u2009. and vote. Vote for your country or lose it. That's where we are.\"\n\nBut on Election Day, it appears one of those who didn't follow that advice was Dobbs himself. According to records at the Sussex County Board of Elections in New Jersey, where Dobbs lives, the broadcaster did not cast a vote in the 2016 general presidential election. Asked in writing about not voting in that election, as well as the 2008 presidential primary, Dobbs declined to comment through a Fox Business Network spokesperson.\n\n'The Dobbs effect'\n\nFresh off President Trump's January 2017 inauguration, his inner circle noticed most televisions in the West Wing of the White House had four channels airing simultaneously: Fox News, MSNBC, CNN, and Bloomberg.\n\nAides clamored to watch what the big boss was watching, so the White House Communications Agency, which operates those televisions, changed the box reserved for Bloomberg to Fox Business.\n\n\"It was the Dobbs effect,\" said an official familiar with the discussions.\n\nAs the months went along, the president's punching bags became Dobbs's punching bags. Dobbs called former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who has clashed frequently with Trump, \"feckless,\" \"an annoying son of a gun,\" \"a K Street-owned RINO\" and an \"ignoramus\" -- and that was during just one show last November. Ryan declined comment through a spokesman.\n\nThe phenomenon of Trump and Dobbs as almost a single brain connected not by neurons, but by cable wires, has been reinforced by repetition.\n\nThe president has what he calls a \"Super TiVo,\" a system in which he records programs so he can watch them whenever and wherever he wants. Suddenly, it was almost impossible to be in Trump's orbit without seeing Dobbs's face.\n\nCNN host Lou Dobbs is confronted by protesters and escorted by police during a march on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday in New York in 2008. (Chip East/Reuters)\n\nDobbs is often playing on Air Force One and in the presidential dining room, according to a supporter who has spent time in both places with Trump but was not authorized to speak publicly. It's not uncommon, the supporter said, for Trump to pause mid-conversation and turn up the volume to catch something Dobbs is saying.\n\n\"I respect his commentary -- I would say, based not on my talking to him but my listening, that he feels very strongly about strength at the border, and so do I,\" Trump told The Post.\n\n[The perilous high-wire act of writing speeches for Donald Trump]\n\nManaging Dobbs can be treacherous. Former deputy White House chief of staff Bill Shine, a onetime top Fox News executive, strained to reassure Dobbs that Trump would follow through on promises to take dramatic immigration measures. A White House official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said Trump grew frustrated with Shine as Dobbs carried on with monologues saying Trump was not taking a hard enough line on immigration.\n\n\"The president noticed that, and that was the start of Bill's problems, in some ways,\" the official said.\n\nThe firebrand anchor was pushing for quick action.\n\n\"This is the president of the United States,\" Dobbs told his audience in January. \"He says a wall should be built. That it's a national emergency. At that point the nation should rally behind him.\"\n\nA month later, Dobbs got his wish: the president declared a national emergency.\n\nShine, in office for just eight months, was out of a job before the national emergency went to a vote in Congress.\n\nEven after the national emergency declaration, Dobbs was grumpy. He set his sights on Nielsen, the beleaguered DHS secretary, who'd managed to anger immigrant advocates who thought she was too tough and the president who was pushing her to be tougher.\n\nIn early March, Dobbs was asking, \"Why doesn't Trump fire Kirstjen Nielsen?\"\n\nWithin weeks Nielsen was announcing her resignation.\n\nMany Trump allies say Dobbs's repeated criticism of Nielsen, more than anything else, made her position untenable in the administration.\n\n\"Think about it,\" said one ally who works closely with the administration on immigration and requested anonymity to speak candidly. \"Every night at 7 p.m. on Fox you're getting slammed by Lou as the president watches.\"\n\n'What time is it on, again?'\n\nAs Dobbs's influence with the White House has seemed to grow, some Washington power players who'd barely paid attention to him have been forced to take notice.\n\n\"He matters because the president watches,\" a White House official said. \"Members of Congress who figure that out, will ask us, 'What time is it on, again?'\u2009\"\n\nBut at the White House, where Trump keeps his Super TiVo humming, the time doesn't matter because the president can watch whenever he likes. The April 10 show gave Trump something he loved.\n\nThe anchor featured a poll showing Trump with a 55 percent approval rating. Trump tweeted an image of the graphic and wrote, \"Great news! #MAGA.\"\n\nIt turns out that poll actually showed 55 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view of the president, and only 41 percent viewed him favorably. Amid an uproar of condemnation, Fox Business corrected the error.\n\nBut two weeks later, the false poll results live on, undeleted and uncorrected -- they're right there on Trump's Twitter timeline, for all to see.

This month, after years of falling milk prices and mounting debt, the Murrays sold their last milk cow, taking pictures while holding back tears as the final one was loaded onto a truck and taken away.\n\n\"It's awful hard to see them go out the last time,\" said Ms. Murray, 53. \"It's scary because you don't know what your next paycheck is going to be.\"\n\nWisconsin is known as \"America's Dairyland,\" but the milk makers who gave the state its moniker are vanishing, falling prey to a variety of impediments, including President Trump and his global trade war.\n\nOver the past two years, nearly 1,200 of the state's dairy farms have stopped milking cows and so far this year, another 212 have disappeared, with many shifting production to beef or vegetables. The total number of herds in Wisconsin is now below 8,000 -- about half as many as 15 years ago. In 2018, 49 Wisconsin farms filed for bankruptcy -- the highest of any state in the country, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\nThe fate of Wisconsin's farmers is a high-stakes political predicament for Mr. Trump, who narrowly won the pivotal swing state in 2016 and hopes to keep it red in 2020. On Saturday, Mr. Trump will travel to Green Bay, Wis., for a campaign rally where he is expected to trumpet his trade policies, like the revised North American Free Trade Agreement, which is supposed to bolster American dairy exports to Canada.\n\nBut Mr. Trump's trade approach has pushed many of Wisconsin's already struggling dairy farmers to the edge. Milk prices have fallen nearly 40 percent over the past five years, the byproduct of economic and technological forces that have made milk easier to produce and state policies that ramped up production and sent prices tumbling.\n\nThat has coincided with Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, which were intended to help American manufacturers but have set off retaliatory tariffs from Mexico, Canada, Europe and China on American dairy products. Most painful for Wisconsin's dairy farmers has been a 25 percent tariff that Mexico placed on American cheese, which is made with a significant volume of the state's milk production.\n\nMr. Trump has insisted that any short-term pain from his trade war will pay off in the long run through improved access to foreign markets. And he has tried to mitigate the effect by providing federal aid to farmers whose products have been hurt by the trade war. But the crumbling of Wisconsin's flagship dairy industry has some farmers questioning whether Mr. Trump's promises will come true in time to save their farms.\n\n\"Low dairy prices have made it so hard for small farms to hang on,\" said Josh Murray, 22, who is studying animal science and helping his family try to transition the farm to beef. While the Murrays received about $400 from Mr. Trump's farm aid program, it was not enough to keep their milking operations afloat.\n\n\"In every aspect, it's not worth it -- it's not worth the fight,\" he said.\n\nFor many farmers who have been transitioning away from milk to other products, the trade wars have been the final straw. The warning signs have been flashing for a while, as milk prices declined precipitously in the last five years to below $17 per 100 pounds from almost $26. The rise of corporate farms and more efficient milking processes have led to an oversupply as consumption of milk has waned nationally.\n\nThe new North American trade deal, which is supposed to give dairy farmers more access to Canada's tightly controlled market, has yet to be ratified by Congress and may never be approved given Democratic opposition. And Mr. Trump has yet to remove his metal tariffs on trading partners like Europe, Canada and Mexico, which refuse to lift their retaliatory tariffs until those levies come off.\n\nFarmer advocacy groups say policies enforced by former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, exacerbated the problem. In 2012, Mr. Walker, who was defeated in 2018 by a Democrat, put into place a program to encourage dairy farmers to step up production with the goal of producing 30 billion pounds of milk a year by 2020. That was easily accomplished by 2016, but the oversupply crippled the industry.\n\n\"He wanted to put Wisconsin back into the lead in milk production over California,\" said Joel Greeno, a dairy farmer and the president of the Wisconsin advocacy group Family Farm Defenders. \"It was more an example of arrogance than practicality.\"\n\nMr. Walker declined to comment.\n\nMr. Greeno said that for all of Mr. Trump's protectionist tendencies, he has been a disappointment for farmers by not aiming tariffs on imported products like milk protein concentrate that would protect the American dairy industry and make imports more expensive. Many farmers favor the idea of a supply management program for dairy like the one Canada uses, but the Trump administration has not supported such a program.\n\nThe agricultural woes in Wisconsin are a microcosm of the difficulties that farmers across the country have faced as a result of the multifront trade disputes that have lingered for more than a year. In 2018, farm income nationally was $63.1 billion, the second-lowest total in a decade. Commerce Department figures released on Friday suggested that farmers were not anticipating much relief, as purchases of agricultural equipment were tepid.\n\nA report last year from the U.S. Dairy Export Council estimated that over the next several years, retaliatory tariffs by China and Mexico could cut American dairy exports by $2.7 billion and lower dairy farmers' revenues by $16.6 billion if they were not rolled back.\n\n\"He's talked over time about how much he cares about these dairy farmers, but he hasn't really followed up with any certainty,\" Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, said of Mr. Trump in an interview. \"Our farmers need good trade deals, not trade wars.\"\n\nRepresentative Mike Gallagher, a Republican from the Wisconsin district that includes Green Bay, said he had urged the White House to roll back the steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Trump had imposed on Canada and Mexico so that farmers in his state could get relief. He said that the top concerns of dairy farmers were the tariffs, along with Mr. Trump's immigration policies, which make finding farm labor more difficult.\n\n\"Wisconsin farmers are caught in the crossfire,\" Mr. Gallagher said.\n\nThe financial strain proved too much for the Voelker family in Rice Lake, a town of fewer than 10,000 people in western Wisconsin. The Voelkers sold 20 milk cows this year and the remaining 40 are expected to be gone by September, as the farm transitions to producing grain and crops. Cows that used to sell for $2,000 each a few years ago are now worth only $800. The hope is that by getting out now, they can save a family farm purchased in 1940.\n\n\"It's stressful; it's emotional,\" said Jamie Voelker, 61. \"There's generations of sweat and blood and tops of fingers.\"\n\nThe political implications for Mr. Trump remain unclear. Wisconsin remains very much split when it comes to support for the president. In the 2000, 2004 and 2016 presidential elections, Wisconsin was decided by a margin of less than one percentage point. Mr. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by nearly 23,000 votes, making the state a hotly contested battleground.\n\nThe president is aware of the importance of Wisconsin and regularly says that the new Nafta will be a boon for the state's dairy farmers. In January, at the American Farm Bureau Federation's convention in New Orleans, Mr. Trump even mentioned by name a Wisconsin dairy farm family that was in attendance and professed his affection for the state.\n\nDemocrats are hopeful that Mr. Walker's defeat signals Wisconsin could become a blue state again in 2020. A poll released this week by Zogby Analytics buttressed those hopes, with Democratic candidates like Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. holding large leads against Mr. Trump in hypothetical matchups. On Friday, Priorities USA, the progressive super PAC, announced a six-figure digital advertising campaign in Wisconsin to make the case that voters have been left behind by the president's economic policies.\n\nIn the meantime, Wisconsin's farmers are trying to hang on. The Murrays are hopeful that raising beef cattle will be more profitable and less arduous than producing milk.\n\n\"You love the land, you love to watch things grow,\" Ms. Murray said. \"When it's something you're born doing, it's hard to say you're not going to do it anymore.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alan_rappeport@nytimes.com", "name": "Alan Rappeport", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/25/business/00dc-wisconsin5/00dc-wisconsin5-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4748614", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 294008520}, {"uri": "1122118140", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-26", "time": "15:38:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-26T15:38:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/04/26/us-economy-grew-percent-early-smashing-expectations/", "title": "U.S. economy grew 3.2 percent in early 2019, smashing expectations", "body": "The strong growth was driven by factors that economists don't think will last.\n\nPinterest Inc. signage is displayed outside of the New York Stock Exchange during the company's initial public offering (IPO) on April 18, 2019.

By Heather Long Heather Long Economics correspondent April 26 at 9:49 AM\n\nThe U.S. economy expanded at a strong 3.2 percent annualized rate from January through March, the government reported Friday, blowing past expectations and causing elation among President Trump and his advisers even though some economists warn growth was high because of companies beefing up their inventories and a smaller trade deficit, factors unlikely to persist.\n\nBetter-than-expected growth, the ongoing strength in the job market and fresh stock market highs this week are allaying fears that a recession or severe downturn is on the horizon. The slowdown in Europe and China appear to have had little effect on the United States so far.\n\n\"The economy is not slowing nearly as much as people think,\" said Neil Dutta, head of economics at RenMac Research. \"A 3.2 percent pace cannot be sustained, but the Federal Reserve and markets have probably cut their growth estimates too far for this year.\"\n\n[A U.S. recession looks less likely in 2020, boosting Trump's chances of reelection]\n\nMany economists initially predicted anemic growth at the start of the year as the partial government shutdown and a rash of extremely cold weather caused many businesses and consumers to hit the pause button on big purchases, but forecasters raised their estimates to 2.3 percent as it became clear companies were re-stocking their shelves. Growth ended up coming in almost a full percentage point higher than expected, the best start to the year since 2015.\n\nA debate is now underway about what will happen the rest of this year and early next year, a key moment when many Americans are likely to take stock of how the economy is doing ahead of the election.\n\nOver half of the strong first quarter growth was driven by a surge in inventories and U.S. exports to other nations, many economists pointed out, an unusual situation since consumer and business spending normally propels growth. A jump in state and local government spending also boosted growth by the biggest amount in three years.\n\n\"Businesses were building inventories like crazy. That is not going to last,\" said Ben Herzon, executive director at Marcoeconomic Advisers. \"The first quarter number is overstating the strength of the economy.\"\n\n[Trump administration pushes for quick action to raise debt limit]\n\nTrump has vowed he can get the U.S. economy growing at an annual pace of 3 percent -- or better -- for the next decade. By one growth calculation he achieved that goal last year after the tax cuts and additional government spending spurred more consumer and business spending. But whether the economy can sustain that pace up is an open question.\n\nAs the president flew to Indiana to speak at a National Rifle Association conference, he hailed the economic news, saying it was \"incredible,\" \"great,\" and \"we're knocking it out of the park.\"\n\nMost experts, including the Federal Reserve which has been a frequent target of Trump's ire, have been saying growth is likely to come in closer to 2 percent this year, more in line with the Obama years. But some independent forecasters are moving their estimates toward 2.5 percent as they see an improving outlook.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund recently predicted growth would pick up in the second half of the year for the world economy and likely the United States, propelled by the expected resolution of the U.S.-China trade war and the Fed's decision to hold off on raising interest rates.\n\n[S&P 500, Nasdaq climb back to all-time highs. Can it last?]\n\nThe president's top economic advisers say they are revising their forecasts even higher for the year after looking through the data. They believe growth would have been 3.5 percent in the first quarter without the shutdown and that consumption will pick up later this year.\n\n\"Right now we would be inclined to increase our forecasts. Not only was last year not a sugar high, but it appears the economy is accelerating,\" said Kevin Hassett, head of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nA key conundrum is that first quarter growth is typically the weakest of the year, but this year is likely to be different, experts say.\n\nAfter a big buying spree in the winter, companies are unlikely to keep expanding their inventory this spring, meaning second quarter growth could take a hit. The unusual jump in U.S. exports is also likely to be hard to sustain. If the trade deficit widens in the second quarter, that would also be a drag on growth.\n\nBusiness spending, which the White House said the tax cuts would boost, came in at 2.7 percent, a modest pace with almost not spending on equipment or buildings. There's hope that if Trump ends the trade war with China soon, businesses might be more eager to spend again.\n\n\"There's no evidence that business investment has ratcheted up to a new higher level as a result of tax reform,\" said Dean Maki, chief economist at Point72 Asset Management. \"Still, it has been relatively steady.\"\n\n(Heather Long/BEA)\n\nHassett said the president's top economic priority at the moment is closing trade deals with China and Europe and getting Congress to pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the revised North American Free Trade Agreement deal.\n\nU.S. consumers are likely to be the key factor in whether the economy has a normal, subpar or extraordinary year since consumer spending drives about 70 percent of growth. Spending on goods and services was relatively weak at the start of the year. While overall growth came in at 3.2 percent, final sales to U.S. purchasers, a measure of domestic demand, was only 1.4 percent.\n\nAmericans sharply pulled back in spending at the end of last year, but there are signs they started buying again in March, which should create a spring bounce to keep the economy expanding at a decent pace. For the past several years this trend has played out with weaker spending in the first quarter and stronger spending in the spring and summer.\n\nWages, especially for lower income Americans, are rising above 3 percent and faster than the cost of living as companies have to boost wages to attract and retain workers and many states have increased their minimum wages. Consumer sentiment also remains high despite the ongoing drama in the White House.\n\nFifty-three percent of consumers reported an improvement in their personal finances in April, according to the latest University of Michigan Survey of Consumers released Friday, which is the highest average since 1999 and should help motivate Americans to keep spending.\n\nDespite ongoing robust growth, inflation has remained below 2 percent in recent months and shows signs of moving lower, which should keep the economy from overheating and the Fed from raising interest rates any higher.\n\n\"It looks like the Goldilocks scenario of strong growth and benign inflation is still happening, much like the 1990s,\" said Dutta, the economist at RenMac Research.\n\nRelated:\n\nThe data is in: More Americans received tax refunds in 2019, but checks were leaner\n\nA U.S. recession looks less likely in 2020, boosting Trump's chances of reelection\n\nTax Day 2019: Did the GOP tax bill live up to its promises?", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yfsVlsEojz-gsdXAxdaVOGUvUkY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TYL3ARDG2YI6TJUYFKHYBDE47M.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4751129", "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 293989080}, {"uri": "1119966884", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-24", "time": "08:12:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-24T08:12:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5882353186607361, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/business/europe-us-tariffs-trade-war.html", "title": "Europe Not Feeling Much Pain From Trump Tariffs, Central Bank Says", "body": "FRANKFURT -- President Trump's trade war was supposed to make Europeans feel so much pain they would beg for mercy at the negotiating table. But it's not working very well, according to a new study by the European Central Bank.\n\nAlmost a year after the White House imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminum, the actual damage to European exports has been surprisingly mild, according to the study, released on Wednesday.\n\nSome industries, notably manufacturers of heavy equipment, may have even profited. That is because the White House imposed a broader array of tariffs on Chinese products, making competing European goods less expensive by comparison and allowing them to gain market share.\n\nThe tariffs \"pose only a modest adverse risk to the global and euro area outlooks,\" said the study by Vanessa Gunnella and Lucia Quaglietti, who are economists at the European Central Bank.\n\nThe central bank's study, which comes as Europe and the United States prepare to begin high-level trade talks, reinforces other research showing that the tariffs on European goods have, by themselves, not amounted to very much. They have probably hurt the United States economy more than the intended targets.\n\nOne reason is that much of the steel that Europeans sell to the United States is specially formulated for specific uses, like aircraft parts or oil drilling equipment. American companies cannot find domestic suppliers able to provide the same products, which often contain patented combinations of minerals or other metals. So they simply wind up paying the tariffs of 10 percent on aluminum and 25 percent on steel and passing the extra cost on to American consumers.\n\n\"There was not necessarily a lot of production capacity in the U.S. to pick up the slack,\" said Oliver Rakau, chief German economist at Oxford Economics, who was not involved in the central bank study.\n\nAt the same time, the trade war is having a significant psychological impact. Mr. Trump has rattled European confidence with the tariffs and his threats to expand the levies to include cars. Fearful of what may come next, business people are delaying plans to expand their factories or hire new workers.\n\n\"Uncertainty related to protectionism is weighing on economic sentiment,\" the central bank study said, adding that was only one of the reasons for Europe's tepid growth.\n\nMany economists have said that putting tariffs on cars would raise the stakes significantly and cause a lot more damage.\n\nAs part of their study, which appears in the European Central Bank's monthly bulletin, Ms. Gunnella and Ms. Quaglietti also calculated what would happen if the United States imposed 10 percent tariffs on imports from all countries, and if all of the countries hit by the tariffs retaliated in kind.\n\nThe United States economy would suffer the most damage in such a trade war because American products would become more expensive abroad, the central bank economists estimated. China would come out ahead.\n\nIn Europe, the damage to business confidence in the hypothetical trade war would largely be canceled out by increases in exports to countries other than the United States. European companies would be able to take market share from their American rivals in China.\n\nThere are already signs that European manufacturers of factory machinery, construction vehicles and other heavy equipment are exploiting Mr. Trump's trade war with China. Industrial machinery is Germany's second biggest category of exports after cars, and also an important sector in countries like the Netherlands and Italy.\n\nIn recent years Chinese companies have become more skilled at producing sophisticated machinery and challenging the dominance of European rivals. But White House tariffs on Chinese products have given the European companies at least a temporary price advantage.\n\nStill, few business managers are feeling good about the turmoil. \"Further trade conflicts would not be in our interest,\" Trumpf, a German company known for machines that use lasers to cut steel, said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe United States and China are Trumpf's two biggest foreign markets, and it has factories in both countries, the company noted.\n\n\"Things go well for Trumpf when things go well for China, the U.S.A. and Europe,\" the company said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_ewing@nytimes.com", "name": "Jack Ewing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/24/business/24EUROPETRADE-1/24EUROPETRADE-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4742429", "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 293789520}, {"uri": "1119594297", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-23", "time": "20:12:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-23T20:12:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/business/stock-market-record-high.html", "title": "Stocks Just Hit a Record.

Thank the Fed.\n\nThe bull market lives, thanks to the Federal Reserve's new, more relaxed approach to interest rates.\n\nBy Matt Phillips\n\nApril 23, 2019\n\nThe economy is softening, profit growth is slowing, and a trade war between the United States and China is grinding on.\n\nStock investors don't mind.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose to a record on Tuesday, surpassing a high last set in September. The day's gains topped off a rally that has pushed the stock benchmark up 17 percent this year.\n\nThat's the index's best start to a year since 1987, and one that has confounded those who anticipated that 2019 would be a difficult time for stocks. After all, fear of slowing growth and deteriorating corporate fundamentals -- the very same factors that investors are brushing off today -- helped trigger a stock market meltdown in December.\n\nThere is a clear reason for this change in tune. The rally began after the Federal Reserve all but promised investors that it wouldn't raise interest rates further and risk tipping the economy into a recession. Such \"easy\" monetary policy, to use the jargon of the markets, provides a helping hand to the economy and caps returns on bonds, the main investment alternative to stocks.\n\nBoth help buoy stock prices.\n\n\"All you've needed to know as an investor this year was whether monetary policy was going to be easy or not,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors. \"It really has been a major support for the market.\"\n\nRead more about the Federal Reserve and the stock marketFed, Dimming Its Economic Outlook, Predicts No Rate Increases This YearMarch 20, 2019The Fed's Rate-Raising Days Are Over. Wall Street Couldn't Be Happier.March 20, 2019\n\nThat support has touched almost every corner of the market. Speculative small caps, economically sensitive cyclical stocks, time-tested industrials, towering tech giants have all gained. The technology-focused Nasdaq index also rose to a record on Tuesday.\n\nSome of this gain is a rebound from December's 9 percent slide in the S&P 500. It has also helped that the earnings slowdown isn't coming as a surprise.\n\nGrowth in corporate profits was widely expected to ease, after earnings jumped more 22 percent in 2018 largely because of sharp cuts in corporate tax rates. Those lower rates remain in place and are no longer driving year-over-year growth.\n\n\"It wasn't sustainable,\" Mr. Arone said of last year's profit growth. Wall Street analysts now expect that full-year earnings will be up roughly 4 percent from last year.\n\nOf course, with the global economy slowing, companies might have a harder time clearing the lower earnings hurdles they now face. Economists expect the pace of growth in the United States to slow to 2.4 percent this year, down from nearly 3 percent in 2018.\n\nAmerica's peppy growth rate last year also was fueled by the tax cuts, as well as a boost in federal spending. While the economy remains healthy, the benefits of both are fading.\n\nAt the same time, the global economy is also losing steam, thanks in part to the ongoing trade fight between the United States and China. On April 9, the International Monetary Fund cut its growth forecast for the third time since October, citing the tensions between the world's two largest economies.\n\nBut investors have become more sanguine about the ongoing trade fight, with many seeing the lack of fresh tit-for-tat tariffs as an indication that the two countries will eventually come to some sort of an agreement.\n\n\"It does feel that both the U.S. and China want to post a win here,\" said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock.\n\nWhile this year's softer economic conditions are filtering into lower expectations for corporate profits, they're also reinforcing expectations that the Federal Reserve will refrain from increasing interest rates for the foreseeable future.\n\nAnalysts doubt that the current \"easy\" money policies alone will be enough to keep stocks moving higher. Even if the earnings picture improves significantly, a cooling-off period is overdue.\n\n\"It's hard to see the market extending too much from where we are,\" said Roger Aliaga-Diaz, chief economist at Vanguard. \"From a fundamental perspective, it's difficult to justify.\"\n\nAfter all, if the S&P 500 kept rising at the rate it did during the first quarter, it would be up more than 50 percent this year. That would make 2019 the best year in modern stock market history, just ahead of 1954's 45 percent gain.\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that the pace of gains is starting to slow, and the recent tepid returns could be a preview what investors should expect for the rest of the year, said Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.\n\n\"I think we've made the easy money,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_phillips@nytimes.com", "name": "Matt Phillips", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/23/business/23marketrecord1/23marketrecord1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.png", "eventUri": "eng-4745751", "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 293746320}]
