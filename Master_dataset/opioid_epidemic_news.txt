Five days later, he was unconscious in a hospital after an overdose, with five different prescription painkillers and an anti-anxiety drug in his bloodstream. He died the same day. He was 22 years old.\n\n\"I just cannot go there,\" she said of the town where her son played middle linebacker for the Sooners. \"It is too painful for me to go there.\"\n\nBox is convinced that a stiff financial penalty against drug companies will provide accountability for her son's death, as well as providing the treatment and other services substance users need.\n\n\"It's not going to mend my broken heart,\" she said. \"It's not going to stop me from mourning my son. But hopefully it will stop the mourning of other people's sons and daughters.\"\n\nMuch has changed since Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter sued three drug companies and their subsidiaries 23 months ago, alleging they are responsible for the opioid scourge.\n\nOklahoma linebacker Austin Box (12) celebrates an interception in the end zone during the Big 12 college football championship game in December 2010, in Arlington, Texas.

(Tony Gutierrez/AP)\n\nThe central character in the opioid epidemic, Purdue Pharma, has settled with the state for $270 million and will not be on trial in Judge Thad Balkman's courtroom. On Sunday, a second defendant, Teva Pharmaceuticals, settled out of court for $85 million. The state has dropped all but one accusation against the remaining company -- Johnson & Johnson -- and is pinning its strategy on a novel use of Oklahoma law.\n\n[Spotlight shifts to Johnson & Johnson as Oklahoma opioid trial nears]\n\nDuring two years of pretrial battles, the community of people who have lost loved ones to opioid overdoses or seen lives ruined by addiction has steadily grown larger. In Oklahoma and elsewhere, they are among those most interested in the outcome.\n\n\"It's a club nobody wanted to join,\" said Bill Guy, 69, an Oklahoma teachers union organizer whose 34-year-old son, Chris, died of a heroin overdose in 2016. He wants companies held accountable for deaths like his son's, and he wants to prevent future death and addiction. \"It's not about retribution for me.\"\n\nWhen compared to other states, Oklahoma's drug overdose rate of 20.1 per 100,000 residents is near the middle of the pack, far below West Virginia's rate of 57.8, but much worse than Nebraska's 8.1, according to 2017 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOverdose deaths from prescription opioids have plunged in Oklahoma since they peaked at 478 in 2012, according to state data. In 2017, 277 state deaths were attributed to the prescribed painkillers.\n\nThe state's total number of overdose deaths continues to climb gradually, however, led in recent years by alcohol, methamphetamine and illegal opioids such as fentanyl and heroin. In 2017, 743 people died of overdoses.\n\nLike more than 1,600 other states, cities, counties, Native American tribes and other groups that have filed lawsuits, Oklahoma contends that pharmaceutical companies sparked the crisis of the past two decades, ignoring the growing toll and, in some cases, deceptively promoting the drugs.\n\nOklahoma is seeking a penalty in the billions of dollars to \"abate\" the crisis, alleging it will take as much as $17.5 billion across the next 20 to 30 years to compensate for the damage. Its single charge is that the drug companies created a \"public nuisance,\" a violation historically alleged when one party's activities negatively affect others -- a neighborhood crack house or a factory that pollutes a waterway, as examples.\n\nThe companies have asserted that they responsibly marketed legitimate narcotics approved by the Food and Drug Administration to quell pain and cannot be linked to deaths from illegal abuse of the drugs.\n\nIn a statement released Friday, John Sparks, Oklahoma counsel for Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, said \"Janssen is confident it acted responsibly in the marketing and promotion of its products. Its FDA-approved medicines helped people in pain, and Janssen successfully worked with regulators to prevent diversion and abuse of its opioid medications.\"\n\nWith Balkman refusing to delay the Tuesday court date, Oklahoma's case is the first of more than 40 state lawsuits to come to trial and is being closely watched elsewhere.\n\nPurdue Pharma, the company widely blamed for sparking the epidemic with the 1996 introduction and promotion of its painkiller OxyContin, will not be seated among the defendants. The company settled with the state in March, agreeing to pay $270 million, much of which will fund a treatment and research institute at Oklahoma State University.\n\nMark McBride, an Oklahoma state representative from Moore, said many communities directly affected by the opioid crisis turned their attention away from the case in recent months when they learned most of the Purdue settlement would go to a school, rather than to localities. McBride and other legislators objected to the move, arguing they should have been allowed to decide how to spend the funds. He bemoaned the fact that cities and towns that have borne the brunt of crisis received just $12.5 million from Purdue.\n\n\"I don't think people really understand that there is something like this going on,\" McBride said of the trial. The funds from the Teva settlement will go to the state, and details on how to spend it are still being worked out.\n\nBecky O'Dell, executive director of Parents Helping Parents, a 1,200-member support group for Oklahoma parents of children with substance abuse disorders, said the members of her organization are keenly interested in holding drug companies responsible for the damage in Oklahoma.\n\n\"What I hear is they should be held accountable,\" she said. \"I think they just want the epidemic addressed. They just want the problem addressed.\"\n\nAustin Box was a star high school athlete in Enid, Okla., where he suffered the first of a string of football injuries, his mother said. He, his family and his doctors carefully managed pain control with over-the-counter drugs and physical therapy, using no opioids until he ruptured a disc in his spine before his senior year at Oklahoma in 2010, she said. He received morphine in the hospital and a prescription for one opioid painkiller, with no refills, when he was discharged.\n\nGail Box believes that's all it took for her son to become addicted. He began acquiring opioids from friends, she said, to manage his pain and the mental toll of the injuries. Her husband, Craig Box, declined to be interviewed because he could be called as a witness in the trial.\n\nAfter graduating on May 14, 2011, and returning home from a road trip with his father, Austin Box was found unconscious May 19 at a friend's home in El Reno. Medics and doctors could not save his life.\n\nGail and Craig Box have created a foundation in Austin's name and Gail speaks at gatherings across the state about four times a month. She also served on the board of the state's Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, where she met Hunter.\n\n\"I will continue to beat myself up for not realizing how dangerous opioids were, and are,\" she said. \"I want to send a message to the drug companies. They are responsible, they are directly responsible, for deaths as a result of not being totally honest [about] the addictive nature of prescription opioids.\"\n\nRead more\n\nSpotlight shifts to Johnson & Johnson as Oklahoma opioid trial nears\n\nOklahoma could provide first test of who will pay for the drug epidemic\n\nPurdue Pharma, Oklahoma settle landmark opioid lawsuit", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bfcx0j0CfoT8pcwqahUzD9jBBuw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IKTLF7UASUI6TFNJ4LEDBL7CJ4.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4815740", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 296677980}, {"uri": "1145963210", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-26", "time": "16:33:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-26T16:33:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/health/opioid-trial-oklahoma-johnsonandjohnson.html", "title": "First Opioid Trial Takes Aim at J & J", "body": "Having settled with Purdue Pharma and Teva, Oklahoma will now try to blame Johnson & Johnson for its opioid disaster. Nearly 1,900 lawsuits remain nationwide.\n\nDid the people who brought you baby powder and baby shampoo also bring you the opioid crisis?\n\nThat will be the question before an Oklahoma judge starting Tuesday, as the first civil trial takes off on the long, nationwide runway of trials against prescription opioid manufacturers, distributors and sellers. Oklahoma is squaring off against Johnson & Johnson, the New Jersey-based, family-friendly giant, which produces a fentanyl patch.\n\nOn Sunday, another defendant in the case, Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd., the Israel-based producer of generic medicines, including opioids, settled with Oklahoma for $85 million. Details of how the state will allocate the money have not yet been finalized.\n\nIn a statement, the company said, \"The settlement does not establish any wrongdoing on the part of the company; Teva has not contributed to the abuse of opioids in Oklahoma in any way.\"\n\nThere is great interest in the case, which originally included Purdue Pharma, and not only from lawyers in nearly 1,900 federal and state lawsuits who want to see how the evidence and legal strategies resonate.\n\n\"So much of the litigation has remained under seal or redacted that this will be the public's first glimpse into Pandora's box,\" said Elizabeth C. Burch, a law professor at the University of Georgia who writes about mass torts. \"Not only will a trial occur, but it will be televised.\"\n\nWhile the state has not said how much it is seeking, the Oklahoma attorney general, Mike Hunter, has said that companies have caused opioid-related damages worth billions of dollars. But Purdue Pharma already settled with the state in March for $270 million. With the company that has become embedded in the public's mind as an arch villain gone from the proceedings and Teva also out of the case, will Mr. Hunter be able to stick J & J with the rest of the bill?\n\nOklahoma, a largely rural state whose medical, social welfare and criminal justice systems have been ravaged by opioid addictions and deaths, has \"home court advantage,\" Ms. Burch said.\n\nBut the case is hardly a slam-dunk.\n\nThe challenge in all opioid cases is how to closely tie each defendant to the carnage.\n\nIn its attempt to frame that narrative, Oklahoma is relying on just one legal theory, which itself has an uneven record.\n\nThe theory -- that J & J violated public nuisance law -- is also being raised in the first federal cases to go to trial in Cleveland, Ohio, currently set for Oct. 21. All eyes will look to the Oklahoma trial as an out-of-town rehearsal for that big show. How will witnesses perform? Which arguments will resonate?\n\n\"If J & J prevails in Oklahoma, they may feel they are gaining leverage\" in the federal negotiations, said Alexandra D. Lahav, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law who is an expert on bellwether trials.\n\nThrough its pharmaceutical division, Janssen, J & J manufactured Nucynta, an opioid tablet, which it divested in 2015. It still makes Duragesic, a fentanyl patch. Teva produces Actiq and Fentora, for breakthrough cancer pain.\n\nThrough a company spokesman, J & J said that since 2008, its opioid medications have amounted annually to less than 1 percent of the opioid prescriptions written nationally. A Teva spokeswoman said its medications were administered infrequently in Oklahoma: Between 2007 and 2017, she said, the state reimbursed just 245 Actiq and Fentora prescriptions.\n\nThe case is a bench trial, heard before Judge Thad Balkman without a jury, but media attention and courtroom cameras will essentially render the public into a collective jury.\n\nPublicity heightens pressure. The case already has a political shadow: Not only is Mr. Hunter an elected official, but Judge Balkman, a former state legislator, is also elected.\n\nJ & J also has reason to be wary of the spotlight: It wants to protect its family-friendly branding. In redacted court documents, Oklahoma has accused J & J of targeting patient groups for opioid sales, including veterans, older adults and children.\n\nIn a statement, John Sparks, a lawyer for J & J and Janssen, said, \"Janssen did not market opioids to children, and the State's suggestion to the contrary is false and reckless.\" Instead, he continued, Janssen had designed a drug-abuse prevention program with a school nurse association.\n\nJ & J, with 2018 sales of $81.6 billion, is already waging a public-relations campaign as it continues to fight lawsuits alleging that its talc-based baby powder caused cancer in some consumers.\n\nIf Oklahoma is not ground zero for the emergency, it's \"certainly close,\" Mr. Hunter said recently during a panel on opioids at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. Between 2015 and 2018, he said, there were 18 million opioid prescriptions written in a state with a population of 3.9 million. In a 15-year period, overdose deaths increased 91 percent.\n\nIn briefs, lawyers for Mr. Hunter who, like many government officials bringing such cases, is using outside counsel, have called J & J the \"kingpin behind the public-health emergency.\"\n\nOne of Mr. Hunter's lead lawyers lost a niece to opioids; another, a son.\n\nOklahoma's case against J & J largely falls into three areas. The first is the company's marketing and sales practices, including targeting populations like veterans and children, and using patient front groups and high-profile doctors who oversold the benefits and downplayed the risks of the drugs. By doing so, the state says, the company helped normalize opioids from what had originally been a very conservative approach to them.\n\nThe second is J & J's former ownership of two companies that produced and refined Tasmanian poppies into narcotics material for other drug manufacturers, including Purdue. Finally, the state points to the company's development and sales of its own opioids.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nJ & J says the company manufactured drugs that played only a minor role in the market, even as it was conducting business that was heavily regulated and approved by government agencies.\n\nThe company stopped marketing Duragesic by 2008, court papers said, and divested Nucynta in 2015, the year the company ceased marketing opioid medication altogether.\n\nJ & J's Mr. Sparks said that Oklahoma \"attempts to group all manufacturers together with general and broad allegations.\"\n\nIn 2017, Oklahoma became one of the first states to file a prescription opioid lawsuit. In the ensuing months, the case has morphed considerably.\n\nOklahoma recently jettisoned most of its claims to concentrate on just one -- that the companies violated the state's public nuisance law, creating a substantial health harm.\n\nUnlike a conventional lawsuit that seeks compensation for damages already incurred, the state is asking J & J to pay to \"abate\" the nuisance it is accused of creating, going forward.\n\nPublic nuisance laws, which are centuries old, were invoked when something interfered with a right common to the general public, traditionally roads, waterways or public spaces. Recently, their use has been expanding, with mixed results: success for the Big Tobacco settlement and some pollution cases; failure in gun litigation and most lead paint cases.\n\nMs. Burch said some courts have found that those manufacturers didn't have a specific duty to the public. The companies had prevailed by arguing that once the product left their facilities, they were not the direct cause of the ensuing harm or in a position to remedy it.\n\nSimilarly, she said, opioid defendants contend that the connection between manufacturers and overdose deaths is too attenuated.\n\nEarlier this month, a North Dakota judge dismissed that state's case against Purdue, including its public nuisance claim. While the ruling affects only that state, lawyers have said the decision creates an appellate template for defendants. Public nuisance laws, the judge wrote, were not intended where \"one party has sold to another a product that later is alleged to constitute a nuisance.\"\n\nMr. Hunter says that Oklahoma's own law is \"powerful and expansive.\"\n\nThe state had been eager for a jury trial. But recently, lawyers reversed course and requested a bench trial, despite the perception that a jury could be readily convinced to seek revenge for the opioid devastation.\n\nThat perception is not necessarily true. \"Juries are increasingly pro-defendant,\" said Ms. Lahav. \"And the state may feel that Oklahomans are business-friendly and individualistic.\"\n\nJurors might have responded well to the company's argument that manufacturers were producing medicines that were government-approved, she added, and that people had a choice about whether or not to take them.\n\nIt was J & J who wound up requesting a jury trial. That was likely because, said Adam Zimmerman, who teaches complex litigation at Loyola Law School Los Angeles, Judge Balkman has made rulings against the defense and has steadily marched the parties toward a trial date.\n\n\"J & J would probably rather try their luck with 12 people as opposed to this one person,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement about the Teva settlement, Mr. Hunter said: \"Nearly all Oklahomans have been negatively impacted by this deadly crisis and we look forward to Tuesday, where we will prove our case against Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jan_hoffman@nytimes.com", "name": "Jan Hoffman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/26/science/26OPIOIDS-OKLAHOMA1/26OPIOIDS-OKLAHOMA1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4813972", "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 296584380}, {"uri": "1145506561", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-25", "time": "21:48:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-25T21:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-newly-released-deposition-oxycontin-owner-defends-response-to-reports-of-abuse-11558818922", "title": "In Newly Released Deposition, OxyContin Owner Defends Response to Reports of Abuse", "body": "March inquiry offers rare view of Richard Sackler's views on the opioid epidemic amid litigation By Sara Randazzo Sara Randazzo The Wall Street Journal BiographySara Randazzo @sara_randazzo sara.randazzo@wsj.com May 25, 2019 5:15 p.m. ET\n\nRichard Sackler, an owner of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, received an email from a friend in 2002 detailing what the friend called some \"items of interest.\"\n\nThe friend, an anesthesiologist, mentioned that his local pharmacy had spent $12,000 on remodeling to increase security because of OxyContin, the powerful opioid painkiller. The friend recounted that he had recently spoken to a student at an exclusive private high school who said someone had tried to sell her the \"designer drug\" OxyContin in the campus halls.\n\n\"I hate to say this, but you could become the Pablo Escobar of the new millennium,\" the friend wrote, referring to the Colombian drug lord.\n\nThe email is included in a deposition of Dr. Sackler taken this year as part of litigation brought by states and local municipalities seeking to hold Purdue accountable for the opioid crisis. Parts of the 460-page document, recently made public and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, have been redacted.\n\nDr. Sackler, the 74-year-old son of one of three brothers who founded the company, hasn't spoken publicly as lawsuits have piled up against Purdue and as cultural institutions have shunned involvement with the philanthropic family. Purdue and family members, including Dr. Sackler, named in the lawsuits dispute that they are to blame for the broader opioid crisis and are fighting the claims.\n\nThe March deposition offers a rare window into Dr. Sackler's current views on the opioid epidemic and the line he draws between what he calls real patients and addicts. It shows an aging Dr. Sackler at times forgetful: There were dozens of instances in which he said he didn't recall the answer to a question. At other times, he was exacting in his defense of Purdue.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nPurdue Pharma Hit With Fresh Round of Opioid Lawsuits (May 16) The Met Stops Taking Gifts From Sackler Family (May 15) Opioid Makers Draw Scrutiny From Hedge Funds (May 15)\n\nDr. Sackler and Purdue on Saturday said in statements the deposition shows the company responded to evidence of widespread abuse and diversion. That included working with public-health authorities, enacting more than 65 initiatives and spending $1.5 billion to abate the problem.\n\nPlaintiffs attorneys Linda Singer and Paul Hanly questioned Dr. Sackler for hours over two days in early March, seeking to pin down when he learned OxyContin was being abused and what, if anything, he did to try to stop it.\n\nAsked if the 2002 email from his friend, coming six years after OxyContin's launch, made him think he should change anything, Dr. Sackler responded that, while a single incident could serve as an alert, \"I was trained not to chase what could be random events.\" He said he believes Purdue at the time was helping pharmacies improve their security and had programs in place in high schools, but he said \"my recollection is vague.\"\n\nAfter presenting Dr. Sackler with emails showing he often asked Purdue staff for sales data, Ms. Singer asked if he ever requested data on OxyContin abuse or overdose rates. \"I don't recall that,\" he said.\n\nThroughout the deposition, Dr. Sackler said the company had programs in place to respond to reports of abuse. Saturday's statement from Dr. Sackler's lawyer said the initiatives included supporting a prescription-drug monitoring program and partnering with groups on substance-abuse education.\n\nA trained physician, Dr. Sackler served as Purdue's president from 1999 to 2003 and remained on the board until last year.\n\nIn May 2000, Purdue executive Michael Friedman sent an email describing a cluster of reports from Ohio about a man robbing pharmacies for OxyContin.\n\n\"I hate this,\" Dr. Sackler responded. \"This will feed on itself. Doesn't this guy rob Dilaudid and other opioids?\" Asked about that email in March, Dr. Sackler said what he meant was, \"I hate the abuse, even though it was recognized by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] to be a risk and called out in the package insert.\"\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nAttorneys presented to him an earlier example of when he was told about potential problems, a 1999 email describing an online message board where addicts talked about ways to abuse OxyContin. Ms. Singer asked if he was aware sales representatives used the words \"street value,\" \"crush\" or \"snort\" more than 100 times in sales calls from 1997 to 1999. \"I don't think I was aware of it,\" he said. \"No, I'm quite sure I wasn't.\"\n\nMr. Friedman was one of three executives who pleaded guilty in 2007, along with the company, to criminal charges of misleading the public about OxyContin's addiction risks. The company and the executives paid a collective $634.5 million in penalties and costs.\n\nThree years after the guilty plea, Purdue introduced a tamper-resistant formulation of OxyContin, which Mr. Sackler said in the deposition cost about a billion dollars to develop.\n\nDuring the interview, Dr. Sackler told attorneys that his memory had become spotty after three strokes he suffered several years ago and that he had anemia because of internal bleeding. He mentioned he had poor hearing and several times during questioning said it was time to change the batteries on his hearing aids.\n\nThe deposition is being used by attorneys pressing some 1,700 cases on behalf of cities, counties and Native American tribes that have been consolidated in federal court in Cleveland. It is also being used by state attorneys general separately pursuing actions.\n\nAbout 400,000 people in the U.S. died between 1999 to 2017 from prescription and illegal opioids, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe two branches of the Sackler family that own Purdue Pharma have made billions of dollars in profits from the company, earlier court filings show. In 2015, Forbes estimated the family was worth $14 billion. Asked about the figure, Dr. Sackler said in the deposition that the Forbes number \"is likely to be considerably higher\" than the family's value today.\n\nDr. Sackler at one point disputed a suggestion that he had contempt for addicts, explaining his view is that \"they often become addicted because they're in miserable circumstances.\" He said: \"I feel bad that there are lots of miserable and or depressed people.\"\n\nWrite to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com", "source": {"uri": "wsj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-77241/social", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": null, "wgt": 296516880}, {"uri": "1145324006", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-25", "time": "14:42:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-25T14:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/california-assembly-approves-supervised-opioid-injection-facility-faces-federal-opposition/2019/05/25/ca9910c6-7e4c-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html", "title": "California Assembly approves supervised opioid injection facility, faces federal opposition", "body": "By Katie Zezima Katie Zezima National reporter covering vice May 25 at 8:17 AM\n\nThe California Assembly has passed a bill allowing San Francisco to open a facility where people can use illegal drugs under supervision, one of several local efforts nationwide to curb overdose deaths that has drawn opposition from the federal government.\n\nThe bill's passage comes months after the Department of Justice sued to block a Philadelphia nonprofit organization from opening what is known as a supervised injection facility. Such sites allow people to use illicit drugs, but they also allow medical professionals to closely monitor users and help them immediately in the case of overdoses.\n\nOfficials in San Francisco believe opening such a facility is necessary to help alleviate the city's chronic drug and homelessness problem, which has led to open-air drug use and needles and other drug paraphernalia being strewn on city streets. Mayor London Breed (D) has pushed for the facility to go forward.\n\n\"She's been clear that we have a crisis, an injection crisis, on our streets,\" said Jeff Cretan, a spokesman for Breed. \"A safe injection site will obviously help not only reduce the needles that are on our sidewalks .\u2009.\u2009. just as importantly it will provide a space where people can go when they are ready to seek treatment.\"\n\n[Obama officials failed to focus as fentanyl burned its way across America]\n\nSan Francisco is one of several cities that have vowed to open a supervised injection site despite the federal government saying they are illegal. Mayor Libby Schaaf (D) of neighboring Oakland introduced a resolution to the city council earlier this month asking that the bill paving the way for San Francisco's site also include Oakland.\n\nCity officials in Ithaca, N.Y., Denver, Seattle and New York have expressed interest in opening safe injection facilities, as has a legislative committee in Massachusetts.\n\nThe municipalities argue that the facilities would help alleviate the nation's opioid epidemic, which killed more than 47,000 people in 2017. Most of the deaths have been driven by fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid.\n\nThe Trump administration argued in the Philadelphia case that opening such a facility would violate federal law under a statute used to prosecute crack houses. Government lawyers say that allowing the use of illegal drugs would exacerbate the nation's opioid epidemic.\n\nBut officials in California say they are not cowed.\n\nThe bill passed in a 44 to 26 vote, and it now heads to the state senate, where proponents said they are cautiously optimistic that the bill will pass. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has indicated that he would sign a bill allowing such facilities to open. His office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n[Trump called the opioid epidemic a priority, but fentanyl deaths soar as resources fail to keep pace]\n\n\"California legislators tend not to be intimated by the Trump Administration,\" said state Sen. Scott Weiner (D). \"I don't view that as resonating in the California leiglsature.\"\n\nA similar measure cleared the legislature last year, but was it was vetoed by Gov. Jerry Brown (D).\n\nSan Francisco would be a pilot site for the state -- officials would gather information and data about how the supervised injection facility functions and whether it can be replicated elsewhere. Weiner said the facilities are necessary because they shift the focus on addiction away from punishment and toward helping drug abusers.\n\n\"It's a health issue, not a criminal issue, and we need to take approaches that are science-based, not fear-based, and we know from experience around the world that safe injection sites work,\" he said.\n\nSupervised injection facilities operate in Australia, Canada and Europe. Officials from U.S. cities have visited a large supervised consumption facility in Vancouver, and a smaller one in Toronto.\n\nA Philadelphia delegation led by former city mayor and Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell (D) was among them. Rendell has been a vocal supporter of the city's facility, called Safehouse. The group has claimed that the facility would be consistent with existing law because it would provide access to medical treatment and overdose services, which are not prohibited by federal statute.\n\nSafehouse also claims that preventing the facility from opening would violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, prohibiting people from exercising their religious belief in treating members of a vulnerable population.\n\nPhiladelphia is home to one of the nation's largest open-air drug markets, where heroin laced with fentanyl, or pure fentanyl, are rampant.

Assistant editor and Opinions contributor May 24 at 3:22 PM\n\n\"We have to start talking about solutions,\" Kellyanne Conway, ostensibly the White House opioids policy coordinator, said this week.\n\nStart? Really?\n\nWe can't blame our opioid crisis on President Trump. The epidemic pre-dates not only his administration but his entire jaunt into Republican politics.\n\nBut it took Trump nine months to even mention fentanyl publicly as president, The Post reported this week. His administration has ramped up law enforcement action against the drug, but to the dismay of Trump's own advisers on the issue, he has neglected any action on prevention or treatment. Trump also sidelined the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy -- which is responsible for coordinating federal drug policy -- and left it leaderless until early this year. He also waited until late 2017 to declare a largely toothless \"public health emergency.\" A year later, he and his Republican cohort in Congress signed into law a bipartisan package that almost everyone supported, but few believed would significantly address the crisis. The legislation added at most $8 billion in new funding over five years -- far less than recommended by Trump's own commission on the crisis.\n\nThe response to these facts? \"It can't all be gloom and doom,\" said Conway. \"You can't just have the negative, harrowing, so-sad statistics of grief and loss and devastation. We have to start talking about solutions.\"\n\nTrump came into office at the exact time that leadership was so desperately needed. Yet he and his fellow Republicans have not only failed to take the lead, they have pretended to make the crisis a priority while offering only perfunctory policy solutions. If we take one lesson from the first three years of the president's drug policies, it is this: Trump owns the fentanyl crisis.\n\nAs The Post's report makes clear, Trump was well aware of the epidemic even before his administration began. He campaigned on addressing the opioid crisis, specifically mentioning fentanyl -- the potent synthetic opioid responsible for the most recent surge in overdose deaths in the United States -- some 57 times during his speeches and appearances.\n\nBut, of course, Trump tried to paint the drug as an issue of border security, suggesting that building a wall along the southern border would stop the problem. Most of the pure fentanyl arriving in the United States, however, comes from China. In other words, Trump used the issue as a political prop with no intention of addressing its real causes once in office.\n\nWe know what is needed to address this crisis, but the problem is that Republicans and the Trump administration have resisted it from day one.\n\nFirst and foremost, we need to expand access to medication-assisted treatment. This would require a massive overhaul of the distribution system for addiction-therapy drugs such as buprenorphine (designed to reduce cravings for opioids) to make it easier for doctors to prescribe them and for patients to afford them. We would also need to expand access to health care for low-income Americans. That would involve encouraging states to expand Medicaid -- not attempting to repeal the Affordable Care Act via lawsuit or adding burdensome work requirements to the program.\n\nIn other words, we need a massive investment from the government -- tens of billions of dollars each year. Without it, all we will have is more \"gloom and doom.\"\n\nOverdoses have leveled off of late, but synthetic opioid overdoses remains so prevalent, that in areas where the epidemic has hit hardest, people almost yearn for the days when heroin was the primary drug ravaging their communities. Fentanyl has also begun to infect the supply of cocaine and methamphetamines, leading to massive spikes in overdoses among other drug users.\n\nTo be clear, President Barack Obama's administration ignored the pleas from the health-care community as the fentanyl crisis was starting to balloon. But Trump's inaction is not excused by his predecessor's failures. (And Obama did enact one of the largest expansions of health care for low-income Americans in history.)\n\nMore than two years into Trump's administration, Trump has reneged on his promise to fight for the forgotten men and women of the opioid crisis. As the body count rises ahead of the 2020 election, we'll see whether he'll have to answer for his failures, or whether his base will let him off the hook on the crisis, too.\n\nJosh Rogin: The U.S. shouldn't take China at its word on fentanyl\n\nThe Post's View: China promised to ban a range of opioids.

The RICO conspiracy provision allowed prosecutors to establish that Insys engaged in a long-term plan to distribute Subsys, a fentanyl-based pain reliever that is highly addictive, by bribing doctors and misleading insurers about the needs of patients who were not supposed to receive the drug.\n\nThe trial lasted 10 weeks, and the jury deliberated for 15 days, which shows how complicated a RICO conspiracy case can be for prosecutors. Mr. Kapoor's attorney said the length of the deliberations confirmed \"that this was far from an open-and-shut case.\"\n\nThe next issue will be how much prison time to impose on the defendants. By obtaining convictions under the federal racketeering law, the Justice Department is likely to seek a more significant prison term than typical for corporate misconduct.\n\nTo prove a RICO conspiracy, prosecutors must show an agreement to violate other federal laws through what is called a pattern of racketeering activity. The indictment in the Insys case referred to the drug distribution statute as one of the predicate acts for the RICO violation, which may enable the Justice Department to seek a significant prison term for Mr. Kapoor.\n\nThe maximum penalty authorized for a RICO violation is 20 years. Under the federal sentencing guidelines, a defendant convicted of a RICO conspiracy will be sentenced based on the underlying criminal violations. For a drug offense, the amount of Subsys improperly prescribed will be a key determinant of the recommended sentence.\n\nFor example, if the amount of drugs illegally distributed was more than 36 kilograms, the recommended sentence could be as long as 235 months in a federal prison, which would be just under the 20-year punishment cap in RICO. If the government proves that only a smaller amount of drugs were improperly distributed, that would most likely result in a recommended sentence of at least 10 years.\n\nInsys also received significant income from its sales of Subsys, so if prosecutors focus on the company's profits from the illegal conduct, the recommended sentence could be as much as 15 years in prison.\n\nAnother punishment that could be imposed under RICO is mandatory asset forfeitures of any gains from the illegal activity, which means bonuses and stock awards from the company for meeting sales targets. In addition, prosecutors can seek Mr. Kapoor's 47 million shares of Insys, which constitute more than a 60 percent ownership stake.\n\nThe question now is whether this RICO conspiracy prosecution will become the template for cases against corporate executives for their role in the opioid crisis.\n\nRICO cases require the government to gather evidence that there was a systematic pattern of violations, not just isolated misconduct. That means proving that an enterprise, which can be the company itself, was operated through illegal acts.\n\nThe case against Mr. Kapoor and other Insys executives involved extensive testimony about bribes paid to doctors and lies to insurers to get them to pay for the drug, which made it much easier to show a pattern of illegal conduct. But if the violations occur at a lower level in a pharmaceutical company, linking them to the top executives may be difficult.\n\nNevertheless, the successful prosecution of the Insys executives is sure to embolden the Justice Department to look at RICO.\n\nThe breadth of the law, enacted to help fight organized crime, makes it a potentially powerful tool to police the conduct of pharmaceutical firms that helped fuel the opioid crisis. The hefty penalties that can be imposed are a potent stick to get cooperation from those who participated in illegal activity.\n\nFor those reasons, it would hardly be surprising if RICO became the tool of choice for federal prosecutors looking to build a case against pharmaceutical executives.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_j_henning@nytimes.com", "name": "Peter J.

Farmers tend to be churchgoers, and in southern Ohio, they also tend to be pro-life and, perhaps even more devoutly, pro-Second Amendment. Most farmers are hunters, with multiple firearms in their arsenals. They're also big fans of Trump's border wall with Mexico.\n\nA Trump opponent in 2020 who is pro-choice, in favor of curtailing gun rights and opposed to the border wall (is there a serious Democratic hopeful who doesn't check all those boxes?) cannot expect to make much of a dent in rural America, trade war or not.\n\nBut while most southern Ohio farmers are not deserting Trump, there are some who are ignoring his rhetoric on energy. Even as Trump belittles renewable power sources such as windmills -- \"When the wind doesn't blow, just turn off the television darling, please,\" is a favorite Trump jab -- nearly 5,000 acres of farmland here in Highland County could soon be converted from traditional corn and soybeans to shiny new solar panels.\n\nTwo projects expected to consist of a total of 1.5 million solar modules -- creating the largest solar farm in Ohio -- are rapidly working their way through state regulatory agencies. If they gain final approval, which seems likely, construction could start later this year. The combined 450-megawatt projects would be operational by 2021.\n\nCompany officials say Highland County (where I serve on the board of commissioners, which approves the county budget) was chosen because studies show a high rate of optimum sunshine in the region. Local skeptics pointed out that almost no zoning restrictions in the county were a more likely draw. In any case, for farm families here and elsewhere in Ohio -- who are currently rushing to plant crops during a particularly wet spring -- the real impetus for turning cropland into solar arrays is simple economics.\n\nSmall family farms have been on the decline for decades. In his 2012 book, \"A Family Farm: Life on an Illinois Dairy Farm,\" author Robert Switzer noted, \"In 1900, 42 percent of the U.S. population lived on farms; by 1990 that number had dwindled to less than 2 percent.\" The trend has continued thanks to rising costs and growing debt, coupled with decades of stagnant crop prices and the move toward mass production on corporate mega farms. Plus, fewer sons and daughters are interested in continuing the family tradition, making the lure of per-acre prices well above market value offered by solar companies too tempting to turn down.\n\nAt recent public hearings I attended, some among the roughly 30 landowners who are selling or leasing their land for the projects extolled the benefits of solar, but most offered the frank explanation that the deals they were offered were a financial lifeline not only for them, but for their children and grandchildren.\n\nAmong those opposed to the projects were neighboring farmers who are worried about lower property values, soil contamination issues and the loss of the region's farming tradition. Plus, some said, they simply don't want to wake up every day to the sight of thousands of solar modules in fields side by side with their crops.\n\nThe testimony was sometimes heart-wrenching. Some members of multigenerational farm families who have made deals with the solar companies spoke with tears in their eyes. Farming is in their blood, and in a perfect world they would continue the family tradition. But for them, it's been a long time since the world was perfect.\n\nLots of promises are being made by solar enthusiasts about jobs, infrastructure improvements and other benefits for this western corner of Appalachian Ohio. One handout from a solar advocacy group even suggested that such developments can help fight Ohio's opioid epidemic.\n\nBut tipping the scale for most county residents is the promise of more dollars in local communities, particularly for education. Ohio's school funding formula is largely based on local real estate taxes, leading to richer districts in the suburbs and poorer districts in many rural areas. Thanks to Ohio's \"payment in lieu of taxes\" formula for renewable energy projects, solar companies will pay several thousand dollars per megawatt, adding up to millions in additional revenue in the coming years. A couple of small school districts where the projects are located will be the biggest beneficiaries here.\n\nThe president may ridicule wind and solar, but in the heart of Trump Country, renewable energy is about to flourish, providing electricity for thousands of customers -- but only after turning off the lights in a few old barns.\n\nDavid Von Drehle: The energy revolution has already begun\n\nDavid Ignatius: America's bright energy future\n\nThe Post's View: Dear Congress: Burning wood is not the future of energy\n\nThe Post's View: See it, say it: Climate change\n\nRobert J.

Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said to Hadley near the beginning of the two-hour hearing.\n\nConservative health policy wonk Chris Jacobs:\n\nIt was the second House hearing this year regarding a single-payer health-care system, a direction many Democrats on the presidential campaign trail and in Congress want to move as a way of closing the country's persistent uninsured gap and guaranteeing Americans a full range of benefits.\n\nTheir movement toward Medicare-for-all has engendered pushback from many corners, not just from congressional Republicans, but also from industry leaders and top officials in the Trump administration. Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has been particularly vocal in her opposition to the idea -- and yesterday reiterated her views to reporters.\n\n\"I'm the head of the Medicare program ... When I see policies that I think could harm the program and harm its beneficiaries, then I think it is my duty to speak out about that and inform the public about that,\" Verma said, per my Washington Post colleague Amy Goldstein.\n\nVerma pointed as an example to the innovative CAR T-cell cancer therapy, saying Medicare's difficulties in deciding how much to pay for the expensive new treatment show the challenges presented by a system in which the government would pay for everyone's treatment.\n\n\"I'm sitting every day in this chair unraveling problems in the Medicare program, dealing with bureaucracy and regulation that actually thwart innovation,\" Verma said. \"It's important for the American public to understand the implications of a government-run program.\"\n\nVerma is at least right about this: There are lots of implications of Medicare-for-all that lawmakers would need to wrestle with. That was the ultimate message from Hadley and his colleagues to Budget Committee members.\n\n\"Moving to a single-payer system would be a major undertaking,\" Hadley told the committee. \"It would involve significant changes for all participants ... lawmakers would need to make many decisions with complex trade-offs.\"\n\nHis sober testimony mirrored a report the CBO issued earlier this month on single-payer systems, which detailed the huge range of considerations lawmakers would face -- such as how generous the benefits would be, how much doctors and hospitals would be paid, and how to structure taxes to pay for the whole thing.\n\nLarry Levitt, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation:\n\nYet a Medicare-for-all hearing would hardly be complete without some fiery exchanges, as Republicans sought to portray the program as disastrous for U.S. health care and Democrats passionately defended their goals of more-generous health coverage for everyone.\n\n\"Out-of-control health-care costs are impacting families who have employer coverage,\" said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.). \"Americans have so much skin in the game they're getting third-degree burns.\"\n\nHadley kept his cool as legislators tried to corner him into affirming their own positions. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.) said Democrats \"believe in the magic health-care fairy\" and that there would be unlimited funding and no rationing in a Medicare-for-all system.\n\n\"Mr. Hadley, may I ask you a question? Where in the Constitution is the phrase 'dental plan' found?\" Roy said.\n\n\"It's not,\" Hadley replied.\n\n\"How about prescription drugs? Standard of care? Co-pay?\" Roy asked. \"No,\" Hadley responded.\n\n\"Right,\" Roy said.\n\nIn another exchange, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) plied Hadley on whether Medicare-for-all is socialism, as Republicans are fond of claiming.\n\n\"We haven't drawn a conclusion about socialism,\" Hadley responded.\n\nKhanna kept at it. \"Do you think anyone would pass Economics 101 with if they gave that answer in any major university in this country? MIT, University of Chicago?\" he said.\n\nHadley responded that the CBO \"doesn't have its own definition of socialism.\"\n\n-- In pockets across the country, people are continuing to die in record numbers after overdosing on the potent opioid fentanyl, and resources for treatment are not arriving fast enough.\n\n\"President Trump has taken a number of steps to confront the crisis, stem the flow of fentanyl into the country from China and Mexico, and step up prosecutions of traffickers. Congress also has increased spending on drug treatment,\" our Post colleagues Sari Horwitz, Scott Higham, Steven Rich and Shelby Hanssen write in this latest investigation in a series about the nation's deadliest drug crisis.\n\n\"But health policy experts say drug treatment funding is not nearly enough, and the administration's response was hobbled by the failure to appoint a drug czar in its chaotic first year and confusion over who was in charge of drug policy,\" they write. The depth of the problem continues to overwhelm the government's response, and the administration has yet to produce a comprehensive strategy that is legally required by Congress.\"\n\nJoshua M. Sharfstein, vice dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the \"scale of death here is really unprecedented.\" During the first year of the Trump administration, a record 28,869 people died of synthetic-opioid-related overdoses, and most from fentanyl. It was a 46.4 percent increase from 2016. Data for the first eight months of 2018 suggest the death rate is on pace to exceed the year before.\n\nThe president declared the opioid crisis to be a public health emergency in October 2017. But two things were missing: funding and a plan to address the crisis, our colleagues write.\n\n\"When you say this is an emergency, you would expect to hear what they plan to do about the emergency,\" said Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University.\n\n-- Two members of Congress released a report alleging the World Health Organization's guidelines on pain treatment were directly influenced by the pharmaceutical industry. The congressional report from the offices of Reps. Katherine M. Clark (D-Mass.) and Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) claims further that guidelines for prescribing powerful painkillers seem to mimic marketing from opioid maker Purdue Pharma.\n\n\"The web of influence we uncovered, combined with the WHO's recommendations, paints a picture of a public health organization that has been manipulated by the opioid industry,\" the report reads.\n\n\"The report alleges that two WHO reports that provide guidelines for treating severe pain -- one in adults and the other in children -- draw directly from Purdue's strategies on how to market opioids,\" our Post colleague Katie Zezima reports. \"The report cites Purdue's 1996 budget plans, which were posted online by Kaiser Health News... The report claims that both Purdue and the WHO played down the risk of addiction, with the global health organization saying there was an 'unreasonable fear' of opioids.\"\n\nFor its part, Purdue \"strongly denies the claims\" in the report. WHO did not respond to a Post request for comment.\n\nAHH: Members of Rep. Dan Lipinski's own party are distancing themselves from the incumbent because of his antiabortion stance with renewed attention to abortion rights in the wake of new state laws in Alabama and Missouri. Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), the chairwoman of the House Democrats' campaign arm, withdrew from a fundraiser for Lipinski, one of the last Democrats in Congress to oppose abortion rights.\n\nLipinski is facing a primary challenge from the left, as our Post colleague Colby Itkowtiz reports, and Bustos was set to appear at a reelection event.\n\n\"Normally, a top Democrat appearing at one of his fundraisers would be little noticed, but abortion issues are incredibly fraught as some conservative states move to outlaw abortion in an effort to overturn Roe v. Wade,\" Colby writes.\n\n\"I'm proud to have a 100 percent pro-choice voting record and I'm deeply alarmed by the rapidly escalating attacks on women's access to reproductive care in several states,\" Bustos said in a statement.\n\nOOF: The Department of Health and Human Services acknowledged that a 10-year-old migrant girl from El Salvador died while in federal custody in September, CBS News's Graham Kates and Angel Canales report. She was the first of six migrant children to die in the past eight months while in U.S. custody or soon after being released.\n\nHHS spokesman Mark Weber said in a statement the child had a history of congenital heart defects, and she was in a \"medically fragile\" condition when she came into the care of the agency's Office of Refugee Resettlement in March 2018.\n\n\"Following a surgical procedure, complications left the child in a comatose state. She was transported to a nursing facility in Phoenix, Arizona for palliative care in May after release from a San Antonio hospital,\" Weber said. \"On September 26, she was transferred to an Omaha, Neb., nursing facility to be closer to her family. On September 29, the child was transported to Children's Hospital of Omaha where she passed due to fever and respiratory distress.\"\n\nThe news of the girl's death came the same week a 16-year-old migrant boy died at a Border Patrol facility in Weslaco, Tex. The boy was the fifth Guatemalan child to die since December after being apprehended by Border Patrol agents.\n\nOUCH: A day after the 16-year-old boy in federal custody died after being diagnosed with the flu, a migrant detention center in McAllen, Tex., was put under quarantine after a \"large number\" of migrants were found to be suffering flulike symptoms.\n\nIt's not clear how many individuals are ill, our Post colleague Meagan Flynn reports. She adds the outbreak \"comes amid severe overcrowding problems at migrant detention facilities in South Texas and heightened scrutiny of the conditions within them, as five child migrants have died in U.S. custody since December. The ballooning numbers of people crossing the southern border to claim asylum has overwhelmed the immigration system, from border stations to the courts, and led CBP to take drastic measures.\"\n\n\"To avoid the spread of illness, the Rio Grande Valley Sector has temporarily suspended intake operations at the [Central Processing Center],\" U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement. \"Individuals apprehended in RGV Sector will be held at other locations until this situation is resolved.\"\n\nThe latest migrant death has also raised questions about whether medical screenings conducted by CBP and treatments are adequate for the volume of people they're seeing in these facilities.\n\n-- Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) will today release a joint bipartisan discussion draft focused on lowering health-care costs. According to aides, the draft will include five parts focused on ending surprise medical bills, reducing the prices of prescription drugs, improving transparency care, improving public health and improving the exchange of health IT.\n\nIt may contain as many as two dozen separate proposals, Alexander told reporters earlier this week. He plans to hold a markup of the proposals this summer in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which he chairs.\n\n-- Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is proposing a Family Bill of Rights that would expand access to adoption and medical care and would also require insurance companies to cover costly fertility treatments. She pledged to implement the plan within 100 days of taking offices if she is elected as president.\n\nIn a post on Medium, Gillibrand says her Family Bill of Rights \"guarantees a set of fundamental rights to give every child the chance to succeed\u200a -- \u200ano matter what block they grow up on.\"\n\nThe plan looks to tackle, among other things, the issue of access to OB-GYNs in rural areas. The plan will also \"provide a tax credit to ensure that a family's ability to adopt and provide a stable home for a child isn't dependent on their wealth.\"\n\n-- Sen.

Many of them are withdrawing from fentanyl.\n\nThe jail, built in 1884 to hold 24, now houses 55 men and women, a number that can swell to as many as 90. The inmates are sprawled on metal bunk beds and mattresses that line the floors as they wait for court appearances or serve time on low-level drug offenses.\n\nThe medical exam room, used to treat minor ailments, is tucked into a broom closet beneath a concrete stairwell. With few drug treatment options, prisoners strung out on fentanyl go through days of withdrawal with little help, shivering and curled up on the beds and floors of the jail.\n\n\"It's definitely our detox center right now. They just sit there, and they withdraw there,\" Fayette County Deputy Health Commissioner Leigh N. Cannon said. \"Treatment is where we need help. We keep hearing that money is coming, but we haven't really seen it.\"\n\nThe inmates here are at least alive -- unlike so many drug users in this part of central Ohio, 40 miles southwest of Columbus. Fayette County has the seventh-highest number of fentanyl overdose deaths per capita in the nation, according to internal data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention obtained and analyzed by The Washington Post.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has made the opioid epidemic a priority, people in communities across the country continue to die in record numbers from fentanyl, and health officials are struggling to provide treatment for tens of thousands more, like the men and women warehoused inside this jail.\n\nPresident Trump has taken a number of steps to confront the crisis, stem the flow of fentanyl into the country from China and Mexico, and step up prosecutions of traffickers. Congress also has increased spending on drug treatment.\n\n\"Everyone here today is united by the same vital goal -- to liberate our fellow Americans from the grip of drug addiction and to end the opioid crisis once and for all,\" Trump said at a drug abuse summit in Atlanta on April 24. \"It's happening. It's happening.\"\n\nBut health policy experts say drug treatment funding is not nearly enough, and the administration's response was hobbled by the failure to appoint a drug czar in its chaotic first year and confusion over who was in charge of drug policy. The depth of the problem continues to overwhelm the government's response, and the administration has yet to produce a comprehensive strategy that is legally required by Congress.\n\nJohn P. Walters, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy during the George W. Bush administration, said that after two years and a presidential commission to study the problem, the Trump administration is still struggling to confront the deadliest drug crisis in U.S. history and is not dedicating nearly enough federal resources.\n\n\"What other threat that is preventable is going to kill tens of thousands of Americans?\" Walters said. \"We're spending much more money on terrorism, as we should, but we're not spending a similar amount on the source of death to many more Americans right now.\"\n\n[Have you lost a family member or loved one to a fentanyl-related overdose? Tell us about them.]\n\nIn 2017, the first year of the Trump presidency, a record 28,869 people died from synthetic-opioid-related overdoses, a 46.4 percent increase from the year before. Most were from fentanyl, which is 50 times more powerful than heroin. Estimates for the first eight months of 2018, the most recent available, show that an additional 20,537 Americans died -- a toll on pace to exceed the previous year's.\n\n\"The scale of death here is really unprecedented, and so you have to judge the response against the scale of the problem,\" said Joshua M. Sharfstein, vice dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"You can have some progress, but it's really insufficient if you are not up to the scale of the problem.\"\n\nSharfstein and other public health experts also note that the administration is seeking to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut $1.5 trillion over 10 years from Medicaid. More than 500,000 people addicted to opioids could lose their drug treatment coverage if the ACA is repealed, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The proposed Medicaid cuts could further reduce coverage.\n\nTrump officials said they are making progress against the epidemic on a range of fronts, including interdiction, prosecution and treatment, but they acknowledge that it remains a huge challenge.\n\n\"We didn't get into this crisis overnight. We're not going to get out overnight,\" Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president and the administration's leading voice on the epidemic, said in an interview.\n\nConway said Trump views his handling of the crisis as a \"legacy issue\" and continually asks her for updates about what is taking place in the states.\n\n\"It can't all be gloom and doom. You can't just have the negative, harrowing, so-sad statistics of grief and loss and devastation. We have to start talking about solutions,\" she said. \"The battleship is starting to turn in the other direction.\"\n\nThe CDC data obtained by The Post documents for the first time the 10 places with the highest per capita fentanyl-related overdose death rates: five counties in Ohio, two in West Virginia and one in Kentucky and the cities of Baltimore and St. Louis. Local health officials told The Post they are still not receiving enough federal money to fund drug treatment programs to wean people off highly addictive opioids or launch prevention programs to warn people of the dangers of fentanyl.\n\nIn Cabell County, W.Va., the county with the highest fentanyl overdose death rate in the nation, there are long waiting lists for treatment.\n\n\"When somebody is saying, 'I'm ready for treatment' and they want help, they shouldn't have to wait six months, six weeks or six days,\" said Steve Williams, mayor of Huntington, the county seat of Cabell. \"They should be able to get in a treatment program within six hours.\"\n\nIn Ohio, deaths from fentanyl have ravaged vast sections of the state. In 2015, there were 1,255 synthetic-opioid-related deaths, most from fentanyl. By the end of 2017, that number had nearly tripled to 3,572.\n\nIn rural counties of Ohio, federal money recently appropriated by Congress has started to arrive, but health officials there say it is not enough.\n\n\"The situation four years ago was looking desperate. Today, it's looking dire,\" said Scott Gehring, president of the Community Health Alliance, a drug treatment facility in Butler County, Ohio, which has the ninth-highest fentanyl overdose death rate in the nation. \"People are sicker. More people are dying.\"\n\n'Let's do it'\n\nBetween January and April 2017, 9,370 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Elizabeth Loranzo, 25, a mother and beautician from Middletown, Pa., was one of them.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, Trump promised to halt the flow of heroin into the United States. He mentioned that drug, not fentanyl, at least 57 times during his speeches and appearances, and he tied the crisis to the need to build a wall along the border with Mexico. On the campaign trail, Trump was moved by the people he met who had lost family members to the epidemic, Conway said. As he left one stop, someone called out: \"Please follow through on the drugs and opioids. You promised.\"\n\nTrump also said addiction was a deeply personal issue for him. His older brother, Fred Jr., who suffered from alcoholism, died in 1981 at age 43.\n\nOn March 29, 2017, two months after his inauguration, Trump invited then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to the White House.\n\nChristie had told Trump that his administration was inheriting an out-of-control opioid epidemic that blew up with the arrival of fentanyl during the Obama administration -- between 2013 and 2017, more than 67,000 people died from the synthetic drug.\n\nThe opioid epidemic had begun in the late 1990s when a generation of Americans became addicted to prescription pain pills. After the government started to crack down on doctors, pain clinics, and drug manufacturers and distributors in the mid-2000s, addicts turned to heroin and then fentanyl.\n\n[What you need to know about fentanyl]\n\nIn just a few years, the synthetic painkiller became the deadliest drug ever to hit U.S. streets. Manufactured in Chinese and Mexican labs, illicit fentanyl has played a significant role in reducing the overall life expectancy of Americans. It is so powerful, just a few flecks the size of grains of salt can cause acute respiratory failure and rapid death.\n\nObama administration officials were slow to address the fentanyl epidemic. The administration saw fentanyl as an add-on to the overall opioid crisis, rather than a singular danger that required a strategy of its own because it was so deadly and was coming into the country largely unimpeded through the mail. Senior White House and Justice Department officials, motivated by a desire to rectify racial inequality in sentencing, emphasized drug treatment over incarceration, and drug prosecutions fell off as fentanyl coursed through sections of the country.\n\nFayette County Sheriff Vernon P. Stanforth opens the door to the women's facility in April at the county jail, where inmates often go through withdrawal from drugs such as fentanyl. The county has the seventh-highest number of fentanyl-related overdose deaths per capita in the nation, according to CDC data. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\n(Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nBy the time Trump came into office, the dangers of fentanyl were well known. The Drug Enforcement Administration and the CDC had issued numerous warnings. The fatal overdose rate was staggering.\n\n\"I said to [Trump] that I thought there was a lack of urgency to the way President Obama's administration had dealt with this issue, and that as a result, the problem had gotten worse,\" Christie recalled in an interview. \"We needed to go after this in a really aggressive way.\"\n\nTrump signed an executive order establishing the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis.\n\nHe put the New Jersey governor in charge.\n\n\"Let's do it,\" the president told Christie that day.\n\nA dramatic moment\n\nBetween May and August 2017, an additional 9,415 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Matthew Sutton, 39, a barber from Pasadena, Md., was one of them.\n\nAt the Justice Department, Trump's first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, launched his own assault on fentanyl.\n\nFor Sessions, fentanyl could be met only by the kind of tough law-and-order tactics he deployed as a federal prosecutor in Alabama during the \"War on Drugs\" of the 1980s and 1990s. While a member of the U.S. Senate for 20 years, Sessions was one of the few lawmakers to rail against bipartisan efforts to roll back the harsh drug sentencing policies of that era.\n\nSessions promised to make fentanyl a signature issue after his first trip to New Hampshire, a state that had experienced one of the highest fentanyl-related death rates in the country. He attended a \"youth summit\" on opioids at Manchester's downtown arena with Gov. Chris Sununu (R) on March 7, 2017.\n\n\"One of the most dramatic moments for me was the first trip to New Hampshire where Governor Sununu had 8,000 high school students gathered and 50 mothers stood before them holding large pictures of their children who died from drug overdoses,\" Sessions said in an interview.\n\nOn May 12 that year, in one of his first actions, Sessions reversed what had become known as the \"Holder Memo.\" The 2013 document written by then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. directed federal prosecutors to stop pursuing low-level, nonviolent drug charges that would trigger mandatory minimum prison sentences. Over decades, U.S. drug policy had resulted in long prison terms and increased incarceration for first-time offenders, most of them young black men, and Holder wanted to reverse what he saw as a historic injustice.\n\nA deputy sheriff removes an inmate's belt at the Fayette County Jail in April. The Ohio facility, built for 24 people, now houses 55 men and women but sometimes holds as many as 90. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nSessions directed his prosecutors to give high priority to drug cases, particularly aiming at fentanyl. Those found guilty would face the most severe penalties possible, according to a memo he sent to each U.S. attorney.\n\nIn July 2017, the Justice Department shut down the largest dark-web distributor of illicit drugs. Called AlphaBay, the site allowed users to sell and buy drugs, including fentanyl. At the time of the takedown, there were 250,000 listings for illegal drugs and toxic chemicals on the site, according to the Justice Department.\n\nThat fall, the department brought its first criminal charges against Chinese nationals accused of selling fentanyl to Americans over the Internet in cases that were filed in federal courts in North Dakota and Mississippi.\n\nSessions used an emergency declaration to make all chemical variants of fentanyl, known as analogues, illegal on a temporary basis; Congress must pass legislation to make the ban permanent. Chinese and Mexican chemists and drug traffickers in the United States had been evading the law by tweaking the chemical compounds that make up fentanyl and producing products that don't fit the precise chemical formula for a banned substance.\n\nSessions also ramped up federal prosecutions of all fentanyl offenses and sent additional prosecutors to 10 areas in the country with the highest number of overdoses.\n\nChristie, however, was growing frustrated with Sessions's exclusive focus on law enforcement actions. He said he called the attorney general several times, inviting him to speak at the commission's public hearings. Instead, Sessions sent his deputy attorney general.\n\nSessions said he has long believed in prevention and treatment programs, but as the attorney general, he was responsible for focusing on drug trafficking cases.\n\n\"I didn't find him helpful at all on the issue,\" Christie said. \"He only had one tune, which was enforcement. He didn't want to talk about the other parts of the issue. I wanted him to engage on treatment, on drug courts, and he had no interest in engaging in that. So, after a while, I just stopped calling because, what was the use?\n\n\"He was a one-trick pony.\"\n\n'Reinventing the wheel'\n\nBetween September and December 2017, an additional 9,868 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Samantha Huntley, 20, a tanning salon employee from Springfield, Mo., was one of them.\n\nDuring Trump's first months in office, the administration shunted aside its White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. The office, whose director is known as the \"drug czar,\" is responsible for coordinating anti-drug efforts across 16 federal agencies and producing the National Drug Control Strategy, an annual drug policy plan mandated by Congress.\n\nFormer Trump administration officials said the White House did not trust the career staffers at the office. One former official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the president and his aides wanted to \"transcend the drug czar\" and \"raise the issue to a higher level.\"\n\nWhite House officials treated the drug czar's office as a backwater. They staffed it with political operatives who had little or no drug policy experience and installed a 24-year-old campaign worker as the deputy chief of staff. Senior staffers with years of experience were sidelined. In May 2017, the administration proposed cutting the office's budget by 95 percent.\n\nOhio's Butler County has the ninth-highest number of fentanyl-related overdose deaths per capita in the United States, according to CDC data. Four other Ohio counties are in the top 10. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nNo one was immediately nominated to become the drug czar. As the Trump presidency entered its seventh month, there was no permanent official in charge of coordinating drug policy across myriad federal agencies -- the CDC, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill were growing impatient with the administration's lack of plans to confront the opioid epidemic. On July 26, the House Oversight and Reform Committee summoned then-acting drug czar Richard Baum, who had been in his job for four months, to explain why he had not submitted a comprehensive plan to operate and fund the office.\n\n\"Any idea when it might be submitted?\" Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) asked Baum.\n\n\"I don't want to give you a timeline,\" Baum replied. \"But I can tell you this. I've studied the issue very closely.\"\n\n\"Likewise, we need a strategy,\" Connolly said. \"Any idea when a strategy will be submitted to the Congress?\"\n\n\"We're developing a strategy now,\" Baum said.\n\nThe opioid overdose death rate, by then almost entirely fueled by illicit fentanyl, continued to climb. In 2017, fentanyl for the first time became the leading cause of overdose deaths in America.\n\nOn Sept. 1, Trump nominated Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.) to be his first permanent White House drug czar. Marino, a former prosecutor, had been one of Trump's earliest and most ardent supporters in Congress.\n\nBut Marino's nomination quickly fell apart. A joint investigation by The Post and \"60 Minutes\" disclosed that Marino had close ties to the opioid industry. The investigation found that the congressman had sponsored legislation that made it harder for the DEA to penalize drug distributors and manufacturers when they failed to report suspicious orders and shipments of narcotics.\n\nOn Oct. 17, a little more than a month after his nomination, Marino withdrew, creating even more uncertainty within the drug czar's office.\n\nAmanda Busa, 27, jokes with her fiance, Jason Mitchell, at her daughter's softball game in Frankfort, Ohio, in April. She is in recovery after years of addiction, which began with pain pills and fentanyl patches. \"This disease is real,\" she says. \"People are dying.\" (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nA week later, Trump mentioned fentanyl publicly for the first time as president; he had been in office for nine months. Trump also took Christie's advice by declaring the opioid crisis to be a public health emergency -- a step Obama officials had decided not to take in May 2016, when health policy experts asked for the declaration for fentanyl.\n\n\"As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue,\" Trump said in an Oct. 26, 2017, White House speech. \"It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction. Never been this way. We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.\"\n\nBut two things were missing: money and a detailed plan.\n\n\"When you say this is an emergency, you would expect to hear what they plan to do about the emergency,\" said Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University. \"When President Trump designated the opioid crisis a public health emergency, at the very same time, he should have said, 'Here's what we're going to do about it,' and put out a detailed plan outlining what every federal agency was going to do.\"\n\nA top Trump official would later testify before Congress that the public health declaration was intended \"to bring awareness.\"\n\nOn Nov. 1, Christie's commission released its final report, with 56 recommendations on the opioid crisis. Some drug policy experts criticized the commission for taking too long and repackaging old ideas instead of crafting a new strategy.\n\n\"They spent a year reinventing the wheel on opioid policy with things we already knew,\" said Andrew Kessler, a policy consultant who specializes in behavioral health. \"It's all been recommended before.\"\n\nSome health policy experts said the report, while not groundbreaking, did provide a blueprint for the Trump administration to follow.\n\nIt called for launching an anti-opioid public relations campaign, providing more funding for drug treatment and continuing to target traffickers. The report also called for access to medicine designed to wean people off opioids and to naloxone, an expensive medication that reverses overdoses.\n\nWhitney Millay, second from right, heads into a residential recovery facility in Washington Court House, the only one for women in Fayette County, in April. She says she overdosed 10 times on fentanyl. \"It was a fine line between oblivion and death,\" Millay says. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nChristie said the commission's work was an important start.\n\n\"I think we have to understand the fact that even the steps that we take today, as aggressive as they are compared to where we were, it's still going to take time to catch up with the problem,\" Christie said. \"Fentanyl deaths going higher are completely predictable because fentanyl is so much stronger and more lethal than street heroin.\"\n\nOne of the six members of the commission, former congressman Patrick J. Kennedy (D-R.I.), a recovering addict, said he was disappointed that Trump did not do more to promote the report.\n\n\"We just never got the president to really give it the firepower and to elevate it,\" Kennedy said in an interview.\n\nHe also hoped that Trump would use the report to press Congress for significant funding to fight the opioid epidemic, comparable to the $28 billion the federal government spends each year to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States.\n\nAnother member, Bertha Madras, said she was proud of the work. While she understood the importance of getting buy-in from the federal agencies, she was frustrated by the amount of time it took. The commission had to wait several months for officials to respond to the recommendations before the report could be issued, she said\n\n\"In the meanwhile, people are dying, and that's haunted me,\" said Madras, a Harvard Medical School professor who served in the drug czar's office during the George W. Bush administration.\n\n'Keep the damn drugs out'\n\nBetween January and April 2018, an additional 10,017 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Amanda Gray, 24, a psychology student from Manhasset, N.Y., was one of them.\n\nThe White House drug czar's office was still leaderless when Christie's commission issued its report in November 2017. A few weeks later, Trump named Conway, a former Republican Party pollster, to be his point person on the opioid epidemic. A highly skilled political operative with no drug policy experience, Conway was now in charge of coordinating the government's response to the epidemic.\n\nShe was particularly drawn to the issue after seeing devastated families on the 2016 presidential campaign trail and the toll the epidemic had taken in places like Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. She also had attended the public hearings held by Christie's commission.\n\n\"There was such a sense of urgency to literally stop the bleeding and try to stem the losses that people were feeling, that we worked as hard as we could work, as assiduously and as quickly as we could to get our arms around, 'Why now, why this?'\u2009\" Conway said.\n\nThe epidemic was a key issue in important swing states. The Journal of the American Medical Association found a correlation between chronic use of prescription painkillers and regions that supported Trump. Medicare reimbursements for opioid prescriptions also documented the epidemic's disproportionate impact on areas where Trump polled well.\n\n\"Counties and states with the highest opioid use were often areas carried by the Republican candidate,\" the researchers found. \"In many areas with high rates of drug overdose, voter turnout in 2016 exceeded that in 2012, with Donald Trump overwhelmingly favored.\"\n\nAs Conway took control of the opioid issue, confusion spread within the drug czar's office and across the government, according to former staffers who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared reprisals from the administration. Staffers in the office said they would frequently field calls from other agencies and congressional offices, requesting direction on how to increase funding for treatment or how to launch anti-opioid public education campaigns. They said they had no authority to make decisions on their own, and the queries languished.\n\nConway said their criticism was unfounded.\n\n\"Some of the career people there, respectfully, should be really excited to finally have an administration who cares enough to try to break the back of the worst drug crisis in our nation's history,\" Conway said.\n\nOn March 19, 2018, Trump and Sessions traveled to Manchester, N.H., to highlight the fight against opioids. The president told the crowd gathered at Manchester Community College that Congress was working on legislation that would set aside billions to fight the epidemic. He said he planned to increase funding to develop nonaddictive painkillers. He also said he was working to shut down illegal online marketplaces to block fentanyl coming in from China.\n\nWhat he said next overshadowed his other remarks.\n\n\"Drug traffickers kill so many thousands of our citizens every year,\" Trump said. \"And that's why my Department of Justice will be seeking so many much tougher penalties than we've ever had, and we will be focusing on the penalty that I talked about previously for the big pushers, the ones that are really killing so many people. And that penalty is going to be the death penalty.\"\n\nAs he did on the campaign trail, Trump then tied the epidemic -- and his drug strategy -- to immigration at the southern border.\n\nSheriff Richard K. Jones of Butler County, Ohio, says too much money is being spent on drug treatment programs and not enough on drug prevention and education. \"Any politician who says we're winning this battle with drugs is telling you a lie,\" he says. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\n\"Ninety percent of the heroin in America comes from our southern border, where, eventually, the Democrats will agree with us, and we'll build the wall to keep the damn drugs out,\" he said.\n\n\"Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!\" the audience chanted.\n\nDEA officials have said that most of the fentanyl pouring into the United States is coming from China through the U.S. Postal Service and overnight express services. The majority of Mexican heroin and fentanyl is concealed in cars and tractor-trailers that come into the United States through legal ports of entry along the southern border, according to a 2018 DEA National Drug Threat Assessment. Federal agents say they are also seizing increasing amounts of fentanyl that is coming across the border between the legal ports of entry.\n\nThe day after the Manchester speech, Sessions directed his prosecutors to pursue the death penalty against major drug traffickers.\n\nAs Trump was calling for the death penalty, one of the cities that had a high fentanyl overdose death rate was running out of money to purchase naloxone, an overdose reversal drug. In Baltimore, fentanyl deaths had risen by nearly 5,000 percent between 2013 and 2017, and the death toll was continuing to climb.\n\nLeana Wen, the health commissioner in Baltimore at the time, had to choose who could receive the lifesaving medicine.\n\n\"We are rationing the medication that would save people's lives at the moment that they're overdosing,\" Wen recalled in a recent interview. \"How is that possible?\"\n\nIn a May 3, 2018, letter to Conway, Wen pleaded with the Trump administration to use its influence to lower the price of naloxone. The brand name of the drug, Narcan, cost $75 for two doses. In the previous three years, naloxone had reversed more than 10,000 overdoses in Baltimore, Wen said.\n\n\"We request that the Trump Administration establish a national program to procure naloxone treatments and supply them to state and local health and law enforcement programs,\" the letter said.\n\n\"Nothing happened,\" Wen said. \"We never heard back.\"\n\nConway said she never saw the letter.\n\n'It's all fentanyl now'\n\nBetween May and August 2018, an additional 10,520 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, the most recent time period for which CDC data is available. Colton Gutknecht, 20, a fashion design student from Peoria, Ariz., was one of them.\n\nSeveral nights a week, Christine Birhanzl drives the streets of Hamilton, a former paper and steel mill town in southwestern Ohio, handing out blankets, food and clothes to addicts.\n\nBirhanzl is a recovering addict herself. She is now a director at Sojourner Recovery Services, a treatment facility in Butler County. One man she tried to help was James Proffit, 40, who had lived on the streets for years. His path to fentanyl was typical. He started by taking large doses of OxyContin and then turned to heroin, not knowing it had been laced with fentanyl.\n\nJames Proffit smokes a cigarette at a Sojourner Recovery Services treatment facility in Hamilton, Ohio, in April. Proffit had overdosed four times before seeking treatment and has been in recovery since February. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\n\"It's all fentanyl now,\" Proffit said in an interview. \"The county is flooded with fentanyl.\"\n\nHe overdosed four times but kept using.\n\n\"It takes all the pain away,\" Proffit said. \"You get numb, and you don't feel nothing. That lasts about five hours, and then it starts to wear down, you get cold chills, start cramping up and get sore. And then you have to do it again.\"\n\nBirhanzl finally succeeded in getting Proffit help, but only because he was arrested and faced the prospect of six months in jail. He remembered meeting Birhanzl on the street and how she tried to convince him to seek treatment. He asked the judge whether he could get into her program.\n\n\"Christine was my guardian angel,\" said Proffit, who has been clean since February. \"She never gave up on me. They turned me around 180 degrees.\"\n\nMedicaid paid for his stay at Sojourner Recovery Services. Ohio was one of the states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA -- also known as Obamacare -- which covers drug treatment for thousands like Proffit.\n\nLast August, four cities sued the administration for undermining the act. The cities -- Baltimore, Chicago, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio -- accused the administration of actively discouraging enrollment, raising rates and limiting health-care services.\n\nIn March, the Justice Department sided with 20 Republican-led states seeking to invalidate the entire act as unconstitutional. Trump then said Senate GOP leaders were writing legislation to repeal and replace the ACA. But Republicans quickly signaled that they had little appetite for raising an explosive issue just as the 2020 political season was getting underway.\n\nProffit waits in line to take his daily medication at the Sojourner treatment facility. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nHe works on an application for the next phase of the drug treatment program. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nThat same month, the White House proposed slashing Medicaid by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, which could further undercut drug treatment coverage nationwide.\n\nTrump's assistant secretary for health, Adm. Brett P. Giroir, said if Medicaid is cut and the ACA is declared unconstitutional, those programs would have to be replaced so tens of thousands would not be left without coverage.\n\n\"If you did something like eliminated coverage for everyone, that would not certainly be positive, unless it's replaced with something that provided equal or more coverage,\" said Giroir, senior opioid adviser to the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nIn Ohio, fentanyl is ravaging parts of the state and \"overwhelming the system,\" Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said in an interview. While the overall drug overdose death toll declined by 21 percent in the state between 2017 and 2018, deaths from fentanyl continue to rise. The senator has sponsored legislation to increase federal funding to help the hardest-hit areas of the country. Since 2017, Ohio has received $140 million from the federal government, but he said he knows it's not enough.\n\n\"I'm just trying to fight to keep the funding increasing every year,\" Portman said. \"I got some pushback from some of my colleagues on the Republican side of the issue, saying, 'Where's the money coming from?' I said, 'This is a crisis. This is a national emergency.' \"\n\nIn Clark County, outside Dayton, fentanyl overdoses are fueling large cost overruns for government services -- foster care, paramedics and police.\n\n\"It's very stressful for my deputies. They're seeing more death than they've ever seen,\" said Deborah K. Burchett, the sheriff of Clark County, which had the sixth-highest fentanyl overdose death rate in the nation. \"Our biggest problem is, our drug addicts also have mental health problems, and all the hospitals have been closed. They all wind up in the jail.\"\n\nProffit reads a book about drug recovery in his room at the treatment facility. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nHealth-care officials and drug treatment experts in Clark County say they are starting to see drug treatment money from Washington, but more is needed. Ending the ACA or cutting Medicaid, they said, would be disastrous.\n\n\"I can't even imagine a world like that,\" said Greta Mayer, who runs the Mental Health & Recovery Board of Clark, Greene and Madison Counties in Ohio. \"All of what we've gained would be lost.\"\n\n'We've got to move quickly'\n\nOn Jan. 2, 2019, the Senate confirmed James W. Carroll Jr. to be Trump's first permanent drug czar. A former Washington-based counsel to the Ford Motor Co., Carroll had served as Trump's deputy chief of staff. It had been two years since Trump took office.\n\n\"You've got the worst drug crisis we've had ever, and it takes you two years to get somebody in the White House who wakes up every day thinking about the problems?\" said Keith Humphreys, who served as a drug policy adviser to the George W. Bush and Obama administrations. \"That to me is just an astounding dereliction of duty.\"\n\nCarroll, who had been appointed acting drug czar in February 2018, disputed that characterization and said the administration has taken numerous steps to combat the opioid crisis. He noted the drug czar's office is only one of several agencies that are trying to battle the epidemic and he is in close contact with them. Despite the repeated attempts by the Office of Management and Budget to slash his budget, Carroll said he has the full support of the White House. He also said he has proposed spending an additional $1.3 billion on anti-drug efforts.\n\n\"This is a priority for the president,\" Carroll said in an interview.\n\nHe acknowledged that the government needs to spend more money and move faster.\n\n\"I am fiscally conservative, but I also believe that it's going to require more of a financial investment, spent wisely, to get our arms around this,\" he said. \"We've got to move quickly.\"\n\nA man at the entrance of Baltimore's Penn-North Metro station in April snorts fentanyl, according to the man who gave it to him, from a credit card.

(Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nConway agreed and said the administration is making important strides.\n\nShe pointed out that the administration had launched an opioid prevention ad campaign. Dogs are being trained to detect fentanyl at ports of entry. Congress directed the U.S. Postal Service to start electronically tracking packages from foreign countries.The CDC has begun improving overdose collection data to provide a clearer picture of what is happening on the ground. The administration has formed an \"opioid cabinet\" with representatives from key government agencies, and Conway said they secured an additional $6 billion from Congress to combat the crisis.\n\nTrump also signed a bipartisan legislative package weeks before the 2018 midterm election that creates, expands and renews programs designed to fight the epidemic. Last month, the president secured a promise from Chinese President Xi Jinping to ban all variants of fentanyl, although government officials said it is too early to tell whether the Chinese government will follow through amid the escalating trade war.\n\nFor Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the fentanyl epidemic has hit home; he has represented Baltimore both in the state capital and in Washington for the past 36 years. He has introduced legislation that calls for spending $100 billion to combat the opioid epidemic.\n\nWhile the fentanyl epidemic has mostly affected white Americans, the drug is increasingly claiming more African American lives in cities like Washington, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Baltimore. Between 2013 and 2017, 1,261 people died from fentanyl overdoses in Baltimore, which has the second-highest number of fentanyl-related overdose deaths per capita in the country. The Maryland Department of Health found that an additional 566 people died in the first nine months of 2018, the most recently available data for the city. That far exceeds the number of homicides committed during the entire year, when 309 people were murdered in Baltimore.\n\nAt a Metro stop in West Baltimore recently, down the block from an open-air drug market, members of the nonprofit Bmore Power handed out free doses of Narcan. Steve Diggs, 47, said he had peddled drugs on the streets of the city for nearly 30 years. Now in recovery and working for the group, he and other former drug dealers and users are trying to prevent more deaths, which he said started to soar with the arrival of fentanyl in 2015.\n\nBaltimore's Penn-North Metro station sits in a section of the city known for heavy trafficking of heroin and fentanyl.

I know what they're going through.\"\n\nOn March 7, Cummings, as the new chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, summoned the White House's newly confirmed drug czar to testify before his panel. He said he was angry it had taken Carroll so long to appear.\n\n\"Last year, I repeatedly asked for Mr. Carroll to testify before us as the acting director of [the drug czar's office], but he refused,\" Cummings said, listing the times Carroll had delayed appearing.\n\nCummings also was furious that the White House had not produced its National Drug Control Strategy to Congress. It was two years past the congressionally required deadline. Instead of submitting a strategy that normally consisted of more than 100 pages of detailed plans, Carroll had given the committee what Cummings called a 23-page \"pamphlet\" that did not outline specific goals or measurable objectives. At the hearing, Triana McNeil, a director of the Government Accountability Office, said the document failed to meet congressional requirements.\n\n\"The White House office charged with leading our nation's efforts to combat the drug crisis has been missing in action as deaths continue to mount,\" Cummings said. \"The White House had no National Drug Control Strategy. None. None. All while tens of thousands of people were dying and the crisis was escalating every day.\"\n\nCarroll said he was personally committed to fighting the drug crisis, noting that a member of his own family was struggling with addiction.\n\n\"I want every family to have a success story that I really hope and pray that my family is having,\" Carroll said.\n\nCarroll also promised to provide the panel with a more complete drug strategy with \"quantifiable metrics.\" Two months later, on May 9, Carroll and McNeil returned to the committee. Carroll submitted several new documents, which he said met congressional requirements.\n\nMcNeil told the panel she had reviewed the documents and asked rhetorically whether the GAO could say that the drug czar's office has finally produced the congressionally mandated drug strategy.\n\n\"Not at this time,\" she testified.\n\nA man huddles in an abandoned garage in a drug-riddled section of Baltimore's Mount Vernon neighborhood in April.

Within two days, nearly $1 billion was raised to help pay for the restoration of the 856-year-old cathedral in Paris.\n\nThe charitable response was a reflection of Notre-Dame's stature as a cherished monument of French cultural heritage. Some benefactors pledged more than $100 million each, including Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, whose wealth comes from luxury brands like Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, and Bernard Arnault, the richest person in Europe and chief executive of the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH.\n\nBut the outpouring met with resistance as critics wondered why tragedies like the incineration of the National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro in September did not receive the same degree of support. And it rekindled class resentment in a city already racked by the so-called Yellow Vest movement, a populist response to economic inequality in France that tapped into a rising global movement against the concentration of wealth.\n\nSome criticism was aimed at donors for not paying their fair share in taxes and thus depriving the French government of the revenue to repair Notre-Dame itself. Others denounced the reputational boost bestowed on philanthropists at a time of national tragedy. And some attacked the premise of giving so much to a damaged cathedral when that money could better benefit social service organizations that could provide food, shelter or a better education to needy citizens.\n\nBut philanthropic experts and advisers said they were not shocked by what seemed like an ungrateful response.\n\n\"It's not surprising,\" said Nicolas Berggruen, a billionaire philanthropist who founded the Berggruen Institute in Los Angeles, which aims to reshape political and social institutions to develop long-term solutions to society's challenges. \"In the age of anxiety, people will look to accuse lots of different groups for all of the evil or some of the evil. Rich people for sure fall into this. Philanthropists are an extension of that.\"\n\nOthers took a less philosophical approach, saying that for society to be most effective, philanthropists need to work with government and the private sector, not alone or in opposition to them.\n\n\"Instead of praising the act of philanthropy itself, people are saying it's not the highest and best use of that capital,\" said Nick Tedesco, senior philanthropic adviser at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. \"When did we get to a place where we feel comfortable criticizing other people's altruism?\"\n\nIf such critical responses toward prominent donations becomes a trend, donors could be forced to rethink big gifts. Some are worried that could have a chilling effect on giving, while others hope it forces people to think differently about what their money supports.\n\nThose who are worried about the backlash think anger over unequal distribution of wealth is bleeding into the wrong areas.\n\n\"There's a lot of understandable concern about wealth inequality and a lot of concern about the bad behavior of some,\" said Phil Buchanan, chief executive of the Center for Effective Philanthropy and the author of \"Giving Done Right.\"\n\n\"But I worry that we're conflating concerns over our approach to taxation with a critique of philanthropy, and I don't actually follow the logic,\" he added. \"I don't believe most big philanthropists are motivated by a desire to maintain the status quo via their giving or to protect themselves from higher taxation.\"\n\nHe said private philanthropic organizations like the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation supported ideas that had become part of the social fabric, like the 911 emergency system and the field of nurse practitioners. And the Libra Foundation, which is backed by a part of the Pritzker family, supplied $350,000 in grants to organizations addressing the needs of families being separated at the United States-Mexico border.\n\nMr. Buchanan said that to solve social problems, all three sectors of society -- public, private and philanthropic -- needed to do the jobs they were meant to do at a high level, not be sidetracked by a backlash.\n\n\"What I'm more concerned about is the broad-brush critique of the whole concept of giving and the under-appreciation of all the good giving has done,\" he said. \"We need a healthy civil society doing different things.\"\n\nMr. Tedesco had a different concern: that already too much money earmarked for philanthropy was not being put to use.\n\n\"With Notre-Dame, you were able to tap into otherwise dormant philanthropic capital,\" he said. \"But that leads to the question: Why is philanthropic capital lying idle? The nonprofit organizations don't know how to compel donors to give.\"\n\nInstead of shying from criticism, philanthropists should accept it as the cost of trying out new things that may not work, Mr. Tedesco said. \"You should be more willing to own that criticism because it shows you're attempting to find solutions or approaches that will ultimately get to success.\"\n\nBut for those who would rather avoid backlash, anonymity is always an option. Caroline W. Hodkinson, director of philanthropic advisory at Bessemer Trust, said some of the firm's wealthiest clients were opting to use limited liability companies to hold money that was earmarked for philanthropy but that could also be used for impact investing. The investment vehicles give donors greater flexibility over how the money is managed, but they also provide near-total anonymity.\n\n\"A private foundation is about the least private thing you can have,\" she said. By meeting Internal Revenue Service reporting requirements, \"you're opening up your affairs to the world,\" she said.\n\nAnonymity on large gifts is also fairly easy to arrange. \"It's a business negotiation,\" said Jared Feldman, who, as the partner in charge of the private client group at the accounting firm Anchin, has worked on four gifts of more than $100 million each.\n\nBut anonymity presents a problem because of its inherent lack of transparency.\n\n\"I'm concerned about the anonymity issue,\" said Lawson Bader, chief executive of DonorsTrust, a donor-advised fund. Knowing who a benefactor is helps build trust, he said, whereas anonymity can hide potential conflicts. For instance, museums are re-examining gifts from the Sackler family, a prominent donor in the art world, after its involvement in the opioid crisis became known. Had the donations been made anonymously, they would not be under scrutiny now.\n\nSome critics hope that the backlash goes beyond assessing the merits of certain donors and donations and instead forces a wholesale re-evaluation of philanthropy.\n\nAnand Giridharadas, author of \"Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World,\" said he found the criticism of the donations to Notre-Dame healthy and wanted to see more of it. \"I've been advocating for exactly that kind of reaction,\" he said. \"It is not hostility to giving. It's simply an injection of skepticism about this kind of exertion of power.\"\n\nWhen philanthropists, particularly in the tech world, make sweeping pronouncements like Mark Zuckerberg's $3 billion plan to cure all disease, Mr. Giridharadas said, society needs to tone down its adulation and be skeptical.\n\nMr. Giridharadas said he would like to see philanthropists make gifts instead to organizations that shake up the social order. \"The kind of giving I advocate is 'being a traitor to your class' giving,\" he said.\n\nUnlike Mr. Giridharadas, who supports shaking up norms, Mr. Berggruen is focused on helping democracies work better by drawing on the best philanthropic traditions.\n\n\"What philanthropists have done in America is much more to put their money to use in society,\" he said. \"The state has a role, but Bill Gates can take more risk than the private sector can and take different kinds of risk than the state can take. In America, on the whole, that's been beneficial.\"\n\nAside from the backlash, the debate stirred by the donations to Notre-Dame has also raised hope.\n\n\"The takeaway form Notre-Dame is, if that can happen in 24 hours, the resources are there to take on major issues,\" said Rob Hansen, founder of Goodnation, which measures the impact of donations. \"Imagine instead of redirecting that billion dollars, we raise another billion dollars to other causes.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_sullivan@nytimes.com", "name": "Paul Sullivan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/26/business/26wealth1/26wealth1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 296243220}, {"uri": "1142359004", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "10:51:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T10:51:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4627451002597809, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/warrens-ambitious-agenda-relies-on-a-massive-wealth-tax-that-the-rich-may-evade/2019/05/21/900d72c4-78a4-11e9-bd25-c989555e7766_story.html", "title": "Warren's ambitious agenda relies on a massive wealth tax that the rich may evade", "body": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) pauses as she speaks during a campaign event at River's Bend Bed & Breakfast in Iowa Falls, Iowa, on May 3. (Daniel Acker/For The Washington Post) By Toluse Olorunnipa Toluse Olorunnipa White House reporter May 22 at 6:00 AM\n\nSix words -- increasingly met with cheers on the campaign trail -- have come to encapsulate Elizabeth Warren's position as the leading ideas candidate in the crowded Democratic presidential primary: \"I've got a plan for that.\"\n\nIn town halls across the country, Warren has promoted her plans to offer Americans free college, universal child care, student debt cancellation and more -- all paid for by raising taxes on the superwealthy.\n\nTaken as a whole, the Massachusetts senator's transformative slate of social programs and tax increases could amount to the largest transfer of wealth from the richest Americans to the middle class in U.S. history.\n\nBut Warren's ambitious agenda relies on two assumptions that defy a long history of U.S. policymaking: First, that the country's wealthiest taxpayers won't find ways to evade the targeted tax hike she proposes, and second, that new entitlement programs won't result in ballooning costs that plunge the federal government deeper into debt.\n\n\"She's gone big. There's nothing small about these proposals,\" said Mark Zandi, who, as chief economist at Moody's Analytics, has analyzed policies for Warren and other presidential candidates. \"Will the wealthy do things that wealthy people can do to avoid paying the tax? That's the real concern that I have. .\u2009.\u2009. A lot of other countries have tried this and backtracked because of tax avoidance issues.\"\n\nWhile other candidates have offered general platforms and principles, Warren has outpaced the field in outlining specific policies and detailing how she would pay for them. As her \"I've-got-a-plan\" mantra has caught fire with voters in recent weeks, her poll numbers have also risen, highlighting the hunger many Democratic primary voters have for fleshed-out policy prescriptions.\n\n[Graphic: We're asking 2020 Democrats where they stand on key issues]\n\nSince launching her presidential campaign, Warren has rolled out a domestic platform that, so far, her campaign estimates would cost a combined $3 trillion over 10 years -- plans that include canceling student debt for almost every American, building 3 million affordable housing units, reducing rents by 10 percent nationwide, shrinking the black-white wealth gap by 4 percentage points, subsidizing child-care for all young families, offering universal prekindergarten, providing universal opioid treatment and eliminating the National Park Service's maintenance backlog while making all national parks free.\n\nAttendees sit in a living room ahead of a Warren campaign event at River's Bend Bed & Breakfast in Iowa Falls, Iowa, on May 3. (Daniel Acker/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe centerpiece of Warren's agenda is a 2 percent annual tax on household assets above $50 million, hitting the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans. Underscoring the populist themes that drive her candidacy, Warren often spends several minutes describing the \"wealth tax\" before laying out her ideas for free college, child care and pre-K.\n\n\"Think about that. That's how badly out of whack our economy has gotten -- that two cents on the greatest fortunes in this country would yield an investment in every one of our kids across this country,\" Warren said earlier this month at a Kermit, W.Va., town hall on the opioid crisis. \"I'm tired of freeloading billionaires.\"\n\nThe crowd broke into cheers several times as Warren described how a 2 percent tax on \"the diamonds, the yachts and the Rembrandts\" of multimillionaires would pay for a host of new social programs -- including a $100 billion plan to combat the opioid epidemic.\n\nBut some economists are beginning to question the math behind Warren's proposals.\n\nWarren's campaign claims that the wealth tax would raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years, enough to cover her spending plans with hundreds of billions of dollars to spare. She also has proposed a $1 trillion corporate tax on the most profitable companies.\n\nIn a Washington Post op-ed last month, former Obama administration economic adviser Lawrence Summers and University of Pennsylvania professor Natasha Sarin wrote \"such a wealth tax will not yield the revenue that its proponents hope for,\" citing figures from the current estate tax that show how the wealthy have proved adept in avoiding the 40 percent levy on their assets after death.\n\n\"The problem with their estimate is that they fail to engage with the fact that wealthy people do a lot of things that make it very hard to tax their estates, and will make it equally hard to tax their wealth,\" said Sarin, who teaches finance at the Wharton School of Business.\n\nA recent poll of about 40 top economists by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business found that 73 percent believed a wealth tax\"would be much more difficult to enforce than existing federal taxes\" because of tax evasion. Only 7 percent disagreed. Several cited the experience in Europe, where most countries have abandoned their wealth taxes in recent decades. Wealth taxes in the world's richest nations have brought in far less revenue than expected due to tax avoidance, according to a 2018 report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nQuentin Kooiker, 71, center, listens as Warren speaks during a campaign event at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, on May 3. (Daniel Acker/For The Washington Post)\n\nWarren declined a request to comment. A campaign aide cited research by University of California at Berkeley professors Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez, who came up with the wealth tax proposal and calculated the revenue estimate.\n\nIn an interview, Zucman said Warren's numbers are well-founded.\n\nZucman said Warren's plan is specifically designed in a way that limits tax evasion -- allowing no exemptions, increasing enforcement by the IRS and imposing heavy fines on people who try to skirt the tax by undervaluing assets, hiding their wealth abroad or renouncing their U.S. citizenship. The $2.75 trillion estimate includes an allowance for 15 percent tax avoidance, said Zucman, whose work with Saez on wealth concentration is respected by other economists.\n\n\"If it's properly enforced and there's a serious effort at having no exemptions and enforcing it strongly, then it can collect a lot of tax revenue,\" he said of the wealth tax. \"Tax avoidance, tax evasion -- these are not things that happen out of the blue. The government chooses to make taxes work, to enforce them well, or to not enforce them properly.\"\n\nEven as economists debate the feasibility of an \"ultra-millionaires tax,\" Warren has found it to be an effective political weapon on the stump. She talks about taxing the \"wealthiest 75,000 families in the country\" to illustrate how the wealth gains in recent decades have disproportionately flowed to the top 1 percent.\n\nHer plan offers an aggressive path to shrinking the wealth gap and has proved popular among broad swaths of the public.\n\nA February Politico-Morning Consult poll found that 61 percent of voters supported the wealth tax, while only 20 percent oppose it. Among Republicans, 50 percent supported it and 30 percent were opposed.\n\nAttendees wait to enter a Warren campaign event in Iowa Falls, Iowa. (Daniel Acker/For The Washington Post)\n\nWarren (D-Mass.) speaks during an interview in Iowa Falls, Iowa. (Daniel Acker/For The Washington Post)\n\nAnd even if the wealth tax proves more complex in practice than in theory -- it would certainly face legal challenges -- voters give Warren credit for offering fresh ideas to address such major issues as income inequality. Many are seeking a contrast to President Trump, who ascended to the presidency with a campaign heavy on slogans and light on policy details.\n\n\"They really have a good team,\" said Zandi, who has worked with Warren's aides to analyze plans for affordable housing and universal child care. \"That's why they're coming out with the most in-depth proposals.\"\n\nWarren's campaign has indicated that it will continue to roll out new policies. While Warren has voiced support for universal health care, paid sick leave and an expansive federal response to climate change, her campaign -- like others -- has yet to describe how those programs would be structured and funded.\n\nSome of the plans Warren has described in detail would create massive new entitlements, with the risk of overshooting budget estimates.\n\nWarren has promised that the government would pay all tuition and fees for students to attend public colleges. And she has proposed a universal child-care and pre-K program that would cap costs at 7 percent of family income. She also pledged to cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of borrowers who have it.\n\n\"College is a basic need that should be available for free to everyone who wants to go,\" Warren wrote in a Medium post describing her plan.\n\nWarren's estimated cost for her college and student loan plan totaled more than $1.25 trillion over 10 years.\n\nSandy Baum, a higher education fellow at the Urban Institute, said costs for free two- and four-year college could quickly spiral beyond estimates.\n\nUsing the example of a student in Pennsylvania contemplating where to go to college, Baum said a free public college program might incentivize more students to take advantage of the government benefit, raising potential costs.\n\n\"Right now, you might decide 'I'm not going to college in Pennsylvania. I'm going to go to a private college in Massachusetts,'\u2009\" she said. \"If it suddenly becomes free to go to Penn State, then that's going to be a very different choice. And some of those students are definitely going to say 'Penn State -- it's free.'\u2009\"\n\nThe Warren campaign did not provide an analysis of how it estimated the cost of its free-college program, which includes increasing Pell grants and creating a $50 billion fund for historically black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions.\n\n\"It's a lot of money,\" said Baum. \"If it accomplishes its goal of getting more people to go to college and stay there for a longer time, it'll be more expensive.\"\n\nCraig Taylor eats lunch as Warren holds a campaign rally on the other side of a wall inside Taste, a restaurant in Osage, Iowa, on May 3.

(Daniel Acker/For The Washington Post)\n\nWarren's child care and early education proposal is one of her most costly initiatives. Citing estimates from Moody's, Warren's campaign said providing free child care for families below 200 percent of the federal poverty line and subsidizing care for almost everyone else would cost about $1.1 trillion over 10 years. That total is reduced to $700 billion if you include the benefits of economic growth, the campaign said.\n\nBut Zandi, who wrote the Moody's analysis for the campaign, acknowledged that the child-care program could ultimately be more expensive. One risk is that the free benefit could attract more users than forecast, driving up costs.\n\n\"It's very possible the takeup could be more significant that what I've anticipated,\" Zandi said, adding that there's also a chance that economic growth could be greater than forecast, canceling out additional costs.\n\nWarren's conservative critics have chafed at her claim that such a major expansion of government benefits could be financed only by taxing the wealthy. Some also predict that higher taxes on the rich -- quickly compounding at 2 percent annually -- will have unintended consequences for the economy, shrinking growth.\n\n\"That's one of the things about taxes -- they change behavior,\" said Michael Strain, an economist at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. \"If you tax savings, you'll get less savings. That will hurt investment, which will hurt productivity. And that will hurt wages.\"\n\nBut Warren is banking on the idea that voters are ready to reject the kind of supply-side economics that have dominated much of U.S. policymaking for decades and embrace a new system aimed at reorienting the economy around the middle class.\n\nDuring a campaign stop last week in Philadelphia, Warren talked about how working families had fallen further behind as politicians catered to millionaires and large corporations. Then she described her push to fundamentally restructure government with an expansive social program financed by a historic tax increase on the wealthy.\n\n\"We need to make not some nibbles around the edge, not like one statute over here and a regulation over there in a little piece. What we need is big structural change in this country,\" she said to applause. \"And I've got a plan for that. In fact, I've got multiple plans for that.\"\n\nWarren speaks during a campaign event at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, on May 3.

On Wednesday, the American Museum of Natural History said that it, too, had ceased taking Sackler donations.\n\nThe moves reflect the growing outrage over the role the Sacklers may have played in the opioid crisis, as well as an energized activist movement that is starting to force museums to reckon with where some of their money comes from.\n\n\"The museum takes a position of gratitude and respect to those who support us, but on occasion, we feel it's necessary to step away from gifts that are not in the public interest, or in our institution's interest,\" said Daniel H. Weiss, the president of the Met. \"That is what we're doing here.\"\n\nThe Met's relationship with the Sacklers goes back decades, and one of its biggest attractions, the Temple of Dendur, sits in the glass-enclosed Sackler Wing. Mr. Weiss said the museum had no plans to remove the name, as some protesters have demanded.\n\nBut its decision to stop accepting future gifts from Sacklers connected to Purdue Pharma, or their foundations, could spur other cultural institutions to follow suit. The family has given tens of millions of dollars and put its name in or on museums, universities and medical schools in the United States, England and Israel.\n\n\"An organization of the Met's reputational heft sets standards in the field,\" said Maxwell L. Anderson, a longtime leader of museums.\n\nIn the New York area alone, in addition to the Met, the Guggenheim and the Natural History museum, the Metropolitan Opera and the Dia Art Foundation are among the institutions that have received substantial gifts from the Sacklers. Columbia University, which has the Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology, has said it would not accept further donations for the time being.\n\nIn a statement, the Sackler family members with ties to Purdue Pharma said that \"while the allegations against our family are false and unfair, we understand that accepting gifts at this time would put the Met in a difficult position.\"\n\n\"We respect the Met and that is the last thing we would want to do,\" the statement said. \"Our goal has always been to support the valuable work of such outstanding organizations, and we remain committed to doing so.\"\n\nThe move by the Met comes as the Whitney Museum finds itself caught in the politics of the era, facing growing calls from artists, protesters and even some museum staff members to remove one of its vice chairmen, Warren B. Kanders, from its board. Mr. Kanders is the chief executive of Safariland Group, which sells equipment to law enforcement agencies and militaries, including tear gas, which the art publication Hyperallergic said was used against migrants at the Mexican border.\n\nDozens of artists connected to the Whitney Biennial, a prestigious contemporary art exhibition that begins on Friday, signed an open letter calling for his resignation. And a group called Forensic Architecture, in partnership with Praxis Films, has made its Biennial exhibition a direct challenge to Mr. Kanders: It will show a 10-minute film that documents instances when Safariland's Triple-Chaser tear gas grenades have been deployed.\n\nMr. Kanders has rebuffed the demands for him to step down, saying that Safariland's products, which also include riot gear and bomb disposal robots, protect law enforcement officers and let them defuse dangerous situations without loss of life. He said he had no role in how the company's products were ultimately deployed.\n\nThe increased scrutiny on donors is forcing museums to navigate moral dilemmas and a political climate where a protest can go viral in a matter of hours. At the same time, they must mollify the wealthy benefactors who help keep the lights on and would rather not see their donations open them up to public examination.\n\n\"There really aren't that many people who are giving to art and giving to museums, in fact it's a very small club,\" said Tom Eccles, the executive director of the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College. \"So we have to be a little careful what we wish for here.\"\n\nThere is also the difficult question of where to draw a line. What sort of behavior is inexcusable?\n\n\"We are not a partisan organization, we are not a political organization, so we don't have a litmus test for whom we take gifts from based on policies or politics,\" said Mr. Weiss of the Met. \"If there are people who want to support us, for the most part we are delighted.\"\n\n\"We would only not accept gifts from people if it in some way challenges or is counter to the core mission of the institution, in exceptional cases,\" he added. \"The OxyContin crisis in this country is a legitimate and full-blown crisis.\"\n\nThree brothers, Arthur, Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, bought a small company called Purdue Frederick in 1952 and transformed it into the pharmaceutical giant it is today. In 1996, Purdue Pharma put the opioid painkiller OxyContin on the market, fundamentally altering the company's fortunes.\n\nThe family's role in the marketing of OxyContin, and in the opioid crisis, has come under increased scrutiny in recent years. Documents submitted this year as part of litigation by the attorney general of Massachusetts allege that members of the Sackler family directed the company's efforts to mislead the public about the dangers of the highly addictive drug. The company has denied the allegations and said it \"neither created nor caused the opioid epidemic.\"\n\nArthur Sackler died before OxyContin's creation and his side of the family, which has supported institutions including the Smithsonian and the Brooklyn Museum, sold his stake in the pharmaceutical business after his death. One of his children, Elizabeth A. Sackler, has called the company's role in the opioid epidemic \"morally abhorrent.\"\n\nMr. Weiss, who described the Met's decision as a \"suspension,\" said the museum would refuse only gifts from members of the Sackler family closely connected to Purdue. Several family members, or their charities, have given to the museum in recent years, including the Mortimer D. Sackler Foundation, which has donated at least $200,000 since 2012.\n\nThat is a relatively small amount for a museum with a $320 million annual budget, but the symbolism of the Met's decision was unmistakable.\n\nThe family's contributions to the Met go back some 50 years. A 1978 news release announcing the dedication of the Sackler Wing said it cost $9.5 million to build -- about $36 million in today's dollars -- and called the Sacklers \"major donors\" to the project. At the dedication reception, which was jointly hosted by the Met and the three brothers, the Martha Graham Dance Company performed a new work at the Temple of Dendur, which was a gift from Egypt to the United States.\n\nNan Goldin, a photographer who overcame an OxyContin addiction, has led demonstrations at institutions that receive Sackler money; in March 2018, she and her supporters dumped empty pill bottles in the Sackler Wing's reflecting pool.\n\n\"We commend the Met for making the ethical, moral decision to refuse future funding from the Sacklers,\" a group started by Ms. Goldin, Prescription Addiction Intervention Now, or PAIN, said in a statement. \"Fourteen months after staging our first protest there, we're gratified to know that our voices have been heard.\"\n\nThe group also called for the removal of the Sackler name from buildings the family has bankrolled. Mr. Weiss said that the museum would not take the more drastic step of taking the family's name off the wing, saying that it was not in a position to make permanent changes while litigation against the family was pending and information was still coming to light.\n\nThe Met also said that its board had voted to codify how the museum accepts named gifts, formalizing a longstanding practice of circulating those proposals through a chain of departments. The decision on the Sacklers, Mr. Weiss said, was made by the Met leadership in consultation with the board.\n\nThe Museum of Natural History has also had a long relationship with the Sacklers. It has received at least $6 million from the Mortimer D. Sackler Foundation since 2006, including funding for the museum's Sackler Educational Laboratory, according to the foundation's tax returns. A museum spokeswoman said that it had no intention of accepting Sackler gifts \"in the foreseeable future.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_a_harris@nytimes.com", "name": "Elizabeth A.

Now They Say It Was a Fraud.", "body": "BECKLEY, W.Va. -- On a spring day in 2017, Stephanie Frame sat down in her hilltop home deep in the mountain hollows to record a video.\n\nShe began with the litany of local decline: the vanishing jobs in the coal mines, the shuttering stores, the school that closed down. During one stretch of unemployment for her coal miner husband, the two had resorted to selling ramps, ginseng and yellowroot that they had dug up in the forest.\n\nBut this video, aimed at her neighbors, was an announcement: Redemption was here. A nonprofit called Mined Minds, promising to teach West Virginians how to write computer code and then get them well-paying jobs, was looking for recruits.\n\n\"I wholeheartedly believe, and will always believe,\" Ms. Frame said to the camera, \"that God has sent Mined Minds to us to save us from what could have been a very bleak future.\"\n\nShe had every reason to believe. Joe Manchin III, her Democratic senator, had invited the group to come into the state. The National Guard hired it to teach at its military-style academy. County commissioners arranged space rent free. National news outlets gave glowing coverage.\n\nMany West Virginians like Ms. Frame signed up for Mined Minds, quitting their jobs or dropping out of school for the prized prospect of a stable and lucrative career. But the revival never came.\n\nAlmost none of those who signed up for Mined Minds are working in programming now. They described Mined Minds as an erratic operation, where guarantees suddenly evaporated and firings seemed inevitable, leaving people to start over again at the bottom rungs of the wage jobs they had left behind.\n\nOver two dozen former students in West Virginia are pursuing a lawsuit, arguing that Mined Minds was a fraud. Out of the 10 or so people who made it to the final weeks of Ms. Frame's class in Beckley, only one formally graduated. He is now delivering takeout.\n\n\"It was a too-good-to-be-true kind of deal,\" said Billyjack Buzzard, 33, who attended another class and was the only former West Virginia coal miner to finish classes and get a job with the program. He was fired after 14 months and went back underground. \"Just false hope.\"\n\nMined Minds came into Appalachia espousing a certain dogma, fostered in the world of start-ups and TED Talks, and carried with missionary zeal into places in dire need of economic salvation. The group was premised on the notion, as one grant proposal read, that \"anyone can have a successful career in the technology industry,\" and that if enough people did, the whole area would be transformed.\n\nAmanda Laucher, one of the founders of Mined Minds, spoke at a tech conference in 2017 of the group's ambitions, which were swiftly expanding. \"Yeah, we helped a town, we actually made some small impact,\" she said of Mined Minds' early efforts. \"But can we scale it and actually diversify the economy of an entire region?\"\n\nThis would be an audacious goal even in the best of circumstances. But Mined Minds was operating with a limited amount of personal cash and public funding, and was mostly staffed by people who had spent little time in tech.\n\nMs. Laucher now acknowledges that while she is still committed to the group's mission, the work has not been easy. \"Progress is difficult,\" she said in an email, \"with the current atmosphere in Appalachia which is deeply interested in maintaining a 'culture.'\"\n\nShe blamed the opioid epidemic and \"the poverty culture\" of the region, mentioning \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" the best-selling memoir by J.D. Vance, who, like Ms. Laucher, went from working-class Rust Belt roots to success in the tech sector.\n\nShe added: \"There are generations of hard work ahead. We'll be only a tiny force working toward change in the area I grew up.\"\n\nNone of this -- neither the experience itself nor Ms. Laucher's thoughts about its difficulties -- strikes some former students as surprising. This is, they say, how things tend to go in Appalachia.\n\n\"I get angry at people who go to other places and say, 'My culture is better than theirs and I am going to change it,'\" said Katie Bolyard, 25, a college graduate who skipped her honeymoon to take a class.\n\nShe doesn't know the motives of the people at Mined Minds, she said, whether they had bad intentions or were just \"incredibly sloppy\" with good ones. But intentions only matter so much. \"It's not your life you're messing with.\"\n\n'They All Find a Job'\n\nBefore the founding of Mined Minds, Ms. Laucher and her husband, Jonathan Graham, were living in Chicago working as successful tech consultants. But in 2015, she learned that her younger brother, Marvin, had been laid off from a mine back in the coalfields of southwest Pennsylvania where she grew up.\n\nHe was stuck in the Appalachian dilemma: technologically savvy, as modern miners have to be, but stuck with few options. So Mr. Graham and Ms. Laucher quit their jobs and moved to Pennsylvania.\n\nThe model for Mined Minds, at least initially, was this: a free 16-week coding boot camp, followed by paid \"apprenticeships\" with the program's for-profit arm, a software consultancy. Apprentices worked full-time on projects for company clients, but were also called upon to teach in the classes they had graduated from months earlier. After working for a few months, apprentices would either go on to salaried jobs at the Mined Minds company, or to a big tech firm such as Oracle.\n\n\"Every single one of them\" finds work, Ms. Laucher said of the boot camp graduates, in a 2017 interview. \"They all find a job.\"\n\nA guarantee like that was barely short of miraculous. Within two years, Mined Minds was one of the primary beneficiaries of a $1.5 million grant from the Appalachian Regional Commission. In August 2016, Mr. Manchin, who encouraged the couple to expand from Pennsylvania, said that Mr. Graham and Ms. Laucher \"embody the spirit of West Virginia.\"\n\nIn the spring of 2017, Tori Frame, Stephanie Frame's daughter, was making $10 an hour as an assistant manager at a Family Dollar store when she learned about Mined Minds.\n\n\"I didn't want to be stuck in Gauley Bridge, W.Va., my whole life working at Family Dollar,\" said Tori, 23. \"I wanted something different.\"\n\nOthers viewed Mined Minds the same way. Andrew Farley figured he could quickly make the pay scale in coding that he made working for the railroad, but without having to leave his hometown; Chris Phelps, who washed dishes at a Cracker Barrel, thought a tech career was a way to get out of town.\n\nTy Cook, 29, a bank teller, saw something more, \"something that would make me a worthwhile member of society.\"\n\nAnd there was an irresistible promise: They would be paid to take the class. Some were told this in an email by a state jobs counselor, others said they were told by Ms. Laucher. The counselor said in an email they would receive $10 an hour, with the potential for more as apprentices or when they were hired. A number of people, including Tori, quit their jobs. (Ms. Laucher has denied making any such promise.)\n\nIn late June 2017, a big crowd gathered in a classroom at a small college campus in Beckley. They met Marvin Laucher, Ms. Laucher's brother, the former coal miner, now their main instructor. They also learned that they were not going to be paid. Some dropped out the first week.\n\nBut Tori and her mother, Stephanie, 45, stayed. Every weekday morning, Tori would wake up early, her mother would feed the chickens and together they would head down the serpentine mountain road to Beckley. Nights and weekends they spent in the glow of their laptops -- bought from a website on credit -- learning the rudiments of Ruby, the programming language.\n\nThere was never much of a syllabus; students would be given an assignment and spend the next few days trying to figure it out, mostly by themselves. The usual answer to questions, multiple students said, was \"Google it.\" A few quietly wondered how much their teachers really knew.\n\nUnease began to settle in among some of the students. They began to learn from their teaching assistants, graduates of a recent Mined Minds class, that the good stable jobs promised by the group were not nearly as stable as they appeared.\n\nFirings and resignations were routine among the staff. One of the Beckley teaching assistants, a 33-year-old named Maxx Turner, had already been fired, then rehired after several fruitless months of searching for programming work, he said. Some began to suspect that the program couldn't afford the job guarantee it was advertising.\n\nMoney woes did not make sense, given what they saw of the founders' lifestyle: the travels worldwide, the views from an office in Chicago's Trump Tower, the ever-replenishing tequila bottles at the West Virginia headquarters, the boozy house parties in Pennsylvania.\n\nSeveral former Mined Minds staff members described company gatherings the same way: Their bosses ordering seemingly endless shots, hectoring the more timid drinkers. \"I thought by going out drinking with them I'd put myself in a better position,\" said Michael Moore, 35, the other teaching assistant in Beckley, who dropped out of community college to take the program.\n\nThe promised 16-week class went on 17 weeks. Then 18, then 19. As the class continued, many students began to run out of money. Out of the more than two dozen students who began, about 10 were left by late October, some playing computer games in class to pass the time, just waiting for the final project before graduation.\n\nA Fateful Trip\n\nEarly on, Ms. Laucher had suggested the project would be something for the community, maybe a gaming app addressing the opioid epidemic. Then the project was finally announced: the design of a website for a pet bed-and-breakfast that Ms. Laucher's mother was opening in Pennsylvania.\n\nBut Stephanie Frame was still a believer. When word spread of a trip by the Mined Minds leadership to a tech conference in Lithuania in November, she saw an opportunity. She had never been out of the country, but this was a way to lock in a job, for her and for her daughter. Her husband agreed to spend $1,000 on the trip.\n\n\"If I could hang with them,\" she remembered thinking, \"be one of them, show them how dedicated I am, how much I supported them, then we've got it.\"\n\nWhile Stephanie and others were in Lithuania, the rest of the class was debating whether to stick it out to graduation. A news station in Pennsylvania had reported on problems with the Mined Minds program there, including that nearly all the graduates of one class had been fired right after being hired as apprentices. The state of Pennsylvania ordered Mined Minds to cease operations for not having a license to run a school.\n\nOn a morning in late November, in the first class after the Lithuania conference, the students in Beckley arrived to a shocking development. Two people who had gone on the trip -- Stephanie Frame and Mr. Moore, their teaching assistant -- had been kicked out of the program.\n\nIn a video conference, Ms. Laucher told the class that Stephanie had been dismissed because of \"extreme sexual harassment, lots of drunkenness, basically behaving in a way that we wouldn't condone at Mined Minds.\"\n\nStephanie was stunned. She thought the trip had been successful. She had gotten very drunk, she said, but no one on the trip had mentioned anything like \"extreme sexual harassment.\" Mr. Moore said he had seen nothing like the harassment Ms. Laucher described, and that in any case, everyone had been drunk.\n\nHe would later be told that he was being dismissed for being belligerent one night of the trip, and also of having a drug problem -- a charge, he said, easily refuted by years of clean drug tests -- including one for Mined Minds.\n\nAs Ms. Laucher shared the news, other students were angry, and suspicious.\n\n\"Even in the moment I'm hearing this I'm thinking, 'O.K., this isn't adding up,'\" Mr. Phelps said.\n\nMs. Bolyard wondered whether Mined Minds simply couldn't afford the apprenticeships. \"They were just making excuses to get rid of people,\" she said.\n\nTori's parents told her to just finish the class, but she couldn't. She sent a formal resignation letter, citing broken promises and a \"party culture\" that turned her off. Nearly all of the other students, infuriated by the whole thing, followed.\n\n'It Repeats Itself'\n\nMined Minds has continued operating, holding new classes in Logan, another hard-luck coal town in West Virginia.\n\nIn mid-April of this year, Ms. Laucher reprimanded five employees for not making enough networking connections on LinkedIn, for neglecting to read a book she had assigned, \"The Start-Up of You,\" and for not submitting their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to her for help. The next day, all five were fired. The staff of the program in West Virginia, two of those former employees said, now consists of Ms. Laucher's brother and sister.\n\nAnd several weeks ago, Ms. Laucher announced on social media that she had been accepted to law school in Chicago.\n\nAsked if this was the end of Mined Minds, Ms. Laucher wrote: \"Absolutely not. Still going.\"\n\nSince the class in Beckley ended, Stephanie Frame has mostly stayed home.\n\nAs she recounted her experience with Mined Minds in her living room, her husband, Roger, just off work, sat down and listened. It's always the same here, he finally said.\n\n\"They're coming here promising stuff that they don't deliver,\" said Mr. Frame, his hands and face still gray with coal dust. \"People do that all the time. They've always done it to Appalachians.\"\n\nHe recalled the pittance his great-grandparents sold their mineral rights for, and what they got from it: the coal company tearing down mountains and building roads wherever it wanted. Timber, coal, oil and gas, \"it repeats itself,\" he said. \"It's like a never-ending cycle.\"\n\nMembers of the Beckley class still keep in touch on a private chat group they call \"Disenfranchised Appalachians.\" Nearly everyone they had worked alongside has quit or been fired, though some said they had learned a lot from their work at Mined Minds. One, usually described as the program's clear success, found a programming job in South Carolina.\n\nStephanie's daughter Tori, who had begun dating Ty Cook from the class, went back to the Family Dollar, starting over as a cashier. Over the next year, she worked her way up to become manager, a promotion that, Ms. Laucher said in a recent deposition for the lawsuit, was evidence of \"the logic and problem solving skills that came with Mined Minds training.\"\n\nA couple of months ago, however, Tori found a job at a call center in Columbus, Ohio. In late February, she and Mr. Cook packed their belongings in a trailer and left West Virginia.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "campbell_robertson@nytimes.com", "name": "Campbell Robertson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/01/us/00minerscode-03-promo/00minerscode-03-promo-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v3.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 296168700}, {"uri": "1141781717", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:04:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:04:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/opinion/sunday/met-sackler.html", "title": "Opinion | When Your Money Is So Tainted Museums Don't Want It", "body": "Mr. Giridharadas is the author of \"Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World.\"\n\nWhen it comes to blood money for the arts, how bloody is too bloody?\n\nOn Wednesday, the Metropolitan Museum of Art decided that money made from selling the opioids that have killed several hundred thousand people is too bloody. It announced it would no longer take donations from members of the Sackler family linked to OxyContin. \"On occasion, we feel it's necessary to step away from gifts that are not in the public interest,\" Daniel H. Weiss, the Met's president, said.\n\n\"Gifts that are not in the public interest.\" It is a pregnant, important phrase. Coming on the heels of similar decisions by the Tate Modern in London and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, the spurning of Oxy-cash seems to reflect a growing awareness that gifts to the arts and other good causes are not only a way for ultra-wealthy people to scrub their consciences and reputations. Philanthropy can also be central to purchasing the immunity needed to profiteer at the expense of the common welfare.\n\nPerhaps accepting tainted money in such cases isn't just giving people a pass. Perhaps it is enabling misconduct against the public.\n\nThis was the startling assertion made by New York State in its civil complaint, filed in March, against members of the Sackler family and others involved in the opioid crisis. It accused defendants of seeking to \"profiteer from the plague they knew would be unleashed.\" And the lawsuit explicitly linked Sackler do-gooding with Sackler harm-doing: \"Ultimately, the Sacklers used their ill-gotten wealth to cover up their misconduct with a philanthropic campaign intending to whitewash their decades-long success in profiting at New Yorkers' expense.\"\n\nIt was strong stuff: The State of New York was officially claiming that in taking Sackler money, arts institutions had allowed themselves to be used as lubricant in a death machine. \"It's a remarkable statement,\" Benjamin Soskis, a historian of philanthropy at the Urban Institute in Washington, told me this week, \"the sort of thing we heard from critics of philanthropy on the periphery of power but rarely, in recent decades, from those at the center.\"\n\nAre museums, opera houses, food pantries and other nonprofits to be held responsible for how their donors have made their money? It is a question being asked more and more as a century-old taboo shatters.\n\n\"No amount of charity in spending such fortunes can compensate in any way for the misconduct in acquiring them,\" Theodore Roosevelt said after John D. Rockefeller proposed starting a foundation in 1909. It was not a lonely thought at the time.\n\nBut in the decades since, not least because of the amount of philanthropic coin that has been spent (can it still be called bribing when millions are the recipients?), touching all corners of our cultural life, attitudes have changed. And, as I found in spending the last few years reporting on nonprofits and foundations, a deeply complicit silence took hold: It was understood that you don't challenge people on how they make their money, how they pay their taxes (or don't), what continuing deeds they may be engaged in -- so long as they \"give back.\"\n\nWhen I speak privately with people working in nonprofits, as I often do, especially younger people, I hear this complaint again and again: They agonize about having to stay quiet not only about their donors' membership in a class that has benefited from an age of inequality but also about specific conduct by many donors that often worsens the problems the donors and nonprofits are working to solve.\n\nAnd so the decision by the Met and the other museums may be a small sign that this compact is cracking -- and perhaps that nonprofits are taking a broader view of their role in public life: not only as doers of good in a particular area of work but also, if they're not careful, as enablers of broader, if more generalized, societal harm.\n\n\"Turning down money runs against the grain of the thinking that's long governed charitable boards -- that they are stewards of the interests of particular institutions, with considerations of broader public interest being peripheral,\" Mr. Soskis, the historian, said when I asked him about the Met. \"What we are seeing more and more of, through the spread of social media, and an increased willingness to critically engage major philanthropic gifts, is the assertion of the public's interest in the philanthropic exchange.\"\n\nRelatedMore on the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma.The Met Will Turn Down Sackler Money Amid Fury Over the Opioid CrisisMay 15, 2019Opinion | Barry Meier: Opioid Makers Are the Big Winners in Lawsuit SettlementsDec. 26, 2018Origins of an Epidemic: Purdue Pharma Knew Its Opioids Were Widely AbusedMay 29, 2018\n\nIt remains to be seen whether other arts institutions will follow the lead of the Met, Tate and Guggenheim -- and more broadly, whether the nonprofit sector will begin asking itself some deeply uncomfortable questions.\n\nShould anyone working to make cities better and more equitable take money from JPMorgan Chase, which paid a huge sum for its role in helping to bring about the 2008 mortgage disaster and financial crisis? Should anyone working to help families affected by President Trump's immigration policies take money from Mark Zuckerberg, whose soft-pedaling of Russian interference in the 2016 election allowed anti-immigrant hate to spread and potentially helped Mr. Trump gain votes? Should any health institution take money tied to Pepsi or Coca-Cola?\n\nMake no mistake: To ask these questions opens a can of worms. The Sacklers are an easy case. Once the complicity turns more diffuse, it is hard to say whether a nonprofit is participating in an injustice by taking money -- or doing the best it can in a flawed reality. What's next after this? Is there a statute of limitations on looking for blood money? What kind of moral purity test are these institutions supposed to use? Once you begin to raise these dilemmas, how do you actually draw those lines around what's acceptable?\n\nThe Met has already drawn some lines. It won't remove the Sackler name from its galleries; it won't return money already donated. What it should do is go beyond a single act of rebuffing to model a new process for evaluating money.\n\nPast and future donations could be judged on various criteria: Was the money legally and fairly made? Is the money owed to tax evasion or extreme legal tax avoidance? Is the museum effectively selling a modern papal indulgence for a sin that shouldn't be so easily pardoned? Does the donor have a duty of reparation to people they have exploited or harmed that gives those parties more of a right to the money?\n\nAnd the public should be brought into the process. Public-facing institutions enjoy the privilege of being untaxed, so citizens should be able to comment on and scrutinize prospective donations.\n\nThese questions will long be with us. These museums have forced an essential conversation. For far too long, generosity has been allowed to serve as a wingman of injustice; giving back disguises merciless taking; making a difference becomes inseparable from making a killing -- sometimes literally.

Now he has a sexy new life in Hollywood.", "body": "Russiagate felon. Hollywood denizen. Friend of Tom Arnold. Is there anything more 2019?\n\nThis is a story about stories. Most of them are crazy. Some of them are true. I first met George Papadopoulos, the unlikely trigger of an investigation that many thought would take down Donald Trump, on a balmy California day in December 2018, less than a week after his release from federal prison. He wore a gray suit, a white shirt and a maroon tie, and greeted me with a cheery handshake. He asked about my flight and told me how much he was enjoying life in Los Angeles so far. \"I thought people might be hostile,\" he said as we took an elevator to the Rooftop Grill at the nearby Montage hotel. Instead, \"they're just intrigued. Basically, 'Hi, nice to meet you, cool story.'\u2009\" We took a seat at an outdoor table, and he ordered a cafe Americano and a \"Green Vitality\" smoothie with kale, apple and chlorophyll. \"It's L.A.,\" he shrugged.\n\nHis 12 days in prison, he said, were worst before the fact. The reality of minimum-security confinement came as a relief. \"You're expecting you're going in to get raped and killed,\" he said. \"I get inside the prison, and the guards are basically mocking my sentence: 'You're more trouble for us than we are for you.'\u2009\"\n\nHe told me that he and his wife, Simona, had found a rental apartment near the Hollywood sign, and he confirmed a Washington Post report that he was running for Congress. \"I have some support,\" he said. \"There's a lot of interest, actually, in it.\" He had his eye on the 48th Congressional District, where a Democrat had just defeated Republican Dana Rohrabacher (\"Ro, Roka, what's his name -- Dana Rakaburger?\").\n\nIn person, he came across as warm, oddly guileless and eager to please. He made boastful claims. (\"I was on a first-name basis with Netanyahu for four years.\") He made ingratiating claims. (\"As an individual I'm more comfortable with Washington Post people like you than with, I dunno, the Daily Caller.\") And then there was his central claim: that the entire federal investigation of Trump had its origins in dirty tricks masterminded by a group of foreign and U.S. intelligence entities.\n\nIf you're among the Americans who aren't obsessed with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III or dependent on MSNBC or Fox News -- that is to say, the majority -- you might need to be reminded that George Papadopoulos is the onetime foreign policy adviser to Trump who pleaded guilty in October 2017 to having lied to the FBI about the timing and extent of his contact with a professor who promised to connect him to high Russian officials. This made him an object of cable-news fascination, a man posited by many to be the long-sought link between the Trump campaign and Moscow, the key to unlocking a Kremlin-Trump conspiracy.\n\nAlthough most people stopped believing anything so grandiose about him long before Mueller released the report of his collusion investigation, Papadopoulos, now 31, has managed to (sort of) stay prominent. He has released a book, \"Deep State Target,\" that lays out an alternate version of events, in which he was set up in a series of traps laid by the FBI, the CIA and foreign intelligence operatives. It has received enthusiastic endorsements on Fox News, where Papadopoulos has become a regular guest, and other right-leaning outlets.\n\nIn early October 2018, I began to correspond with Papadopoulos about writing a profile of him and his wife, with a view to understanding his version of events. If even half his claims checked out, they would upend everything we know about what has been called Russiagate. In late November, just before he was due to report to prison, we agreed to meet in Los Angeles after his release. So began my attempt to understand his story -- a project that would draw me into correspondence with Israeli officials, Swiss lawyers, Italian politicians, medical cannabis advocates, Hollywood filmmakers and comedian Tom Arnold. It was a movie with a deranged screenwriter and absurd characters -- what, in America in 2019, you might call the usual. But that was all the more reason to try to make sense of it.\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos spent 12 days in prison after pleading guilty in 2017 to having lied to the FBI.\n\nFirst, let us lay out the basics. George Papadopoulos grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, the son of a Greek American couple who divorced when he was 7. George and his younger brother, Dean, lived with their father, Antonios, until George was a sophomore in high school, and then the boys moved to Lincolnwood to live with their mother, Kiki. George graduated from DePaul University in 2009. In 2011, armed with a master's in security studies from University College London, he became a researcher at the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based neoconservative think tank, working with senior fellow Seth Cropsey, chiefly on a project to encourage an energy alliance among Greece, Cyprus and Israel, and a pipeline project that would exclude Turkey.\n\nIn 2015, soon after Trump descended the escalator at Trump Tower, Papadopoulos, eager to get into political life, tried to join the Trump campaign, with no success. Instead, a few months later, he landed a job as an adviser to presidential candidate Ben Carson. That lasted about two months, and in February 2016, Papadopoulos took a job at an organization called the London Center of International Law Practice, or LCILP. In early March 2016, after further outreach to the Trump campaign, he landed a role as an unpaid foreign policy adviser. Since one Trump campaign theme was to improve relations with Moscow, Papadopoulos spent several weeks trying to put together a meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin.\n\nPapadopoulos had no contacts with Russia, so he connected with someone who he believed did: a Maltese academic named Joseph Mifsud, who was a director at LCILP. On March 24, 2016, Papadopoulos wrote an email to Trump campaign co-chair Sam Clovis and the foreign policy team, saying that his \"good friend\" Mifsud had introduced him to a woman who was Putin's niece (she wasn't) and to the Russian ambassador in London (he hadn't) and that the Russians were \"keen to host us.\" In an email, Clovis counseled holding off on taking action before NATO allies were consulted but added, \"Great work.\"\n\nRelated Self-help author Marianne Williamson wants to be your healer in chief Candace Owens is the new face of black conservatism. But what does that really mean?\n\nFor the next several weeks, Papadopoulos was in regular contact with Mifsud. He also exchanged emails with a woman named Olga Polonskaya, a.k.a. \"Putin's niece,\" and with Ivan Timofeev of the Russian International Affairs Council, a prominent Moscow think tank. On May 10, Papadopoulos had drinks with Alexander Downer, Australia's high commissioner to the United Kingdom at the time, and mentioned that Moscow might reveal damaging information it had about Hillary Clinton. This was relayed to Canberra and later to the U.S. Embassy in London. Upon this basis, it has been reported, the FBI launched a counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign, code-named Crossfire Hurricane. In September, FBI informant Stefan Halper met Papadopoulos under the pretext of commissioning a report on oil fields in the Mediterranean, for which he ultimately paid Papadopoulos $3,000.\n\nIn late January 2017, soon after Trump's inauguration, Papadopoulos was questioned by FBI agents about his contacts with Russians and other foreign nationals. In February, Papadopoulos deleted his Facebook account. Then, on July 27, 2017, after returning from an extended trip abroad, Papadopoulos was arrested at Dulles Airport and charged with lying to the FBI about the timing and significance of his relationship with Mifsud and with obstructing justice for having deleted his Facebook account, the latter offense carrying a potential 20-year sentence. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of lying.\n\nThese are the core, agreed-upon facts. When the news of Papadopoulos's guilty plea broke on Oct. 30, 2017, the most common theory of the case, based on news reports at the time, was that Papadopoulos, a little-known Trump campaign adviser, had been coordinating with a Kremlin asset, Mifsud. With time, that softened into a theory that a foolish young man had been courted by a shadowy Kremlin operative and then lied about it. But there is also a Papadopoulos version of the story. In that account, Papadopoulos is approached by spies tied to the U.S., British, Israeli and Australian governments for the purpose (depending upon the spy) of either foiling his anti-Turkey recommendations or sabotaging Donald Trump's campaign. His meetings with Mifsud and Downer were part of a larger setup.\n\n\"This was not a Russian operation. This was a British-Australian operation,\" he says. \"The Israelis helped.\" Papadopoulos, in short, is offering a conspiracy theory. This in itself doesn't make him wrong. Sometimes, after all, the existence of a conspiracy is certain, and solving the mysteries surrounding it must involve theory. Sometimes, the existence of a conspiracy is uncertain but still worth investigating. What, after all, was the idea that Trump and Putin had coordinated with WikiLeaks to steal the 2016 election if not a theory of conspiracy? In the case of Papadopoulos, it seemed certain that conspirators of some sort had entangled him in their web. On that much, both liberals and conservatives could agree.\n\nSimona Mangiante Papadopoulos, an Italian lawyer who married George in March 2018, often fights with Russiagate obsessives on Twitter.\n\nSimona Mangiante Papadopoulos is a stylish Italian lawyer who a multitude of Americans, at least those with prolonged MSNBC exposure, seem to believe is a Russian spy. Simona and George moved from Chicago to Southern California in September 2018, when Simona landed a small movie role. Within a few weeks, their life became almost as surreal as George's had been in 2016. They befriended comedian and actor Tom Arnold, ex-husband of Roseanne Barr, even though he is so hostile to Trump that he once got a visit from the Secret Service for a tweet offering to fight with the president. They also signed up for a multi-episode documentary about their lives, meaning that a production crew was frequently tailing them. For me, this created a friendly game of cat and mouse, since I wanted to chronicle the crew filming, while the crew preferred to film me chronicling. (We wound up staying mostly separate.)\n\nSimona, meanwhile, was leading a Twitter life punctuated by fights with Russiagate obsessives, random trolls and sometimes her own mother-in-law. She has a terrible relationship with George's family, and when I first interviewed her and George together, I deemed the subject touchy enough that I decided to postpone mention of it to a subsequent trip. She brought it up in 20 minutes. \"I left everything behind and gave unconditional support to my husband,\" she said. \"The least I expect is a neutral attitude.\"\n\nThe three of us met for dinner at Simona's favorite Italian place, Via Alloro, in Beverly Hills. Simona, who has striking green eyes and blond (though naturally brownish) hair, wore a white knit dress with a black belt and thigh-high tan suede boots. Her lipstick was crimson. Her speech, already accented, can get so rapid when she's worked up that the documentary crew has discussed using subtitles.\n\nSimona was born in 1981 and grew up in Caserta, Italy, near Naples. She earned a law degree in 2005 and spent several years in a variety of internships and legal jobs before taking a post with the European Parliament, where she worked for seven years. In the fall of 2016, she moved to London and found a job at LCILP, working with Joseph Mifsud. This is how George came into her life. Although he had left LCILP half a year earlier, he had noticed Simona's picture on the website and sent her a flirtatious message. They stayed in touch.\n\nAfter three months, Simona left LCILP and hung up her own shingle, specializing in law related to international child abduction. In April 2017, when she took a trip to New York to visit her aunt, George showed up at the airport, and this first meeting led to a passionate attraction. They met several times more over the following months, vacationing on Mykonos and Capri and visiting Simona's parents in Caserta. She was still living in London when George went dark one day and stopped responding to messages or calls. Only a few days later, when he sent Simona a message from his mother's Facebook account, did she find out that he had been arrested.\n\nSimona flew to Chicago, where George was living with his mother. It was 15 days after George's arrest, and she saw a frightened man. They spent three weeks together. On a subsequent trip to Chicago, she received a subpoena from Robert Mueller and underwent a multi-hour FBI interrogation. During the year that followed, she kept coming back, and her savings ran out. \"I realized I really cared about him,\" she said.\n\nOn Simona's third trip to Chicago, in December 2017, George proposed marriage, getting down on one knee in his room in his mother's house. On March 2, 2018, they were married at City Hall. No one from George's family attended. The only guests were then-ABC News journalists Rhonda Schwartz and Brian Ross, who later did a segment on the wedding. In smoother times a few months earlier, George's mother had given Simona a family ring, a large emerald surrounded by diamonds. Simona held up her hand to show it to me. Remembering this gift, she seemed to soften toward her in-law. \"This situation makes everybody crazy,\" she said.\n\nBecause Simona and George live in an unusual sort of isolation, with many invitations to Hollywood events as novelty guests but with few close friends, they have developed an unlikely circle of intimates. Among them is the documentary team. FGW Productions, headed by producer Stephanie Frederic, recently did a six-part A&E documentary on the murder of Tupac Shakur, but Frederic has observed that Simona and George, who are prone to intense changes of mind and mood, make that one seem easy.\n\nSimona and George are technically unpaid for participation, but FGW compensates them for other things, like family photographs and incidentals. The first extended period the group spent together was during the days immediately before George's departure for prison in Oxford, Wis. For Simona, who was in tears for much of her time in Wisconsin, the film crew was a comfort in the storm, and after George's release, the couple grew closer and closer to Frederic, even staying at her apartment for several weeks. \"I find myself being part therapist, part producer,\" says Frederic. This may understate her role. For a while, she was advising them on media inquiries, too, and the documentary team even helped find George and Simona their apartment in Beachwood Canyon. This raises obvious questions about the effect of observer on the observed, but Frederic said she never looks to create situations for their own sake in the manner of reality TV.\n\nIf Frederic has become an improbable surrogate mother, Tom Arnold has become an improbable surrogate father. We met at one of his haunts, Soho House West Hollywood. Arnold was sipping honey tea to battle a bout of laryngitis, but he relished talking about Simona and George, frequently dissolving into high-pitched chuckles.\n\nThe three had met on Beverly Drive, he said, when Arnold was out walking with his kids. George had called out \"Tom Arnold!\" and introduced himself. An exchange of numbers led to an invitation from Arnold to meet him at Soho House. George showed up first. \"He started telling his story, and I started taking some notes,\" said Arnold. \"Then she comes out, and the world lights up.\" The three have been friends ever since. As Arnold sees it, George is a good kid who got in over his head. Fringe rightists, he believes, have seduced him into a narrative that elevates his importance even as it absolves him of guilt. \"They want George to be their conspiracy monkey,\" he said.\n\nIf the friendship with Arnold was improbable, it may also have been inevitable. Arnold seems to have crossed paths with everyone, including, to his displeasure, Trump. Arnold sees George and Simona as incompetent spies in an unlikely love story, and he has since become an informal therapist to the couple. \"I said to them, 'I was in a famous marriage,'\u2009\" he said, referring to his long-ago union with Barr. \"I'm also a writer and a storyteller. People will tell bits and pieces of your story. But you're the ones who get to tell your whole story.\"\n\nAs the weeks went by, I contacted many former Papadopoulos acquaintances in government, think tanks and the private sector in the United States, Israel, Cyprus, Egypt and Greece. Those who spoke to me offered similar impressions: Papadopoulos was an agreeable young man who'd often worked alongside Hudson Institute fellow Seth Cropsey. But most offered no response. Cropsey ignored multiple emails and eventually passed me on to the Hudson Institute press office, which offered careful and uninteresting replies. (I contacted nearly everyone mentioned in this article, but many declined to answer or to comment on the record.)\n\nI next saw George and Simona in late January, a day after Simona's birthday, when the couple were to be photographed for this article. The shoot was at their apartment, a small 1920s duplex on a leafy thoroughfare north of Franklin Boulevard. When I arrived, Simona was sitting on a stool getting makeup applied, while George, dressed in a dark cotton sweater and jeans, brewed espresso in a red Bialetti pot on a burner in the kitchen.\n\nThe downstairs of their home consisted of one 12-by-18-foot main room, an adjacent kitchen and a walled patio. Squeezed into these spaces were a dozen of us: George and Simona, the makeup artist, a photographer and two assistants, three members of the documentary crew, a decorator, myself and Travis Barker, the decorator's Yorkshire terrier.\n\nIf the hosts felt bothered by such an intrusion, they didn't show it. They were happy that their apartment had been made habitable at all. The decorator, whom FGW had hired for the occasion, had stretched a budget of $3,000 and filled up the place. The living room now had a blue-and-white Persian-themed area rug, a blue couch, a round faux-marble-top coffee table, a tea-light candelabrum, an unframed modern painting on the wall, and fake flowers and assorted knickknacks on the fireplace mantel and the built-in shelves.\n\nThere was a knock on the front door. \"I brought your suits,\" said Tom Arnold, walking in with clothes on a hanger. George and Simona, grinning and surprised, hurried over to him. The documentary crew hurried over, too. \"Happy birthday, happy birthday,\" he told Simona. \"Is your mother-in-law -- I saw them removing a dumpster -- is she in pieces in there?\"\n\nAfter the shoot, the couple got ready for a party at the Italian Cultural Institute in Westwood. I gave them a ride there, and since they were famished, we swung by In-N-Out Burger. As we waited in the drive-through line, George said he was no longer running for Congress but focusing instead on his role on the advisory board of C3\u00ae International, a medical cannabis start-up that he hoped would help stem the opioid crisis. Simona said she was proud of her husband for his career and for his onward march. \"Thank you, my love,\" he said. \"We were resilient, Simona. Many people would not be resilient. They would just give up.\"\n\nTom Arnold relished talking about Simona and George, frequently dissolving into high-pitched chuckles.\n\nConspiratorial stories can be reasonable or insane, but most have the same trigger: a glitch in the narrative, something in the official explanation that doesn't make sense. In the case of George Papadopoulos, that glitch is Joseph Mifsud.\n\nThe New York Times has called Mifsud \"an enthusiastic promoter of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\" Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have labeled him a \"Kremlin-linked\" \"cutout.\" Documents later produced by Mueller and his team suggested that, if not for Papadopoulos's lies, investigators might have elected to \"challenge the Professor or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States.\"\n\nBut Mifsud worked in high government circles in Europe, and no action taken by investigators suggests that they viewed him as a serious threat. Until the Papadopoulos indictment went public, Mifsud appears to have lived a normal and unencumbered life, attending conferences and meeting with Western government officials. Stephan Roh, a Zurich-based lawyer who communicates with the media on Mifsud's behalf, maintains that Mifsud \"is not a Russian spy but a Western intelligence co-operator.\"\n\nMifsud went into hiding days after Papadopoulos's plea became public, and his disappearance leaves rabbit holes that threaten to swallow even the most cautious explorer. But we can say this much: If he was Kremlin-linked, then he managed to infiltrate a lot of European and possibly American institutions, and it's strange that there hasn't been an outcry or investigations into the breach. On the other hand, if he was part of Western intelligence, then, as Republican congressman Jim Jordan told Fox News, \"that changes it all.\"\n\nGeorge and Simona depend more than most people on the help of new friends. Simona's outreach can resemble that of a panicked swimmer. George relies more on warmth, flattery and a Zelig-like adaptability to his audience. When the organizer of the Hollywood Beauty Awards, to which he'd been invited, called him as we walked to a cafe, it sounded at times as if he were speaking to Florence Nightingale. \"It's a great cause,\" he said. \"It's people like you who are changing the world one step at a time.\"\n\nFor all his low-level fawning, Papadopoulos never asked me for favors and only rarely went off the record. Sometimes, I would remind him that I was recording. Once or twice, out of compassion, I felt compelled to offer him a chance to walk back a jejune statement. He never did.\n\nHis most reflective moment came during an interview in a dreary bakery area at Gelson's, an upscale supermarket chain. He admitted that participating in a documentary, which would expose many embarrassing things, was risky. \"Sometimes I don't understand why I'm doing it,\" he said. He talked about growing up in suburban Chicago, experiencing his parents' divorce and being separated from his mother. He's estranged from his brother, and relations with his mother seem to be loving but rocky. He'd told me earlier that he hadn't seen his father in nearly two years. \"I think of the situation as part of the collateral damage,\" he said. \"I don't justify his behavior at all. I would never abandon my son, basically, in the middle of a crisis, like he has.\"\n\nWhy, I asked, had he been so hungry for early success? He grew thoughtful. \"I looked up to my father,\" he said. \"I loved that he was a doctor and very successful. I always said to myself, 'When I have children someday, hopefully, I want them to revere me that way too.'\u2009\"\n\n\"I guess a bit of it was having a chip on my shoulder, not following the medical path, and viewing politics as the most prestigious role you could possibly have in the world,\" he mused. \"I mean, at 25, I could sit in a meeting one-on-one like I am with you with a foreign minister of a foreign country. ... And for me there was something exhilarating in it. It made my blood rush. It was a thrill. I would just tell my dad: You're rich. I love that. You have a beautiful home. But what's your thrill?\"\n\nComedian and actor Tom Arnold has become an informal therapist to the Papadopouloses.\n\nAs anyone who has spent any time in the Twitterverse knows, it's a warped space that can feel like a gauge of public sentiment even as it distorts it. In the case of Simona, a faction of Twitter seems to believe that she is on a long-term Kremlin mission connected to Joseph Mifsud. This notion went into overdrive when she was caught in an acknowledged deception: sending ABC News a photo of her passport that altered her birth date by three years. (She says she wanted to pass as younger in Hollywood.) British blogger and former member of Parliament Louise Mensch, who is notorious for seeing a Russian hand in everything from Islamic State terrorism in Istanbul to the 2012 death of Andrew Breitbart, is one of her most ardent attackers.\n\nHoping that my reporting would help beat back this tide, Simona provided me with contacts for family, friends and former colleagues. I spoke to her mother, Carolina Cicatelli, who sent me a dozen photographs showing Simona at various ages in settings that were obviously Italian. Italian socialist Gianni Pittella, a former vice president of the European Parliament, said he'd known Simona's family for years and described her as \"loyal and a very, very good person.\" (Pittella, as it happens, is also a friend of Joseph Mifsud's and introduced Simona to him.) Old friends told me stories that matched up, and no one disputed that she'd worked for the European Parliament for seven years. I did see from her Internet pursuers that she had changed her LinkedIn profile in small ways and tweeted out and deleted documents related to her employment; still, to jump to espionage (as opposed to unemployment or breakups or moves) as the explanation made about as much sense as jumping to tuberculosis as the reason for a cough.\n\nGeorge, by contrast, was proving more troublesome. He had been quick to pull up articles he'd written with Cropsey (claiming to have done most or all of the writing) and a photo of himself and Cropsey in a meeting with the president of Cyprus, to prove that he had played a crucial role at the Hudson Institute. But I was still waiting to see emails backing up other claims about his career there.\n\nI spoke to George's mother, Kiki Papadopoulos. She painted a vivid picture of the toll taken by an FBI investigation. But she also told me that her ex-husband, rather than abandoning his son as George had claimed, had been supportive during George's ordeal and had paid his legal bills.\n\nInext saw the Papadopouloses on the evening before Valentine's Day, and George was especially upbeat. Days earlier, Republican congressman Mark Meadows had called for declassifying the files on Russiagate. \"Let's start with the docs on George Papadopoulos,\" Meadows tweeted, adding that \"I know, and the FBI knows, that Papadopoulos was not part of any collusion.\"\n\nGeorge and Simona had asked to dine at Crustacean, an haute-Vietnamese fusion restaurant in Beverly Hills. \"What do you think,\" George asked the waiter, \"the crab or the lobster?\"\n\n\"The crab is what we're world-famous for,\" the waiter said.\n\nI remembered, with expense-account dread, that the crab cost $72.\n\n\"Let's do two of those crabs,\" said George.\n\nI asked him about a tweet he'd sent the day before: \"Trust the plan.\" I'd been astonished to see him trot out a signature phrase among adherents of a conspiracy theory called QAnon, centered on an anonymous Web poster called \"Q\" who claims to be a government official working with Trump on a master plan to expose a corrupt deep state.\n\nPapadopoulos said the tweet had been inspired by a Drake song, \"God's Plan,\" and had nothing to do with conspiracy. \"All of a sudden, I have 10,000 likes,\" he said, breaking into laughter. \"And all these people are like, 'You're making me cry. You have no idea how emotional I am that you're Q.'\u2009\"\n\nOn the drive home, as we discussed how many of Papadopoulos's former contacts had minimized their ties to him, I reminded him of how important old emails would be to bolster his version of events. \"I have them, all of them,\" he said. Simona, sitting in back, hadn't made a sound, and I turned around to see if she'd fallen asleep. No, she'd been fighting on Twitter with Louise Mensch.\n\nThe next morning, Los Angeles was deluged in rain. I arrived at the Papadopoulos apartment to drive us to a production meeting with FGW. Simona, wearing a white blazer, jeans and her above-the-knee suede boots, seemed out of sorts, and as she prepared the Bialetti pot for coffee, she told me she'd slept poorly. The Twitter battle with Mensch had expanded into a marital battle. George had retweeted Mensch when she plugged his book, but he had stayed quiet when Mensch hurled Russian-spy allegations at Simona.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed by him, actually, more than Louise,\" Simona said. \"She's playing a game, right? She's telling George, 'I'm interested in your book. Your wife is a Russian agent.' It would be simple and elegant to say, 'Thanks for being interested in my book, but read the record about my wife's background.'\u2009\"\n\nAs Simona continued in this vein, George walked in, his face pinkish from a shower and puffy from recent sleep. \"And my logic is very simple,\" he said. \"Me shouting to the world that my wife is not a Russian spy puts much more attention on her, mocks her, and it mocks -- \"\n\n\"No, no George, this is an easy way to dismiss -- \"\n\nThey began to talk over each other. \"You have to be a man,\" said Simona. \"Grow some man qualities, and face people who insult me and bully me. You can't do that? This is the door, you can go.\"\n\nI looked at the clock and suggested we skip coffee. We headed into the rain, and George and Simona, still fighting, shared a children's umbrella with cat ears. Traffic was slow in the downpour, and there was going to be no change of subject. I asked if social media was a frequent source of their disputes.\n\n\"This is very typical from her,\" said George, unhelpfully.\n\n\"From her, because of your behavior,\" said Simona.\n\n\"I don't need to go to every single person on Twitter and say don't say that about my wife. You're talking like a 5-year-old.\"\n\n\"George, you're talking like a little traitor with no balls. That's what you're talking about. That's what you are, actually.\"\n\nBy the time I pulled up to Simona's destination, the two had agreed to divorce.\n\n\"It's really sad, actually. I feel really disgusted by you,\" Simona said, opening the door and planting a suede boot in a large puddle.\n\nIliked George and Simona. I could see why Tom Arnold had told me that they were meant for each other. They seemed to fight and make up daily. A few hours after their morning clash, when George noticed a bleeding hangnail, Simona reacted as if he'd been wounded by a sword. For all their troubles, they took pleasure in life and savored new experiences. My theory of Simona was that she was an intelligent but temperamental person who was in love with George. But my theory of George was more unsettled.\n\nDuring our first meeting, he had told me he'd had $35,000 in the bank when he was arrested. At a subsequent meeting, he said it was $25,000. He had claimed not to have seen his father for almost two years, but his sentencing statement noted his parents being in the courtroom. When I mentioned learning that his father had paid his legal bills, he said that his father had helped him only after making him exhaust his savings.\n\nWhen I spoke on the phone to George's father, Antonios Papadopoulos, he called George's claim of having to drain his savings a \"100 percent lie.\" \"George had no savings that I'm aware of,\" Antonios said. \"I paid for everything, including his transportation back and forth to the court and the $9,500 fine.\" As for the family's relations with Simona, he would say only that \"I see Simona's involvement in George's life entirely differently from the way George sees it.\"\n\nA few days later, I spoke to C3\u00ae International CEO Steele Smith. Papadopoulos had said he was being paid $100,000 a year to sit on the company's advisory board. But Smith characterized Papadopoulos as a \"minor shareholder\" and said the position was unpaid. (Papadopoulos later forwarded me a proposal from the company that laid out the payment terms as he had described them. Smith said the proposal was not current.)\n\nI spoke to a British barrister named Arvinder Sambei, who had worked with LCILP until early 2017. Papadopoulos had identified her as a lawyer for the FBI who had arranged for him to meet Joseph Mifsud in Italy. \"I'm completely taken aback,\" she said, adding that she had encountered Papadopoulos only once, when she was making tea, and that she had never been engaged as counsel by the FBI. Rather, as a former senior prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, she had sometimes worked with the FBI's Office of International Affairs.\n\nBy the time I reached a U.S.-Israeli businessman whom Papadopoulos now accuses of being part of a sting operation against him overseen by the FBI -- supposedly in a failed effort to make Papadopoulos look like a spy for Israel and give them a reason to arrest him -- I doubted I would be speaking to a secret agent. His name is Charles Tawil, and he forwarded me numerous emails and messages contradicting Papadopoulos's timeline and claims. Papadopoulos has alleged that Tawil gave him $10,000 in marked bills (which he now says Congress wants to examine) and that he took it out of fear. But Tawil says that Papadopoulos himself requested the money. It was an advance on a consulting deal that had fallen through because of an inappropriate email Papadopoulos had later sent the client.\n\nTawil forwarded me that email, from mid-June 2017, as well as messages sent several weeks later, in which Papadopoulos wrote that he had been offered a job in Brussels but turned it down. \"Of course I prefer working with you than to some job in the eu commission, but need to know that we are still working together you and I on the deals and with retainer monthly,\" he wrote. Tawil, who is bitter that Papadopoulos never returned the money and accused Tawil of being a secret agent, told me he now assumes that Papadopoulos was lying about everything.\n\nIhad pressed Papadopoulos on providing corroborating documents, saying this was key to his credibility. He said he was locked out of his old email accounts but finally texted me that his ghostwriter on \"Deep State Target\" had a paper archive of his emails that I could pick up in New York. I got the writer to send them, and five days later I received a binder that included hundreds of emails -- with only occasional redactions -- between Papadopoulos and the Trump-related people in his life during 2016 and 2017. Papadopoulos had been evasive about providing written evidence, but this was a remarkable gesture of transparency, and he placed no conditions on my use of the collection.\n\nI was struck to see a number of Papadopoulos's statements verified. Yes, he had helped engineer a meeting, through an Egyptian embassy official, between Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi. Yes, he had offered input on Trump's foreign policy speech in late April 2016. Yes, there was an email from Theresa May's office asking Papadopoulos to pass on official congratulations to Trump.\n\nAt the same time, however, the collection undermined many claims that he has made. Some examples: \"Deep State Target\" describes a cryptic conversation with a Belarusan American businessman named Sergei Millian in January 2017 that Papadopoulos characterizes as \"the last I hear from him. Ever.\" But in reality Millian kept emailing Papadopoulos, getting no reply, for months afterward. The book claims that Trump headquarters informed him of an interview request from Russian news service Interfax and gave him instructions about what to say, complimenting him afterward. In reality, Interfax contacted Papadopoulos directly, and though the campaign okayed the interview, the feedback afterward apparently wasn't positive. Papadopoulos wrote to campaign official Michael Glassner to ask if he was, as others had told him, \"off the campaign because of an interview I gave.\"\n\nPapadopoulos seems to have met a number of foreign officials by suggesting that he had a close connection to Trump. Then he would write to the campaign about these meetings and suggest he had a close connection to foreign officials. (This included the untrue claim to have met the Russian ambassador to London.) At no point -- apart from Clovis's \"Great work\" -- does anyone in the campaign seem to encourage his outreach to Moscow.\n\nI had been through many potential narratives of Papadopoulos, but now a simple one was starting to emerge: that an ambitious young man with a strong desire to impress people had most likely embellished his way into a world of trouble, relaying common rumors (e.g., that the Russians had damaging information about Hillary Clinton) as firsthand information to people like Alexander Downer. If this theory was true, then Papadopoulos's story wasn't about how a vital campaign operative fell into traps laid by deep-state conspirators. It was about how, in a time of Trump-Russia hysteria, a minor player could set off global earthquakes because he wanted to look big.\n\nAn uncomfortable list of inconsistencies had to be discussed, and I flew down to Los Angeles in March to ask Papadopoulos about them in person. \"Deep State Target\" had been released a few days earlier, and George, sometimes accompanied by Simona, had been appearing on cable news nonstop. When I stepped into the apartment in Beachwood Canyon, I could see that the two of them were exhausted.\n\nI caught up first with Simona, who had made a voluntary closed-door appearance before Senate investigators. Among the questions she'd been asked was why George said he'd never met with a Russian yet had boasted in emails that he'd met several Russians, including the ambassador to Britain. \"You know what I said: Knowing George he was bulls -- -ing,\" Simona said with a laugh. \"He was just trying to impress somebody.\" After about an hour, she went upstairs to take a nap, and George and I seated ourselves on the tiny Spanish-tiled patio to go over remaining questions.\n\nSince Papadopoulos had implied to an interviewer that he'd broken off relations with Charles Tawil in June 2017, why, I asked, had he messaged Tawil weeks later, to say he had turned down a job in Brussels to keep working with him? \"That was me trying to get him away from me,\" Papadopoulos answered. \"Me telling him I have a new job is polite for 'Leave me alone.'\u2009\"\n\nBut didn't he tell Tawil he'd turned down the job? \"Well, because I had his money in my pocket. I'm trying to say, 'Hey, man, I still have your money. I'm trying to get away from you, but you know I have a liability here in my hand.'\u2009\"\n\nWhy had he told Congress that the FBI had said when arresting him, \"This is what happens when you don't tell us everything about your Russia contacts,\" but had written in his book that an FBI agent had told him, \"This is what happens when you work for Trump\"?\n\n\"There was an agent who made that remark, okay? This is in the middle of seven agents swarming me, and a chaotic moment. But because I can't remember who exactly said that comment, that's why I wasn't telling Congress that.\"\n\nWe spent an hour in this manner. But the ordeal seemed to bother me more than Papadopoulos. As the three of us drove to dinner afterward, the conversation was cheerful as ever. This time, I'd chosen the restaurant: Yamashiro, a Japanese-themed place with an expansive view of the city. \"Wow, look how beautiful this is,\" George said as we pulled up. \"This is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. This is amazing.\"\n\nSimona and George seemed to fight and make up daily. But for all their troubles, they took pleasure in life and savored new experiences.\n\nRobert Mueller's \"Report on the Investigation Into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election\" was released in April. It raised questions about obstruction of justice but closed the door on theories of conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. Overall, it has been a helpful development for Papadopoulos. The report has confirmed his claim that he was investigated for his ties to Israel. A subsequent story in the New York Times bore out his claim that Azra Turk, a young woman who allegedly posed as a flirtatious assistant to FBI informant Stefan Halper, was yet another spy (or, in Times parlance, \"cloaked investigator\") sent by the U.S. government. Such revelations, coming in the wake of other news reports calling into question the propriety of FBI behavior toward the Trump campaign, have led a growing number of people to buy into Papadopoulos's story as a whole. On May 3, even Donald Trump weighed in, tweeting out Papadopoulos's claim to Sean Hannity that \"this whole thing was a complete setup.\" But I also saw on social media that close observers of his case, often on the right, were raising questions about contradictions in his stories.\n\nDuring my final dinner with George and Simona, we talked about Los Angeles and winter rains and Italian intelligence agencies. Afterward, we walked out to a garden overlooking nighttime Los Angeles, glittering to the sea. I took a few pictures, including one of a happy Simona planting a kiss on George's cheek. \"This was so fun,\" George said. I was reminded of what Stephanie Frederic had told one of the people she recruited for her Papadopoulos documentary: \"You're going to like them.\"\n\nWhen I dropped them off at home, we exchanged hugs. George told me that I'd become a friend and that having me reporting on them had been a special experience. \"Yes,\" Simona said. \"You taught us -- many things.\"\n\nBut I could say that they had taught me things, too, or at least made them clear. The more a given narrative means to us, the harder it is to abandon, even if the facts don't support it. That's true of those on the left who continue to see Trump-Russia collusion -- and it's true of those on the right who, despite the inconsistencies in Papadopoulos's story, have begun to champion it.\n\nPerhaps more than anything, what unites the combatants in America's cold civil war is a need for heroes and villains who can keep us entertained. Whatever you think of George and Simona, they are great characters, and you can cast them as good guys or bad guys with equal ease, depending on your agenda. Maybe that's why they've had such a fruitful transition from the world of politics to the world of Hollywood -- if you can call that a transition at all.\n\nT.A.

But There's Scant Evidence It Works.", "body": "\"There is very little data to justify how these drugs are being used and why they should be in the top 10 in sales,\" a researcher said.\n\nOne of the most widely prescribed prescription drugs, gabapentin, is being taken by millions of patients despite little or no evidence that it can relieve their pain.\n\nIn 2006, I wrote about gabapentin after discovering accidentally that it could counter hot flashes.\n\nThe drug was initially approved 25 years ago to treat seizure disorders, but it is now commonly prescribed off-label to treat all kinds of pain, acute and chronic, in addition to hot flashes, chronic cough and a host of other medical problems.\n\nThe F.D.A. approves a drug for specific uses and doses if the company demonstrates it is safe and effective for its intended uses, and its benefits outweigh any potential risks. Off-label means that a medical provider can legally prescribe any drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for any condition, not just the ones for which it was approved. This can leave patients at the mercy of what their doctors think is helpful.\n\nThus, it can become a patient's job to try to determine whether a medication prescribed off-label is both safe and effective for their particular condition. This is no easy task even for well-educated doctors, let alone for desperate patients in pain.\n\nTwo doctors recently reviewed published evidence for the benefits and risks of off-label use of gabapentin (originally sold under the trade name Neurontin) and its brand-name cousin Lyrica (pregabalin) for treating all kinds of pain.\n\n(There is now also a third drug, gabapentin encarbil, sold as Horizant, approved only for restless leg syndrome and postherpetic neuralgia, which can follow a shingles outbreak.)\n\nThe reviewers, Dr. Christopher W. Goodman and Allan S. Brett of the University of South Carolina School of Medicine, found the drugs, called gabapentinoids, wanting in most cases for which they are currently being prescribed.\n\nAs Dr. Goodman said in an interview, \"There is very little data to justify how these drugs are being used and why they should be in the top 10 in sales. Patients and physicians should understand that the drugs have limited evidence to support their use for many conditions, and there can be some harmful side effects, like somnolence, dizziness and difficulty walking.\" Furthermore, for patients prone to substance use disorders, like an opioid addiction, the gabapentinoids, although they are not opioids, are potentially addictive, he said.\n\nThe gabapentinoids are symbolic of three currently challenging problems in the practice of medicine: a deadly national epidemic of opioid addiction prompting doctors to seek alternative drugs for pain; the limited training in pain management received by most doctors; and the influence of aggressive and sometimes illegal promotion of prescription drugs, including through direct-to-consumer advertising.\n\nGabapentin and Lyrica, both sold by Pfizer, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat only four debilitating pain problems: postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia and spinal cord injury. Even for these approved uses, the evidence for relief offered by the drugs is hardly dramatic, Drs. Goodman and Brett reported in JAMA Internal Medicine online.\n\nIn many well-controlled studies they found there was less than a one-point difference on the 10-point pain scale between patients taking the drug versus a placebo, a difference often clinically meaningless. For example, among 209 patients with sciatica, Lyrica did not significantly reduce the intensity of leg pain when compared with a placebo, and dizziness was more commonly reported by the 108 patients who took the drug.\n\nBut when patients complain of pain related to conditions ranging from sciatica and osteoarthritis to foot pain and migraine, clinicians often reach for the prescription pad and order either gabapentin or the more costly Lyrica.\n\nFollowing the approval of Neurontin, its producer at the time, Warner-Lambert, engaged in what the government determined was an illegal marketing campaign that resulted in sales exceeding $2 billion a year before its patent expired in 2004. Still, the campaign succeeded in bringing gabapentin to the attention of many doctors who treat patients with persistent life-disrupting pain.\n\nIt's not that there are no other alternatives to opioids to treat chronic pain, among them physical therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnosis and mindfulness training. But practicing clinicians may be unaware of the options, most of which require more effort for the doctor than writing a drug prescription and are not as easy or accessible for patients as swallowing a pill.\n\nAs Dr. Michael E. Johansen, a family doctor in Columbus, Ohio, put it, \"I use gabapentin clinically and try to stay close to the approved indications, but occasionally we run out of options when faced with patients who hurt. It's rare that these drugs eliminate pain, and I don't tell patients their pain will go away. If there's any benefit, it's probably marginal.\"\n\nDespite the limited evidence of benefit, in a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in February, Dr. Johansen found that the number of people taking gabapentinoids more than tripled from 2002 to 2015, with more than four in five taking the inexpensive generic, gabapentin.\n\nIn 2016, 64 million prescriptions for gabapentin were dispensed, up from 39 million in 2012, Drs. Goodman and Brett reported in The New England Journal of Medicine. They believe that the opioid epidemic partly fueled this increase. \"While working in inpatient and outpatient settings,\" they wrote, \"we have observed that clinicians are increasingly prescribing gabapentin and pregabalin for almost any type of pain.\"\n\nDr. Johansen cited several serious concerns about overuse of gabapentinoids, including \"a dearth of long-term safety data, small effect sizes, concern for increased risk of overdose in combination with opioid use, and high rates of off-label prescribing, which are associated with high rates of adverse effects.\"\n\nContributing to the frequent misuse of gabapentinoids is how doctors interpret the term \"neuropathic pain\" for which the drugs are commonly prescribed. It is defined as pain caused by a lesion or disease of the nervous system, leading clinicians to assume that if a drug is effective for one type of neuropathic pain, it is effective for all types, regardless of the underlying cause, Drs. Goodman and Brett suggested.\n\nDr. Johansen pointed out that \"there is no recipe book\" for treating pain with gabapentinoids. \"Doctors need to work with one patient at a time and figure out what works and what doesn't work,\" he said. He noted that many times pain resolves with \"the tincture of time\" but patients and doctors may attribute improvement to the prescribed drug. For those taking a gabapentinoid, he suggested that patients' doctors readdress its use after two or three months.\n\nBut Dr. Goodman cautioned against going off the drug cold turkey because there can be unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jane_e_brody@nytimes.com", "name": "Jane E.

Roy Blunt (D-Mo.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) discuss mental heath at a Washington Post Live event.\n\nActress Glenn Close still remembers vividly the dramatic and troubling scene when her nephew, Calen, had a psychotic break as a 17-year-old living in Montana.\n\n\"He had to be put in a straitjacket and driven two hours to the closest place where he could get help,\" Close said at a Washington Post Live event yesterday.\n\nThe lack of accessible help for Calen -- and that he had to go to the emergency room instead of getting treatment prior -- is part of the reason she's asking Congress to expand and extend funding for mental health care through a pilot program scheduled to expire on July 1.\n\nClose became a mental health advocate after encountering serious illness within her own family -- not just Calen, who has schizophrenia, but also her sister Jessie, diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychotic tendencies.\n\nShe's backing a program approved five years ago under a bill from Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), which the senators are now trying to expand from eight states to 19 states for another two years. The bill gives extra Medicaid dollars to community clinics in return for providing a wide range of mental health services. Its aim is to correct a shortcoming in the country's health-care system, which often prioritizes care for physical ailments but not for mental conditions such as depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder.\n\nUnder the pilot, more than 350 health clinics serving a quarter-million Medicaid patients have been able to get fully reimbursed by the federal government for the full range of mental health care. If funding isn't extended, the centers may have to lay off 3,000 newly hired staff, cut off medication-assisted treatment to 9,000 patients and reestablish wait lists for mental health services, according to estimates provided by the senators' offices.\n\n\"We have seen psychiatric crisis services, 24-hour services, start up in the community,\" Stabenow said. \"So, someone's not going to the jail, someone's not sitting in emergency room for hours or maybe days trying to get help, and it's transforming those communities.\"\n\nDiagnoses of mental illness are on the rise in the United States, particularly among youth. Substance abuse, which often goes hand in hand with mental illness, has also spiked. Yet a large share of people don't get the help they need, due to a variety of reasons including stigma, insufficient insurance coverage and the unique nature of mental illness, which can discourage patients from seeking care independently.\n\nThat was the case for Close's sister and her nephew. She described her shock when Jessie confided in her that she couldn't stop thinking about killing herself.\n\n\"Our family had absolutely no vocabulary for mental health,\" Close said. \"We just -- we didn't really get it...I had no clue. She was very good at keeping what she was going through from all of us.\"\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimates that half of adults and teens with any mental illness and one-third of adults with serious mental illness don't get any kind of treatment. Blunt and Stabenow's bill tries to get at the problem by expanding mental health services covered via Medicaid, the government program for the low income which is also the single-largest payer of mental health services in the United States.\n\nTo be eligible for the increased Medicaid payments, a clinic must be certified as a Community Behavioral Health Clinic. That involves showing it provides a comprehensive set of services including 24-hour crisis counseling, substance abuse treatment and mental illness screenings. Part of the idea is to make treatment more readily available to patients before they end up in emergency rooms or in the criminal justice system.\n\n\"For the better part of 50 years the emergency room and law enforcement have been the de facto mental health delivery system in the country,\" Blunt said. \"And nobody is well served by that or satisfied by that.\"\n\nStabenow said she'll never forget when the sheriff in Cook County, Ill., told her he had just hired a psychiatrist as a jail director.\n\n\"He said, 'Well, it's real simple. Over half the people in my jail have mental health problems,' \" Stabenow recalled.\n\nThen there's the issue of stigma, a major reason people don't seek out help before their illnesses make it hard to function. Both Jessie and Calen found the stigma around their illnesses was \"just as painful\" as dealing with the illnesses themselves, Close said.\n\n\"Calen lost all his friends,\" Close said. \"Jessie felt that she was frightened to tell parents about her bipolar disorder because she was afraid they wouldn't allow their children to come and play with her young daughter at the time.\"\n\nThere are signs that the stigma is starting to thin, as more public figures share their own experiences. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), took to the Senate floor on Wednesday to share her struggle with depression that started in college and returned in her 30s. She described the experience as a \"spiral\" and called herself \"one of the lucky ones\" because she had insurance that allowed her to see a therapist.\n\n\"Down and down I went, until I could no longer see hope on the horizon,\" Smith said. \"Now, I was never suicidal, but I was struggling to function. I definitely wasn't living my best life; I really wasn't living at all. And that's the reality for mental illness for millions of Americans.\"\n\nBut talking more about mental illness has raised another concern among advocates: that it's possible to address the topic in unhelpful ways, ways that could even trigger people to act upon suicidal thoughts. The Netflix series \"13 Reasons Why\" recently came under scrutiny when a study purported to find a spike in youth suicides in the month after the show was released.\n\nClose called the series \"irresponsible.\"\n\n\"My sister went through suicide ideation,\" Close said. \"She tried to end her life twice. And I think you have to take responsibility because there's so much potential for impact with our social media. You really have to take responsibility for the stories that you tell.\"\n\nAHH: It took 18 days last fall for the University of Maryland to inform its students about the presence on campus of adenovirus. It's a virus that can appear with symptoms similar to a cold or flu but can be dangerous for people with weakened immune systems, making early detection critical.\n\nThe outbreak left one student, 18-year-old Olivia Shea Paregol, dead.\n\nMore than 40 students were sickened overall during the outbreak in November and December and 15 people were treated at hospitals, our Post colleagues Jenn Abelson, Amy Brittain and Sarah Larimer report in this investigation about the outbreak told through Olivia's story. The reporters spoke with more than 100 people during the course of their reporting to explain how the university's communication delay left the community in the dark.\n\nAfter learning of the virus's presence on campus, university officials \"discussed -- but decided against -- notifying students with compromised immune systems and residents living in Elkton Hall, according to records reviewed by The Washington Post,\" our colleagues write.\n\n\"Many parents and students have denounced the administration's handling of the viral outbreak and the mold infestation, complaining its actions endangered thousands of students, faculty and staff on campus,\" they add. \"In recent statements to The Post, university officials defended their actions ... They said they went beyond what was legally required to address the adenovirus outbreak and public health officials advised that it was not necessary to inform the public about the virus.\"\n\nOOF: Five states -- Virginia, Maryland, Kansas, Iowa and Wisconsin -- said they will sue opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma and members of the Sackler family that controls the company, for allegedly \"deceptively pushing powerful painkillers and misrepresenting the drugs' safety as the pills sparked the opioid crisis,\" our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports.\n\nThe five states join at least 40 others that have filed suits against companies that are in some way involved in the making, distributing and dispensing of opioid drugs. Another 1,600 counties, cities and Native American tribes have filed claims that have been consolidated in a massive federal lawsuit in Cleveland.\n\n\"All but Kansas targeted at least one member of the Sackler family, former president Richard Sackler, and Maryland named seven family members but not the company in an administrative filing,\" Lenny writes. \"In a news conference, West Virginia's attorney general, Patrick Morrisey said his state was seeking to hold both the company and Richard Sackler responsible for deaths and other harms from the worst drug epidemic in U.S. history.\"\n\n\"Even when it became apparent that thousands of people were dying of opioid abuse, Purdue doubled down by continuing its relentless and deceptive campaign\" to push physicians to prescribe OxyContin, Morrisey said at the news conference.\n\nOUCH: The Ebola outbreak is only getting worse in Congo, as is widespread fear among health workers trying to combat the outbreak. The death toll has reached 1,136 this week, and the number of infections rose to 1,632.\n\nMisinformation has driven distrust of those in medical uniforms, making some doctors battling what is the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history afraid to wear their scrubs, as our Post colleagues Danielle Paquette and Lena H. Sun report.\n\nThere have been 119 attacks this year against health workers, according to the World Health Organization, with 85 people wounded or killed.\n\n\"And the violence hampers the response effort in a more direct way: Ebola infections tend to spike after attacks, experts say, because emergency responders are forced to take cover and halt the distribution of immunity-boosting vaccinations,\" Danielle and Lena write. \"Concerns are growing that the crisis in Congo's North Kivu province could become as lethal as West Africa's battle against the hemorrhagic fever from 2013 to 2016, which killed 11,310 people across three countries.\"\n\n-- House Democrats passed legislation yesterday to lower prescription drug prices and to reverse some changes made by the Trump administration around the Affordable Care Act, a move that sets up the Democratic Party with yet another chance to tout a health-care message ahead of the 2020 election, our Post colleague Amy Goldstein reports.\n\nIn a 234-183 vote, five GOP members joined every Democrat in passing legislation to block rules from the Trump administration meant to encourage people to buy cheaper, short-term health plans that typically cover fewer services. The legislation also restores funding for advertising and other outreach to help people sign up for ACA marketplace plans. The package also includes three strategies to boost the availability of generic drugs, measures that initially had Republican support before Democrats packaged them with the measures to reinforce the ACA.\n\n\"The upshot was a barbed debate: Democrats accused Republicans of disregarding consumers' need for affordable, quality health care, and Republicans accused Democrats of thwarting a rare opportunity for bipartisanship,\" Amy writes.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) Pelosi also took a jab yesterday at the Senate, which is not planning to consider the legislation.\n\n\"I have some news for the distinguished leader in the Senate, the Republican leader,\" she said. \"The support for these bills is alive and well among the American people. He will be hearing from them because these bills are a matter of life and death and certainly quality of life for America's working families.\"\n\n-- Gilead Sciences CEO Daniel O'Day defended the high cost of the manufacturer's highly effective HIV treatment, Truvada, before a House committee yesterday.\n\n\"We have taken the disease from a death sentence to a manageable clinical condition, but we're not done yet,\" O'Day said. \"We have to be sure that Americans get our medicines at a price that allows us to invest in research.''\n\nDuring the hearing, lawmakers questioned the high cost of the drug and noted it was research conducted by governent scientists at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that helped develop Truvada, as our Post colleague Christopher Rowland reports.\n\n\"This treatment was developed as a result of investment made by the American taxpayers. The problem is that Gilead, the company that now sells the drug, charges astronomical prices,'' House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said. He pointed to how the price has shifted from $800 a month when it was introduced in 2004 to now about $2,000 a month. \"How can Gilead do this? How can our system allow a company to take a drug treatment that was developed with taxpayer funds and abuse its monopoly to charge such astronomical prices?''\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) asked O'Day why the drug's list price is nearly $2,000 in the United States when it's $8 in Australia.\n\n\"Truvada still has patent protection in the United States, and in the rest of the world it is generic,\" O'Day said. \"I can't comment on the price in Australia of the generic medicines, but it is generically available in other parts of the world and will be generically available in the United States as of September in 2020.\" Christopher notes that scheduled generic availability is set to slash the company's current earnings of $3 billion a year from the drug.\n\n-- House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he opposes the new Alabama law that effectively bans all abortions in the state, saying it \"goes further than I believe.\"\n\n\"I believe in exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother, and that's what I've voted on,\" McCarthy said at his weekly news conference, as our Post colleagues Felicia Sonmez and Mike DeBonis report. He said rape and incest exemptions are \"exactly what Republicans have voted on in this House.\"\n\nHis remarks came the day after Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) signed what is the country's strictest antiabortion law, outlawing abortions without any exceptions for rape or incest and which penalizes doctors who perform the procedure with up to 99 years in prison.\n\n\"Republicans are wary of a reprise of 2012, when they lost two key Senate races in Indiana and Missouri after the party's nominees in those states made comments about pregnancies resulting from rape,\" Felicia and Mike write. \"The debate over the Alabama law also comes at a time when Republicans are looking to make inroads with suburban women, a voting bloc that they lost when Democrats recaptured the House in 2018.\"\n\n-- Missouri's Republican-controlled Senate made the state the latest in a slew of states to pass strict antiabortion legislation. Republican lawmakers voted 24 to 10 to pass a bill to ban abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe bill is now headed to the state's Republican-controlled House, as our Post colleague Lindsey Bever reports. Republican Gov. Mike Parson has expressed support for the measure.\n\nParson tweeted before the bill's Senate vote:\n\nThe bill would penalize any doctor who performs the procedure with up to 15 years in prison. It includes no exceptions for rape or incest, and only allows women to get an abortion after the eighth week of pregnancy in cases of medical emergencies, which it defines as \"a condition which, based on reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert the death of the pregnant woman or for which a delay will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.\"\n\nIn a statement to The Post, M'Evie Mead, director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Missouri, said the GOP lawmakers \"are putting the health and lives of Missouri women at risk in their race to make our state the one that overturns Roe v. Wade at the Supreme Court.\"\n\nSen.

It was not immediately clear which states were targeting Richard Sackler, the former president of the company, as well as the company itself.\n\nIn a news conference, West Virginia's attorney general, Patrick Morriseysaid his state was seeking to hold both the company and Sacklers responsible for deaths and other harms from the worst drug epidemic in U.S. history.\n\n\"Even when it became apparent that thousands of people were dying of opioid abuse, Purdue doubled down by continuing its relentless and deceptive campaign\" to persuade doctors to write prescriptions for its powerful narcotic, OxyContin, Morrisey said.\n\nAt least thirty-six other states have sued companies involved in manufacturing, distributing and dispensing opioids. About 1,600 cities, counties, Native American tribes and others have also filed claims that have been consolidated in an enormous federal lawsuit in Cleveland.\n\nMorrisey said his state's lawsuit would be filed there, but some of the other states would join the large \"multidistrict litigation\" in Ohio.\n\nSpokesmen for Purdue and Sackler did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday morning.\n\nIn March, Purdue agreed to a $270 million out-of-court settlement with the state of Oklahoma, where the company faced its first trial on these issues at the end of May. Some of that money will be paid by members of the Sackler family.\n\nLast week, Purdue won a victory in state court when a North Dakota judge dismissed the state's lawsuit against Purdue.\n\nPurdue's president and chief executive, Craig Landau, said in March that declaring bankruptcy is an option the company might have to explore if jury verdicts or settlements become too costly.\n\nOverdoses caused by opioids are responsible for more than 400,000 deaths since 1999, with about half from prescription narcotics, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThursday's announcement came a day after New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art became the latest cultural institution to say it would no longer accept donations from members of the Sackler family, who are major philanthropists to art museums and educational institutions.\n\nThe legal actions add to the list of states seeking compensation for the deaths and damage from the two-decade old drug crisis that began after Purdue introduced its powerful painkiller, OxyContin, in 1996, and aggressively promoted the drug to physicians for a wide variety of aches and pains.\n\nIn documents released in February as part of its lawsuit, Massachusetts alleged that members of the Sackler family directed sales representatives to push extremely high doses of the drug.\n\nThe state's attorney general, Maura Healy accused the company of engaging in frequent acts of deception and misconduct to make as much money as possible, even as OxyContin launched the crisis and its toll of addiction and death. In a court filing responding to the lawsuit, lawyers for members of the Sackler family said Healey's lawsuit contains \"misleading and inflammatory allegations\" and takes internal company emails out of context.\n\nNew York also has targeted the Sackler family in its lawsuit.\n\nIn 2007, Purdue and three of its executives pleaded guilty to criminal charges of misleading doctors, regulators and the public about the dangers of the drug and collectively paid $635 million in fines.\n\nMorrisey noted that West Virginia had previously sued Purdue in 2001, recouping $10 million in a settlement with the company. But he said the state was legally entitled to pursue the company again because it had not changed its practices.\n\nHe promised to \"get as much as we possibly can for the state of West Virginia,\" which, he said, had suffered \"far too much senseless death\" and \"many ruined lives.\"\n\nRead more\n\nPurdue, Oklahoma settle lawsuit for $270 million\n\nMass. lawsuit says Purdue disregarded safety, opioid epidemic\n\nAs opioid crisis rages, battle moves to Ohio federal court", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Gs2jaaz4W__ZElRyhIemrBbM4n0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ODWNUBTX6AI6TPJFZGEVKXTXMY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4792938", "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 295722660}, {"uri": "1137686720", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-16", "time": "15:31:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-16T15:31:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.545098066329956, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/opinion/sunday/met-sackler.html", "title": "Opinion | The Met Is Right to Reject the Sacklers' Tainted Money", "body": "Mr. Giridharadas is the author of \"Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World.\"\n\nWhen it comes to blood money for the arts, how bloody is too bloody?\n\nOn Wednesday, the Metropolitan Museum of Art decided that money made from selling the opioids that have killed several hundred thousand people is too bloody. It announced it would no longer take donations from members of the Sackler family linked to OxyContin. \"On occasion, we feel it's necessary to step away from gifts that are not in the public interest,\" Daniel H. Weiss, the Met's president, said.\n\n\"Gifts that are not in the public interest.\" It is a pregnant, important phrase. Coming on the heels of similar decisions by the Tate Modern in London and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, the spurning of Oxy-cash seems to reflect a growing awareness that gifts to the arts and other good causes are not only a way for ultra-wealthy people to scrub their consciences and reputations. Philanthropy can also be central to purchasing the immunity needed to profiteer at the expense of the common welfare.\n\nPerhaps accepting tainted money in such cases isn't just giving people a pass. Perhaps it is enabling misconduct against the public.\n\nThis was the startling assertion made by New York State in its civil complaint, filed in March, against members of the Sackler family and others involved in the opioid crisis. It accused defendants of seeking to \"profiteer from the plague they knew would be unleashed.\" And the lawsuit explicitly linked Sackler do-gooding with Sackler harm-doing: \"Ultimately, the Sacklers used their ill-gotten wealth to cover up their misconduct with a philanthropic campaign intending to whitewash their decades-long success in profiting at New Yorkers' expense.\"\n\nIt was strong stuff. The State of New York officially claiming that in taking Sackler money, arts institutions had allowed themselves to be used as lubricant in a death machine. \"It's a remarkable statement,\" Benjamin Soskis, a historian of philanthropy at the Urban Institute in Washington, told me this week, \"the sort of thing we heard from critics of philanthropy on the periphery of power but rarely, in recent decades, from those at the center.\"\n\nAre museums, opera houses, food pantries and other nonprofits to be held responsible for how their donors have made their money? It is a question being asked more and more as a century-old taboo shatters.\n\n\"No amount of charity in spending such fortunes can compensate in any way for the misconduct in acquiring them,\" Theodore Roosevelt said after John D. Rockefeller proposed to start a foundation in 1909. It was not a lonely thought at the time.\n\nBut in the decades since, not least because of the amount of philanthropic coin that has been spent (can it still be called bribing when millions are the recipients?), touching all corners of our cultural life, attitudes have changed. And, as I found in spending the last few years reporting on nonprofits and foundations, a deeply complicit silence took hold: It was understood that you don't challenge people on how they make their money, how they pay their taxes (or don't), what continuing deeds they may be engaged in -- so long as they \"give back.\"\n\nWhen I speak privately with people working in nonprofits, as I often do, especially younger people, I hear this complaint again and again: They agonize about having to stay quiet not only about their donors' membership in a class that has benefited from an age of inequality but also about specific conduct by many donors that often worsens the problems the donors and nonprofits are working to solve.\n\nAnd so the decision by the Met and the other museums may be a small sign that this compact is cracking -- and perhaps that nonprofits are taking a broader view of their role in public life: not only as doers of good in a particular area of work but also, if they're not careful, as enablers of broader, if more generalized, societal harm.\n\n\"Turning down money runs against the grain of the thinking that's long governed charitable boards -- that they are stewards of the interests of particular institutions, with considerations of broader public interest being peripheral,\" Mr. Soskis, the historian, said when I asked him about the Met. \"What we are seeing more and more of, through the spread of social media, and an increased willingness to critically engage major philanthropic gifts, is the assertion of the public's interest in the philanthropic exchange.\"\n\nRelatedMore on the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma.The Met Will Turn Down Sackler Money Amid Fury Over the Opioid CrisisMay 15, 2019Opinion | Barry Meier: Opioid Makers Are the Big Winners in Lawsuit SettlementsDec. 26, 2018Origins of an Epidemic: Purdue Pharma Knew Its Opioids Were Widely AbusedMay 29, 2018\n\nIt remains to be seen whether other arts institutions will follow the lead of the Met, Tate and Guggenheim -- and more broadly, whether the nonprofit sector will begin asking itself some deeply uncomfortable questions. Should anyone working to make cities better and more equitable take money from JPMorgan Chase, which paid a huge sum for its role in helping to bring about the 2008 mortgage disaster and financial crisis? Should anyone working to help families affected by President Trump's immigration policies take money from Mark Zuckerberg, whose soft-pedaling of Russian interference in the 2016 election allowed anti-immigrant hate to spread and potentially helped Trump gain votes? Should any health institution take money tied to Pepsi or Coca-Cola?\n\nMake no mistake: To ask these questions opens a can of worms. The Sacklers are an easy case. Once the complicity turns more diffuse, it is hard to say whether a nonprofit is participating in an injustice by taking money -- or doing the best it can in a flawed reality. What's next after this? Is there a statute of limitations on looking for blood money? What kind of moral purity test are these institutions supposed to use? Once you begin to raise these dilemmas, how do you actually draw those lines around what's acceptable?\n\nThe Met has already drawn some lines. It won't remove the Sackler name from its galleries; it won't return money already donated. What it should do is go beyond a single act of rebuffing to model a new process for evaluating money. Past and future donations could be judged on various criteria: Was the money legally and fairly made? Is the money owed to tax evasion or extreme legal tax avoidance? Is the museum effectively selling a modern papal indulgence for a sin that shouldn't be so easily pardoned? Does the donor have a duty of reparation to people they have exploited or harmed that gives those parties more of a right to the money?\n\nAnd the public should be brought into the process. Public-facing institutions enjoy the privilege of being untaxed, so citizens should be able to comment on and scrutinize prospective donations.\n\nThese questions will long be with us. For now, these museums have forced an essential conversation. For far too long, generosity has been allowed to serve as a wingman of injustice; giving back disguises merciless taking; making a difference becomes inseparable from making a killing -- sometimes literally.

(Mickey Welsh/Montgomery Advertiser/AP)\n\nAlabama's three abortion clinics insist they're not planning to close their doors, even as a new state law threatens to criminalize the procedures they provide.\n\n\"We've been through this fight over and over again,\" Dalton Johnson, owner of the Alabama's Women's Center, told me yesterday. \"Our main goal is to keep the women apprised that we will be challenging it in court.\"\n\nAlabama's Women's Center in Huntsville -- whose two doctors provide about 2,000 abortions every year -- is one of just three abortion clinics left in a state where there were more than 20 back in the 1990s. Now the abortions they provide would become almost entirely illegal under a sweeping restriction signed yesterday by Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R), who said in a statement that the legislation \"stands as a powerful testament to Alabamians' deeply held belief that every life is precious and that every life is a sacred gift from God.\"\n\nThe measure, which is easily the most restrictive abortion law in the country, would make performing an abortion a criminal act -- including in cases of rape or incest. Doctors caught attempting to perform an abortion could face up to 10 years in prison and those who actually complete the procedure could receive a sentence as long as 99 years. The law does not penalize the woman receiving the abortion.\n\nThere are three exceptions in which it permits abortions: if the woman's life is at risk, if the fetus has a \"lethal anomaly\" or if the pregnancy is ectopic, in which a fertilized egg is implanted outside the uterus.\n\nFrom the advocacy and political arm of Planned Parenthood Southeast:\n\nThe Onion poked fun at the law's lack of exceptions for rape and incest:\n\nThe law doesn't go into effect for six months. But the American Civil Liberties Union has said it will petition the courts for an injunction halting the law from taking effect at all. And it is likely to be successful, considering the Alabama law is more drastic than \"heartbeat\" restrictions courts have already blocked in several states.\n\nBut to antiabortion advocates, getting the law enacted in Alabama isn't really the point. Their strategy is to get the Supreme Court -- now tilted 5 to 4 in favor of conservatives -- to consider overturning its 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion by passing a slew of abortion restrictions that clearly violate that standard (here are some great Washington Post graphics showing where states have advanced abortion restrictions and protections).\n\nAntiabortion advocacy group Susan B. Anthony List:\n\nAlabama Women's Center is unique in two respects, Johnson told me. It's the state's only clinic with doctors who have hospital admitting privileges, and it's the only one that performs abortions up to the state's current legal limit of 20 weeks of pregnancy. The clinic performs between 400 and 500 second-trimester abortions every year.\n\nBecause of these factors, the clinic sees patients from across Alabama as well as the nearby states of Mississippi, Tennessee, Louisiana and the Florida Panhandle, Johnson said.\n\n\"We get patients coming from six and eight hours away all the time, on a regular basis,\" Johnson said.\n\nAlabama Women's Center is on the north end of the state. Reproductive Health Services is in Montgomery, in the center of the state, and West Alabama Women's Center in Tuscaloosa is to the west. When I called those two clinics, receptionists who answered the phone said they plan to stay open as long as possible.\n\n\"If the law goes into effect ... we're not criminals; we would not be able to stay open,\" said an employee at the West Alabama Women's Center, who referred me to the ACLU for further comment. \"But until it's all resolved, we will be here.\"\n\n\"We don't see any interruption in any kind of service whatsoever,\" said an employee of Reproductive Health Services.\n\nThere's a good possibility the Supreme Court will confront a state abortion restriction in its term that begins in October -- but the Alabama law probably isn't at the top of its list, my Post colleague Robert Barnes explains. The justices are much more likely to take a gradual approach on the issue, perhaps by considering Louisiana's abortion doctor requirements or Indiana's ban on sex, race or disability-selective abortions.\n\n\"The court in general -- and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. in particular -- prefers a step-by-step process when shifting the court's jurisprudence, rather than disposing of an iconic landmark ruling in one grand gesture,\" Robert writes. \"That would probably hold true especially for one as etched in the American public's consciousness as Roe.\"\n\nThere's a reason state legislators hadn't yet attempted criminalizing the provision of abortions, per The Post's Aaron Blake. Americans have historically supported modest increases in abortion restrictions but overwhelmingly oppose the kind of legislation Alabama passed.\n\nSome abortion foes appeared skeptical of Alabama's new law. Longtime televangelist Pat Robertson decried Alabama's new abortion ban as \"extreme,\" saying on his show yesterday that the state legislature has \"gone too far,\" my Post colleague Sarah Pulliam Bailey reports.\n\n\"They want to challenge Roe vs. Wade, but my humble view is I don't think that's the case I'd want to bring to the Supreme Court because I think this one will lose,\" Robertson told viewers of CBN's \"The 700 Club\" on Wednesday.\n\nSen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) appeared none too eager to discuss the law, via HuffPost's Igor Bobic:\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), via NBC News's Frank Thorp:\n\nThe new law drew heated denouncements from abortion rights advocates, Democrats and 2020 presidential contenders, some of whom seized the opportunity to ask for donations to Planned Parenthood.\n\nAHH: The Food and Drug Administration is set to approve a second gene treatment for infants with spinal muscular atrophy that will cost $1.5 million to $5 million - it will be the costliest drug on the planet.\n\nIt's only the second drug on the market for the rare disease after a gene treatment was first introduced in 2016, as our Post colleague Christopher Rowland reports. Biogen, the drugmaker behind the initial treatment, had already drawn criticism for the price tag of the drug Spinraza, which costs $750,000 for the first year and $375,000 for each subsequent year.\n\nBut the new drug is set to kick off a \"new era of debates over cost and value as gene therapies are developed for growing numbers of rare diseases\" and it has already set off a clash between the manufacturer of the new drug, Novartis, and Biogen. And the clash has already produced what independent communication experts describe as a coordinated effort featuring \"op-ed columns by former Cabinet secretaries warning about the safety of the Novartis therapy.\"\n\n\"The controversy is clouding the debate as parents, doctors, and insurance companies will soon be grappling with highly complex decisions over which drug to choose and how to pay for it,\" he adds. \"How the medical system handles these questions of safety, effectiveness and price will set a precedent for future battles. The FDA is poised to review more applications for gene therapies for inherited diseases such as hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\"\n\nOOF: North Carolina has filed a lawsuit against e-cigarette maker Juul Labs, alleging the company has been \"deceptively downplaying the potency and danger of the nicotine.\" The suit, filed by state Attorney General Joshua Stein, also accuses the company of using advertising tactics to target underage users, our Post colleague Deanna Paul reports.\n\n\"Addicting a new generation of teenagers is unacceptable, illegal, and that's why I'm taking action,\" Stein told The Post. \"This is about a company that is selling its product predominantly to [youth]. There has to be some limitation on the way they do business.\"\n\nE-cigarette use has been a focus of scrutiny at the federal level. The Food and Drug Administration in March rolled out a policy meant to combat youth vaping. But North Carolina's suit goes a step further than what the FDA has already called for. In addition to calling for a ban on sales of Juul and other such products to minors, North Carolina has requested that mint-flavored products and popular fruit flavors such as mango be taken off the market.\n\nThe state also wants the court to employ a marketing ban that would block the company from specific advertising via email or social media that targets minors, and also wants the court to stop Juul from advertising in certain spaces, such as near playgrounds or schools, where young consumers are targeted.\n\nA Juul spokesman said the company shares \"the Attorney General's concerns about youth vaping, which is why we have been cooperating with his office and why we have taken the most aggressive actions of anyone in the industry to combat youth usage.\"\n\nOOF: A federal judge has temporarily blocked a controversial policy for distributing scarce livers for transplant, a ruling that comes just one day after the new rule was implemented.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg had initially decided not to halt the rules, asking the government to voluntarily delay the policy until the Supreme Court could weigh in on a relevant case, our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports. When the Department of Health and Human Services moved ahead with the policy anyway, the judge stepped in.\n\n\"For years, transplant hospitals generally had first claim to organs donated in their areas. The new policy offers livers to the sickest patients as far as 500 nautical miles from the donor. It was approved after a lawsuit was filed in New York by patients who said they were waiting longer for livers than less-ill people in other parts of the country,\" Lenny writes. \"The plaintiffs -- which include transplant centers in Georgia, Michigan, Kansas, Missouri and elsewhere, as well as people on the waiting list for livers -- say the rules will leave patients in those places with about 20 percent fewer organs than the current policy, resulting in an increase in waiting-list deaths ... Supporters of the new policy maintain, however, that regional disparities have become too great.\"\n\n\"Given the gravity of the medical issues and risk of disruption in the transplant system and the concrete likelihood of harm to the plaintiffs and the public at large if the status quo is not maintained, the Court finds that the public interest is best served\" by keeping the old policy in place, Totenberg wrote in her decision.\n\n-- New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art announced it will stop accepting donations from the Sackler family that has been at the center of growing criticism for its role in the nation's opioid crisis.\n\nThe family connected to OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma has donated to museums around the world for decades. As members of the family face lawsuits from hundreds of cities and counties for allegedly fueling the opioid crisis with deceptive marketing practices, other major art institutions have announced they would stop taking gifts from the family, including the Tate galleries and National Portrait Gallery in London and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, as our Post colleague Peggy McGlone reports.\n\n\"The Met said that its decision came after a months-long review of its gift policies, which was prompted by the public outcry over the Sackler gifts,\" Peggy writes. \"The Sackler donations to the Met -- including the gift that funded the wing housing the museum's Temple of Dendur -- date back half a century. The museum does not plan to remove the Sackler name.\"\n\n-- Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), and Tom Carper (D-Del.) have introduced the latest legislative effort to protect patients from unexpected medical bills.\n\nThe bipartisan STOP Surprise Medical Bills Act is meant to protect patients who get emergency care at an out-of-network facility or by an out-of-network provider, pateints who receive elective services at an in-network facility by out-of-network providers and patients who need additional services at an out-of-network facility if they need medical transport from such a facility. Under the bill, patients will only be responsible for their in-network cost-sharing.\n\n\"Patients should be the reason for the care, not an excuse for the bill,\" Cassidy said in a statement. \"This is a bipartisan solution ensuring patients are protected and don't receive surprise bills that are uncapped by anything but a sense of shame.\"\n\n-- In an effort to prevent wasted spending on health services that may result from misdiagnoses, Walmart has started recommending its workers use high-quality imaging centers for CT scans and MRIs.\n\nThe company is the largest private employer in the nation, and its health plan covers 1.1 million employees and dependents in the United States, Kaiser Health News's Phil Galewitz reports, adding that it also seems to be the first such major employer to direct its workers toward a specific service, in this case an imaging provider, because of accuracy rather than because of price.\n\n\"Walmart employees are not required to use those 800 centers, but if they don't use one that is available near them, they will have to pay additional cost sharing,\" Phil writes. \"Company officials advise workers that they could have more accurate results if they opt for the specified centers.\"\n\nThe shift first started after the company noticed a trend in workers who had misdiagnosed health conditions after going to certain specialized hospitals, which turned out to be a result of high error rates in their diagnostic imaging.\n\nLisa Woods, the senior director of benefits design at the Walmart pointed to a long-term benefit, even if the new effort is not specifically about saving money. \"It's been demonstrated time and time again that high quality ends up being more economical in the long run because inappropriate care is avoided, and patients do better,\" she said.\n\nWhat the Alabama governor has said about abortions so far:\n\nWhat Alabama's abortion legislation could mean for the rest of the country:", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/19b7dbd5b770587902190f0b9ad39151-3000-1940-70-8-5DX3EEDWYYI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4787615", "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 295704480}, {"uri": "1136990783", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-15", "time": "20:52:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-15T20:52:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8156862854957581, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/citing-opioid-ties-the-met-says-it-will-no-longer-accept-gifts-from-the-sackler-family/2019/05/15/e66ac2d8-7742-11e9-b7ae-390de4259661_story.html", "title": "Citing opioid ties, the Met says it will no longer accept gifts from the Sackler family", "body": "The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which decided to no longer accept Sackler donations after a months-long review of its gift policies. (Seth Wenig/AP) By Peggy McGlone Peggy McGlone Reporter covering the arts in the Washington region May 15 at 4:38 PM\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art announced Wednesday that it will no longer accept donations from the Sackler family of philanthropists who built their fortune from the development and sale of opioids.\n\nThe Met's decision comes amid mounting criticism of the Sacklers' role in the opioid crisis. Hundreds of cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits claiming that eight Sackler family members were involved in deceptive marketing practices of the family-owned pharmaceutical company, Purdue Pharma, and its blockbuster painkiller drug, OxyContin.\n\nThree other art institutions -- the Tate galleries and National Portrait Gallery in London and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York -- previously announced that they would not accept gifts from the family.\n\nFor decades, the Sacklers have supported high-profile cultural and educational institutions around the world -- from the Met to Harvard University to the Louvre. But artists and social media activists have criticized those relationships and called on the institutions to return the Sackler gifts and remove the name from their walls. In response to protests, the Sackler Trust, one of the family's philanthropic arms, announced in March that it was suspending donations.\n\n[The Sacklers have donated millions to museums, but the opioid crisis is threatening its legacy]\n\nThe Met's decision affects the branches of the family related to Purdue Pharma. In 1952, Sackler brothers Arthur, Mortimer and Raymond bought a small pharmaceutical company, and in 1987, Mortimer and Raymond bought out Arthur's share after his death. Purdue Pharma was established in 1991.\n\nThe Smithsonian's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution has drawn a similar distinction regarding the branches of the family and the source of their wealth. The Smithsonian's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery opened in 1987, months after its benefactor died and years before OxyContin came on the market. Arthur Sackler donated 1,000 objects and $4 million to the museum, and the Smithsonian is contractually bound to keep the family name on the Asian art museum, according to a spokeswoman, who added that future donations are not in the works.\n\n\"We have no plans to approach any member of the Sackler family for a donation,\" spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas said Wednesday, repeating the response from March, when the Guggenheim made its announcement.\n\n['Shame on Sackler': Anti-opioid activists call out late Smithsonian donor at his namesake museum]\n\nArthur's widow and Smithsonian donor, Jillian Sackler, has repeatedly said her husband had no role in the opioid crisis. \"It is a gross injustice to blame [Arthur],\" she said in a statement earlier this year. \"Not a penny of his philanthropy derived from the sale of OxyContin, and it is a disservice to the institutions he founded to suggest otherwise.\"\n\nThe Met said that its decision came after a months-long review of its gift policies, which was prompted by the public outcry over the Sackler gifts. The decision was first reported in the New York Times.\n\n\"Private philanthropy literally built The Metropolitan Museum of Art,\" Met president and chief executive Daniel Weiss said in a statement. \"What distinguishes our Museum from its global peers, such as the Prado, the Hermitage, and the Louvre, is the fact that we did not begin with a royal or imperial collection. Every object and much of the building itself came from individuals driven by a love for art and the spirit of philanthropy.\n\n\"For this reason, it is our responsibility to ensure that the public is aware of the diligence that we take to generate philanthropic support. Our donors deserve this, and the public should expect it.\"\n\nThe Sackler donations to the Met -- including the gift that funded the wing housing the museum's Temple of Dendur -- date back half a century.

Guggenheim Museum in New York, to distance themselves from the family behind Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. On Wednesday, the American Museum of Natural History said that it, too, had ceased taking Sackler donations.\n\nThe moves reflect the growing outrage over the role the Sacklers may have played in the opioid crisis, as well as an energized activist movement that is starting to force museums to reckon with where some of their money comes from.\n\n\"The museum takes a position of gratitude and respect to those who support us, but on occasion, we feel it's necessary to step away from gifts that are not in the public interest, or in our institution's interest,\" said Daniel H. Weiss, the president of the Met. \"That is what we're doing here.\"\n\nThe Met's relationship with the Sacklers goes back decades, and one of its biggest attractions, the Temple of Dendur, sits in the glass-enclosed Sackler Wing. Mr. Weiss said the museum had no plans to remove the name, as some protesters have demanded.\n\nBut its decision to stop accepting future gifts from Sacklers connected to Purdue Pharma, or their foundations, could spur other cultural institutions to follow suit. The family has given tens of millions of dollars and put its name in or on museums, universities and medical schools in the United States, England and Israel.\n\nIn the New York area alone, in addition to the Met, the Guggenheim and the Natural History museum, the Metropolitan Opera and the Dia Art Foundation are among the institutions that have received substantial gifts from the Sacklers.\n\nIn a statement, the Sackler family members with ties to Purdue Pharma said that \"while the allegations against our family are false and unfair, we understand that accepting gifts at this time would put the Met in a difficult position.\"\n\n\"We respect the Met and that is the last thing we would want to do,\" the statement said. \"Our goal has always been to support the valuable work of such outstanding organizations, and we remain committed to doing so.\"\n\nThe move by the Met comes as the Whitney Museum also finds itself caught in the politics of the era, facing growing calls from artists, protesters and even some museum staff members to remove one of its vice chairmen, Warren B. Kanders, from its board. Mr. Kanders is the chief executive of Safariland Group, which sells equipment to law enforcement agencies and militaries, including tear gas, which the art publication Hyperallergic said was used against migrants at the Mexican border.\n\nDozens of artists connected to the Whitney Biennial, a prestigious contemporary art exhibition that begins on Friday, signed an open letter calling for his resignation. And a group called Forensic Architecture, in partnership with Praxis Films, has made its Biennial exhibition a direct challenge to Mr. Kanders: It will show a 10-minute film that documents instances where Safariland's Triple-Chaser tear gas grenades have been deployed.\n\nMr. Kanders has rebuffed the demands for him to step down, saying that Safariland's products, which also include riot gear and bomb disposal robots, protect law enforcement officers and let them defuse dangerous situations without loss of life. He said he had no role in how the company's products were ultimately deployed.\n\nThe increased scrutiny on donors is forcing museums to navigate moral dilemmas and a political climate where a protest can go viral in a matter of hours. At the same time, they must mollify the wealthy benefactors who help keep the lights on and would rather not see their donations open them up to public examination.\n\nThere is also the difficult question of where to draw a line. What sort of behavior is inexcusable?\n\n\"We are not a partisan organization, we are not a political organization, so we don't have a litmus test for whom we take gifts from based on policies or politics,\" Mr. Weiss said. \"If there are people who want to support us, for the most part we are delighted.\"\n\n\"We would only not accept gifts from people if it in some way challenges or is counter to the core mission of the institution, in exceptional cases,\" he added. \"The OxyContin crisis in this country is a legitimate and full-blown crisis.\"\n\nThree brothers, Arthur, Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, bought a small company called Purdue Frederick in 1952 and transformed it into the pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma. In 1996, Purdue put the opioid painkiller OxyContin on the market, fundamentally altering the company's fortunes.\n\nThe family's role in the marketing of OxyContin, and in the opioid crisis, has come under increased scrutiny in recent years. Documents submitted this year as part of litigation by the attorney general of Massachusetts allege that members of the Sackler family directed the company's efforts to mislead the public about the dangers of the highly addictive drug. The company has denied the allegations and said it \"neither created nor caused the opioid epidemic.\"\n\nArthur Sackler died before OxyContin's creation and his side of the family, which has supported institutions including the Smithsonian and the Brooklyn Museum, has not played a role in Purdue Pharma for years. One of his children, Elizabeth A. Sackler, has called the company's role in the opioid epidemic \"morally abhorrent.\"\n\nMr. Weiss, who described the Met's decision as a \"suspension,\" said the museum would refuse only gifts from members of the Sackler family closely connected to Purdue. Those gifts have exceeded $200,000 over the last two decades, a small amount for a museum with a $320 million annual budget, but the symbolism was unmistakable.\n\nThe family's contributions to the Met go back some 50 years. A 1978 news release announcing the official dedication of the Sackler Wing said it cost $9.5 million to build -- about $36 million in today's dollars -- and called the Sacklers \"major donors\" to the project. At the dedication reception, which was jointly hosted by the Met and the three brothers, the Martha Graham Dance Company performed a new work at the Temple of Dendur, which was a gift from Egypt to the United States.\n\nMr. Weiss said that the museum would not take the more drastic step of taking the family's name off the wing, saying that it was not in a position to make permanent changes while litigation against the family was ongoing and information still coming to light.\n\nThe Met also said that its board had voted to codify how the museum accepts named gifts, formalizing a longstanding practice of circulating those proposals through a chain of departments. The decision on the Sacklers, Mr. Weiss said, was made by the Met leadership in consultation with the board.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_a_harris@nytimes.com", "name": "Elizabeth A.

Now They Say It Was a Fraud.", "body": "BECKLEY, W.Va. -- On a spring day in 2017, Stephanie Frame sat down in her hilltop home deep in the mountain hollows to record a video.\n\nShe began with the litany of local decline: the vanishing jobs in the coal mines, the shuttering stores, the school that closed down. During one stretch of unemployment for her coal miner husband, the two had resorted to selling ramps, ginseng and yellowroot that they had dug up in the forest.\n\nBut this video, aimed at her neighbors, was an announcement: Redemption was here. A nonprofit called Mined Minds, promising to teach West Virginians how to write computer code and then get them good-paying jobs, was looking for recruits.\n\n\"I wholeheartedly believe, and will always believe,\" Ms. Frame said to the camera, \"that God has sent Mined Minds to us to save us from what could have been a very bleak future.\"\n\nShe had every reason to believe. Joe Manchin III, her Democratic senator, had invited the group to come into the state. The National Guard hired it to teach at its military-style academy. County commissioners arranged space rent free. National news outlets gave glowing coverage.\n\nMany West Virginians like Ms. Frame signed up for Mined Minds, quitting their jobs or dropping out of school for the prized prospect of a stable and lucrative career. But the revival never came.\n\nAlmost none of those who signed up for Mined Minds are working in programming now. They described Mined Minds as an erratic operation, where guarantees suddenly evaporated and firings seemed inevitable, leaving people to start over again at the bottom rungs of the wage jobs they had left behind.\n\nOver two dozen former students in West Virginia are pursuing a lawsuit, arguing that Mined Minds was a fraud. Out of the 10 or so people who made it to the final weeks of Ms. Frame's class in Beckley, only one formally graduated. He is now delivering takeout.\n\n\"It was a too-good-to-be-true kind of deal,\" said Billyjack Buzzard, 33, who attended another class and was the only former West Virginia coal miner to finish classes and get a job with the program. He was fired after 14 months and went back underground. \"Just false hope.\"\n\nMined Minds came into Appalachia espousing a certain dogma, fostered in the world of start-ups and TED Talks, and carried with missionary zeal into places in dire need of economic salvation. The group was premised on the notion, as one grant proposal read, that \"anyone can have a successful career in the technology industry,\" and that if enough people did, the whole area would be transformed.\n\nAmanda Laucher, one of the founders of Mined Minds, spoke at a tech conference in 2017 of the group's ambitions, which were swiftly expanding. \"Yeah, we helped a town, we actually made some small impact,\" she said of Mined Minds' early efforts. \"But can we scale it and actually diversify the economy of an entire region?\"\n\nThis would be an audacious goal even in the best of circumstances. But Mined Mines was operating with a limited amount of personal cash and public funding, and was mostly staffed by people who had spent little time in tech.\n\nMs. Laucher now acknowledges that while she is still committed to the group's mission, the work has not been easy. \"Progress is difficult,\" she said in an email, \"with the current atmosphere in Appalachia which is deeply interested in maintaining a 'culture.'\"\n\nShe blamed the opioid epidemic and \"the poverty culture\" of the region, mentioning \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" the best-selling memoir by J.D. Vance, who, like Ms. Laucher, went from working-class Rust Belt roots to success in the tech sector.\n\nShe added: \"There are generations of hard work ahead. We'll be only a tiny force working toward change in the area I grew up.\"\n\nNone of this -- neither the experience itself nor Ms. Laucher's thoughts about its difficulties -- strikes some former students as surprising. This is, they say, how things tend to go in Appalachia.\n\n\"I get angry at people who go to other places and say, 'My culture is better than theirs and I am going to change it,'\" said Katie Bolyard, 25, a college graduate who skipped her honeymoon to take a class.\n\nShe doesn't know the motives of the people at Mined Minds, she said, whether they had bad intentions or were just \"incredibly sloppy\" with good ones. But intentions only matter so much. \"It's not your life you're messing with.\"\n\n'They All Find a Job'\n\nBefore the founding of Mined Minds, Ms. Laucher and her husband, Jonathan Graham, were living in Chicago working as successful tech consultants. But in 2015, she learned that her younger brother, Marvin, had been laid off from a mine back in the coalfields of southwest Pennsylvania where she grew up.\n\nHe was stuck in the Appalachian dilemma: technologically savvy, as modern miners have to be, but stuck with few options. So Mr. Graham and Ms. Laucher quit their jobs and moved to Pennsylvania.\n\nThe model for Mined Mines, at least initially, was this: a free 16-week coding boot camp, followed by paid \"apprenticeships\" with the program's for-profit arm, a software consultancy. Apprentices worked full-time on projects for company clients, but were also called upon to teach in the classes they had graduated from months earlier. After working for a few months, apprentices would either go on to salaried jobs at the Mined Minds company, or to a big tech firm such as Oracle.\n\n\"Every single one of them\" finds work, Ms. Laucher said of the boot camp graduates, in a 2017 interview. \"They all find a job.\"\n\nA guarantee like that was barely short of miraculous. Within two years, Mined Minds was one of the primary beneficiaries of a $1.5 million grant from the Appalachian Regional Commission. In August 2016, Mr. Manchin, who encouraged the couple to expand from Pennsylvania, said that Mr. Graham and Ms. Laucher \"embody the spirit of West Virginia.\"\n\nIn the spring of 2017, Tori Frame, Stephanie Frame's daughter, was making $10 an hour as an assistant manager at a Family Dollar store when she learned about Mined Minds.\n\n\"I didn't want to be stuck in Gauley Bridge, W.Va., my whole life working at Family Dollar,\" said Tori, 23. \"I wanted something different.\"\n\nOthers viewed Mined Minds the same way. Andrew Farley figured he could quickly make the pay scale in coding that he made working for the railroad, but without having to leave his hometown; Chris Phelps, who washed dishes at a Cracker Barrel, thought a tech career was a way to get out of town.\n\nTy Cook, 29, a bank teller, saw something more, \"something that would make me a worthwhile member of society.\"\n\nAnd there was an irresistible promise: They would be paid to take the class. Some were told this in an email by a state jobs counselor, others said they were told by Ms. Laucher. The counselor said in an email they would receive $10 an hour, with the potential for more as apprentices or when they were hired. A number of people, including Tori, quit their jobs. (Ms. Laucher has denied making any such promise.)\n\nIn late June 2017, a big crowd gathered in a classroom at a small college campus in Beckley. They met Marvin Laucher, Ms. Laucher's brother, the former coal miner, now their main instructor. They also learned that they were not going to be paid. Some dropped out the first week.\n\nBut Tori and her mother, Stephanie, 45, stayed. Every weekday morning, Tori would wake up early, her mother would feed the chickens and together they would head down the serpentine mountain road to Beckley. Nights and weekends they spent in the glow of their laptops -- bought from a website on credit -- learning the rudiments of Ruby, the programming language.\n\nThere was never much of a syllabus; students would be given an assignment and spend the next few days trying to figure it out, mostly by themselves. The usual answer to questions, multiple students said, was \"Google it.\" A few quietly wondered how much their teachers really knew.\n\nUnease began to settle in among some of the students. They began to learn from their teaching assistants, graduates of a recent Mined Minds class, that the good stable jobs promised by the group were not nearly as stable as they appeared.\n\nFirings and resignations were routine among the staff. One of the Beckley teaching assistants, a 33-year-old named Maxx Turner, had already been fired, then rehired after several fruitless months of searching for programming work, he said. Some began to suspect that the program couldn't afford the job guarantee it was advertising.\n\nMoney woes did not make sense, given what they saw of the founders' lifestyle: the travels worldwide, the views from an office in Chicago's Trump Tower, the ever-replenishing tequila bottles at the West Virginia headquarters, the boozy house parties in Pennsylvania.\n\nSeveral former Mined Minds staff members described company gatherings the same way: Their bosses ordering seemingly endless shots, hectoring the more timid drinkers. \"I thought by going out drinking with them I'd put myself in a better position,\" said Michael Moore, 35, the other teaching assistant in Beckley, who dropped out of community college to take the program.\n\nThe promised 16-week class went on 17 weeks. Then 18, then 19. As the class continued, many students began to run out of money. Out of the more than two dozen students who began, about 10 were left by late October, some playing computer games in class to pass the time, just waiting for the final project before graduation.\n\nA Fateful Trip\n\nEarly on, Ms. Laucher had suggested the project would be something for the community, maybe a gaming app addressing the opioid epidemic. Then the project was finally announced: the design of a website for a pet bed-and-breakfast that Ms. Laucher's mother was opening in Pennsylvania.\n\nBut Stephanie Frame was still a believer. When word spread of a trip by the Mined Minds leadership to a tech conference in Lithuania in November, she saw an opportunity. She had never been out of the country, but this was a way to lock in a job, for her and for her daughter. Her husband agreed to spend $1,000 on the trip.\n\n\"If I could hang with them,\" she remembered thinking, \"be one of them, show them how dedicated I am, how much I supported them, then we've got it.\"\n\nWhile Stephanie and others were in Lithuania, the rest of the class was debating whether to stick it out to graduation. A news station in Pennsylvania had reported on problems with the Mined Minds program there, including that nearly all the graduates of one class had been fired right after being hired as apprentices. The state of Pennsylvania ordered Mined Minds to cease operations for not having a license to run a school.\n\nOn a morning in late November, in the first class after the Lithuania conference, the students in Beckley arrived to a shocking development. Two people who had gone on the trip -- Stephanie Frame and Mr. Moore, their teaching assistant -- had been kicked out of the program.\n\nIn a video conference, Ms. Laucher told the class that Stephanie had been dismissed because of \"extreme sexual harassment, lots of drunkenness, basically behaving in a way that we wouldn't condone at Mined Minds.\"\n\nStephanie was stunned. She thought the trip had been successful. She had gotten very drunk, she said, but no one on the trip had mentioned anything like \"extreme sexual harassment.\" Mr. Moore said he had seen nothing like the harassment Ms. Laucher described, and that in any case, everyone had been drunk.\n\nHe would later be told that he was being dismissed for being belligerent one night of the trip, and also of having a drug problem -- a charge, he said, easily refuted by years of clean drug tests -- including one for Mined Minds.\n\nAs Ms. Laucher shared the news, other students were angry, and suspicious.\n\n\"Even in the moment I'm hearing this I'm thinking, 'O.K., this isn't adding up,'\" Mr. Phelps said.\n\nMs. Bolyard wondered whether Mined Minds simply couldn't afford the apprenticeships. \"They were just making excuses to get rid of people,\" she said.\n\nTori's parents told her to just finish the class, but she couldn't. She sent a formal resignation letter, citing broken promises and a \"party culture\" that turned her off. Nearly all of the other students, infuriated by the whole thing, followed.\n\n'It Repeats Itself'\n\nMined Minds has continued operating, holding new classes in Logan, another hard-luck coal town in West Virginia.\n\nIn mid-April of this year, Ms. Laucher reprimanded five employees for not making enough networking connections on LinkedIn, for neglecting to read a book she had assigned, \"The Start-Up of You,\" and for not submitting their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to her for help. The next day, all five were fired. The staff of the program in West Virginia, two of those former employees said, now consists of Ms. Laucher's brother and sister.\n\nAnd several weeks ago, Ms. Laucher announced on social media that she had been accepted to law school in Chicago.\n\nAsked if this was the end of Mined Minds, Ms. Laucher wrote: \"Absolutely not. Still going.\"\n\nSince the class in Beckley ended, Stephanie Frame has mostly stayed home.\n\nAs she recounted her experience with Mined Minds in her living room, her husband, Roger, just off work, sat down and listened. It's always the same here, he finally said.\n\n\"They're coming here promising stuff that they don't deliver,\" said Mr. Frame, his hands and face still gray with coal dust. \"People do that all the time. They've always done it to Appalachians.\"\n\nHe recalled the pittance his great-grandparents sold their mineral rights for, and what they got from it: the coal company tearing down mountains and building roads wherever it wanted. Timber, coal, oil and gas, \"it repeats itself,\" he said. \"It's like a never-ending cycle.\"\n\nMembers of the Beckley class still keep in touch on a private chat group they call \"Disenfranchised Appalachians.\" Nearly everyone they had worked alongside has quit or been fired, though some said they had learned a lot from their work at Mined Minds. One, usually described as the program's clear success, found a programming job in South Carolina.\n\nStephanie's daughter Tori, who had begun dating Ty Cook from the class, went back to the Family Dollar, starting over as a cashier.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nPresident Trump struck a conciliatory tone yesterday as he advocated protecting consumers from surprise medical bills. But differences between the White House and members of Congress over precisely how to do that are already emerging.\n\nThe difference is over whether to use a process known as \"baseball-style arbitration\" to settle billing disputes between insurers and health providers. Senators working on surprise-billing legislation said arbitration is a proven, effective approach, even as White House officials threw cold water on the idea.\n\nLet's back up for a minute. In an address at the White House (which The Health 202 previewed here), the president laid out broad areas of agreement regarding the bills incurred by many Americans when, through no fault of their own, they receive care at an emergency room outside their health plan's network or are unexpectedly seen by an out-of-network doctor even though they're at an in-network hospital.\n\nPoliticians and industry folks agree that patients shouldn't be forced to pay these extra bills, which can be thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. Trump said Congress should work quickly to stop the practice, which he said is bankrupting patients by charging them for \"unexpected health-care costs that are absolutely out of control.\"\n\n\"No family should be blindsided by outrageous medical bills,\" the president said.\n\nSeveral victims of surprise medical billing were standing next to Trump and even allowed to make some of their own remarks. Health reporters have told many of their stories. Reuters reporter Chad Terhune:\n\nStanding next to Trump were two senators working on legislation to protect patients from surprise medical bills. Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), along with Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), are leading a bipartisan effort to craft legislation laying out exactly how insurers and providers can reach agreement on out-of-network bills without involving patients.\n\nThe group has yet to unveil legislation -- they've promised it will be ready in the next few weeks -- but both Cassidy and Hassan hinted strongly they prefer baseball-style arbitration. In this process, which Hassan has proposed separately in previous legislation, a third party collects two figures -- what the doctor is charging and what the insurer is agreeing to pay -- and decides which figure is fairest.\n\nThe process is similar to the way salaries for Major League Baseball players are decided. The player and the team are permitted to name the salary they feel is most appropriate, and an independent arbiter picks one. Both sides are incentivized to offer realistic salaries because they want the figure they've cited to win out.\n\nThe state of New York, which passed arbitration legislation in 2015, has been successful in reducing out-of-network emergency room billing. The percent of out-of-network emergency department services that were billed decreased from 20 percent in 2013 to 6 percent after the law was implemented, according to Yale University researchers.\n\n\"I'm a big believer that the states experiment and we learn from their experiment,\" Cassidy said. \"Arbitration has worked in New York.\"\n\nBut in a news briefing earlier in the day, White House officials said they don't favor arbitration, calling it an \"unnecessary distraction.\"\n\n\"We do not have a lot of enthusiasm for arbitration,\" a senior administration official told reporters. \"We believe that would be disruptive. And we believe ... at the end of the day, a lot of potential abuses disguised in a different form would nevertheless still be inflicted against patients and Americans.\"\n\nPolitico's Rachel Roubein:\n\nKaran Chhabra, a surgical resident at Brigham and Women's Hospital:\n\nInsurers were pleased by that position, as they have argued arbitration leads to unnecessarily high payments to doctors. \"Arbitration gives equal weight to inflated doctors' bills .\u2009.\u2009. [and] negotiated rates,\" Adam Beck, vice president for policy of America's Health Insurance Plans, told my Washington Post colleague Amy Goldstein.\n\nBut doctors groups also pointed to New York's example, saying the federal government should try what has worked for states. \"It's encouraging that the White House agrees with patients and physicians throughout the country who are urging Congress to take action,\" said Sherif Zaafran, chairman of Physicians for Fair Coverage. \"The best way to ensure no patient receives a surprise bill is for Congress to pass legislation with a dispute resolution process, which has already been implemented in nine states, including years of success in New York.\"\n\nChip Kahn, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, praised the administration's focus on the issue. \"We think that patients should be held harmless for these out-of-network charges to their expected cost-sharing, so the White House's interest focuses a light on an issue that Congress should address,\" he said.\n\nDespite his bipartisan tone, Trump couldn't resist promising yet again that Republicans would come up with another sweeping health-care bill, presumably to replace the Affordable Care Act Act. Per the Hill's Peter Sullivan:\n\nAHH: Gilead Sciences, the drugmaker behind the highly effective once-a-day HIV prevention medication, announced it would donate enough pills to cover as many as 200,000 people a year for up to 11 years. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the donation was \"a result of discussions between the Trump Administration and Gilead Sciences.\"\n\nThe company will donate up to 2.4 million bottles of the drug Truvada to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the agency will distribute the medication to people who are uninsured and at a high risk of contracting HIV, our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports.\n\nGilead's donation is part of the president's pledge to stop the spread of HIV in the country by 90 percent by 2030. \"The government strategy to curb the spread of HIV focuses on the small number of places where the virus is concentrated: the District of Columbia; Puerto Rico; 48 hot-spot counties across the country and in the rural parts of seven Southern states,\" Lenny writes. \"In 2017, the South had about 20,000 new HIV diagnoses, more than the rest of the country combined.\"\n\nA one year supply of the drug, known as PrEP, costs more than $20,000. \"The majority of Americans who are at risk and who could protect themselves with PrEP are still not receiving the medication,\" Azar said in a statement. \"This agreement will help close that gap substantially.\"\n\nThe bill, which is still expected to be passed by the conservative majority, is one of many measures introduced around the country making abortion illegal within the first few weeks of pregnancy. \"Alabama Rep. Terri Collins (R), who sponsored the bill, said its purpose is to spark litigation that would force the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that guarantees a woman's right to abortion,\" our Post colleagues Emily Wax-Thibodeaux and Ariana Eunjung Cha report.\n\nOUCH: The Kentucky teenager who sued a local health department after he was banned from school for not having the chickenpox vaccine contracted chickenpox last month.\n\nHis father believes that's a good thing, our Post colleague Michael Brice-Saddler reports. Chris Wiest, an attorney for the family, said the newfound immunity 18-year-old Jerome Kunkel has after contracting the disease is proof there was no need for a ban.\n\nIn March, the Northern Kentucky Health Department barred students who did not have proof they had received the chickenpox vaccine or were immune. Kunkel's family is against the vaccination because of religious beliefs, and sued the health department to end the ban.\n\n\"This is a stupid ban that's never going to work, \" the family's attorney said. \"We are not at all surprised. This is exactly what we told the court would happen. Over half my clients contracted chickenpox and had no complications, and now they have a lifetime immunity.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Northern Kentucky Health Department criticized Wiest's suggestion that people should contract the disease to become immune.\n\n\"While the tactic Wiest suggests may provide an individual with future immunity from chickenpox, this infected person can easily spread the virus to other, unsuspecting people, including those particularly vulnerable to this potentially life-threatening infection,\" the statement read. \"Encouraging the spread of an acute infectious disease in a community demonstrates a callous disregard for the health and safety of friends, family, neighbors, and unsuspecting members of the general public.\"\n\n-- Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Democratic presidential contender Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) have introduced a bill to address high maternal mortality rates, specifically pointing to the particularly high death rates for black women.\n\nThe Healthy MOMMIES Act looks to expand Medicaid to make sure pregnant women are covered across the pregnancy, labor and postpartum periods, increasing coverage from 60 to 365 days after giving birth. The bill ensures coverage beyond services only related to pregnancy.\n\nThe bill, introduced days before Mother's Day, also comes as a recent report from the CDC found that in the United States, there are 40 pregnancy-related deaths among black women for every 100,000 births. Black women are three times as likely as white women to die of pregnancy-related condition, the report found.\n\n\"The lived experiences of Black women demonstrate how racism and trauma directly impact the health and wellbeing of marginalized communities for generations,\" Pressley said in a statement. \"Maternal justice is about ensuring that every mom-to-be is listened to and treated with dignity and respect during and after childbirth. The Healthy MOMMIES Act would do just that by promoting a community-based, holistic approach to maternal care that recognizes current disparities in healthcare and critical environmental factors impacting communities.\"\n\n-- Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) introduced a bill meant to address skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs for consumers and increase transparency about the costs of medications they pick up at the pharmacy.\n\nThe Prescription Drug Rebate Reform Act of 2019 will mandate that coinsurance for patients be based on a percentage of net price, which is the price of a drug after rebates, discounts and fees. Patients currently pay coinsurance based on the drug's list price, which does not include those discounts. \"Drug prices -- and out of pocket expenses paid by consumers -- seem to continually be on the rise,\" Braun said in a statement.\n\n\"What is not talked about enough, however, is the inherent conflict of interest arising from negotiated rebates that affect the actual cost of drugs, which are paid by drug makers to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) in exchange for preferred status on insurers' health plan formularies ... These rebates are often hidden from consumers, contribute to high list prices for prescription drugs, and leave consumers with all, or a big part of the tab.\"\n\n-- There are signs the deadly opioid crisis is starting to slow in Maryland.\n\nAccording to preliminary data released from a state organization in Maryland, there were 2,114 opioid-related deaths last year in the state, which is an increase of 5.2 percent from the year prior. While still an uptick, it's the slowest single-year increase since 2011, according to the data released by Maryland's Opioid Operational Command Center in a first-of-its-kind report, our Post colleague Erin Cox reports.\n\nThe rise in annual fentanyl deaths was not as sharp last year as it was before, with a 17.1 percent increase in 2018 compared with a 42.5 percent jump the year before that. Still, more people were killed by fentanyl and fentanyl mixed with cocaine, while deaths from heroin and prescription painkillers declined last year, Erin reports.\n\nSteven R. Schuh, executive director of the state organization that tracks the government's response to the opioid crisis, said: \"We are encouraged that the epidemic is starting to plateau.\"\n\n-- A group of diabetes advocates traveled from Minnesota to Canada over the weekend in part to make a point about the cost of insulin.\n\n\"Can you explain to me why I would stay in the U.S. and continue to be price-gouged for $320 a vial when I can drive five hours and get it for $30?\" one of the participants in the mission told Stat's Nicholas Florko. \"The only difference between us and Canada is politicians here in America have not created any solutions to lower the price of insulin. ... The federal government, they talk about all these laws, but they can't get them passed.\"\n\nThat participant, Quinn Nystrom, has diabetes and said she spends more than $7,000 in out-of-pocket expenses a year. Others on the trip, such as Nicole Smith-Holt, whose son Alec died after rationing his insulin, made the trip as a symbolic effort.\n\nAfter a five-hour car ride, the group walked into a pharmacy and came out with the medication they wanted -- many bought Novo Nordisks's NovoLog, labeled in Canada as NovoRapid, at $30, compared to the $289.36 list price in the United States, Nicholas writes.\n\nThe Fix's Amber Phillips on the standoff between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration and whether it could lead to impeachment proceedings:", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/4a5e209570161aab128904d6c2a80929-5472-3648-70-8-JBM5POTSUUI6THYGL7BO5AACPI.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4777981", "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 295185300}, {"uri": "1132326329", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-09", "time": "22:13:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-09T22:13:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/paloma/the-trailer/2019/05/09/the-trailer-trumpworld-s-plan-to-reelect-the-president/5cd2f3dba7a0a46cfe152c91/", "title": "Analysis | The Trailer: Trumpworld's plan to reelect the president", "body": "In this edition: The Trump battle plan, ad wars in North Carolina, and a new poll from the first primary state.\n\nEight Democratic candidates for president are polling at zero in New Hampshire, and this is The Trailer.\n\nThe president's Wednesday night rally in the Florida Panhandle ended without much of a theme. He took shots at Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke. He attacked China for its aggressive turn in trade negotiations, then shrugged that \"It'll work out.\" And he appeared to laugh when a crowd member yelled about shooting undocumented immigrants.\n\nWhat made less news but mattered much more for the president's reelection hopes was a pledge to redirect nearly half a billion more dollars toward hurricane recovery -- and a promise to rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base, damaged by last year's storms. That was exactly what the coalition working to reelect Trump wanted to hear: Every visit to a swing state, every offer of help from the government, could help them get reluctant voters excited about 2020. And Trump campaign representatives were working the rally, collecting data from attendees who might want to reelect the president.\n\nThe president's reelection campaign, which began on the day he was sworn in, is not built with the expectation of a landslide. Like Barack Obama's 2012 campaign, it's designed to grind out a win by identifying everyone who supports the president, getting them registered and active, and turning them out. The president won just 45.9 percent of the popular vote in 2016 but edged out wins in key states. The mission in 2020 is to do it again.\n\nAs Democrats debate what model can win in 2020 -- revving up their base? Convincing independents that Trump is an aberration? -- the Trump operation is sticking to what worked before. Trump allies believe they have a long head start on the Democrats, who only this year created an independent source for voter profiles, the Data Warehouse, modeled after the years-old Republican Data Trust.\n\nThe DNC is still recovering from the Obama-era mismanagement that ended with supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) accusing it of rigging the 2016 primary; the RNC, with the president's blessing on all of its small-donor pitches, has no such problems. As a candidate, Trump decried super PACs; as a president, he has blessed America First Action, a super PAC with plans to raise $300 million ahead of the election. The president himself had recently helped America First raise money; the president's supporters, Republicans say, do not care if he once attacked this sort of politics.\n\nSome prognosticators, looking at economic models, see a path to a Trump landslide. Trumpworld isn't that cocky; donors to America First Action are told that just 164 electoral votes are locked in for the president, while 13 states will see at least some kind of competition and spending. These are states -- Arizona, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania -- where the president got less than 52 percent of the vote in 2016. The AFA's goal is to spend $250 million on the last six states on that list, which have the most electoral votes.\n\nIn each state, the focus is entirely on hitting a turnout number. In Florida, for example, the starting Trumpworld assumption is that 10.5 million votes could be cast, which would represent record turnout in a fast-growing state. To be sure of a win, the president would need around 5.2 million to 5.3 million votes. At least 4.3 million Floridians, according to the campaign models, are already assured to come out for the president. The goal from there is straightforward: Find the 972,000-odd voters who would get the president to the win number.\n\n\"I believe that between the president holding rallies, Brad executing on his digital strategy, and Ronna and the DNC working on turnout, we can bridge that gap,\" said Brian O. Walsh, president of America First Policies. (Brad is Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale; Ronna is RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.)\n\nGetting those voters means persuading some holdouts, chiefly the ones who came out of 2016 disliking both Trump and Hillary Clinton. The sharpest tool for winning them over, Republicans say, is information about the president's lower-profile wins -- everything from anti-opioid legislation to projects such as rebuilding that Air Force base in the Panhandle.\n\nJust as many voters, though, might be found by converting nonvoters or infrequent voters into Trump supporters. Trumpworld, after a midterm that showed most suburban women could not be swayed to their side, was captivated by data that found the voters who dropped off the most from 2016 to 2018 were white men who lacked college degrees, a loyal section of the president's base.\n\nHundreds of thousands of voters who fit that profile, especially in states such as Florida, simply weren't registered. Tapping some of them had helped blow apart the Democrats' election models in 2016 and in some states in 2018 -- Democrats barely believed it possible to win Jacksonville's Duval County without winning the state. The new theory was that if the haphazard 2016 Trump campaign could activate some of these voters, a better-organized 2020 version could find them with months to spare.\n\nThe Democrats' busy presidential primary didn't affect these calculations, but its crowded nature both helps and hurts the Trump effort. Unlike in 2016, when Republicans inherited decades of messaging against Hillary Clinton, there is relatively little research yet on what attacks would work on the possible Democratic nominee.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden is seen as the candidate who would most credibly allow the president to run as a \"change agent,\" even from the Rose Garden; Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has touted internal polls that show him strong in the Midwest, is seen by Trumpworld as too far left to win, likely to alienate Democrats who are not comfortable with \"socialism,\" however defined.\n\nWith no obvious Democratic opponent, Trumpworld has been elevating Sanders and some of the left-wing House class. In 2016, famously, the president struggled to unite the kind of high-dollar Republican donors who'd backed other candidates in the primary or helped Mitt Romney compete with Obama. In 2019, the Trump allies working to win those donors were finding some of them rattled by the latest thing they'd heard from Sanders or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.); it was opening wallets faster than the president could get them to open on his own.\n\nThe campaign apparatus could take advantage of that, even if the president did not. In Florida, with the national media gathered to cover him, he did not take any swings at Sanders or the Democrats' left.\n\n\"Trump endorsed a super PAC supporting him -- and here's why that might not be a legal problem,\" by Michelle Ye Hee Lee\n\nCampaigns tend to be careful in how they describe their favored super PACs, as they are not allowed to coordinate with them. But a damaging story about a PAC that was diverting possible donations from the Trump campaign persuaded Trumpworld to clarify its favorite super PAC: America First Action.\n\n\"Wall Street Democrats Are Absolutely Freaking Out About Their 2020 Candidates,\" by Gabriel Debenedetti\n\nThe poll rise of Joe Biden has, perhaps temporarily, paused what was a running story among big Democratic donors -- panic about a more populist candidate seizing the nomination.\n\n\"As Warren and Trump team jockey on opioids, Democrats say president betrayed his base on a devastating addiction scourge,\" by Annie Linskey and Katie Zezima\n\nThe Trump campaign fully intends to tell voters that the president began solving the opioid crisis; Democrats don't plan to let him do it.\n\n\"Why Georgia's anti-abortion law is 'just the beginning,' \" by Greg Bluestein\n\nGeorgia's new law, which classifies abortion after six weeks of pregnancy as murder, goes further than any pre-Roe legislation.

Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) gave the International Association of Machinists a stemwinder about how the economy was failing them. As the congressman from eastern Ohio, as a candidate for president, he had seen this at the root: He had been pounding the Trump administration over policies that could not save a GM plant in Lordstown.\n\n\"How many times does this have to happen before we take over the economic and political system and make it work for us?\" Ryan asked.\n\nHours later, the president announced that he was going to save the Lordstown plant. Sort of. In a tweet later confirmed by GM, the president declared that the 6.2 million-square-foot plant might be taken over by Workhouse Group, a small Ohio company, thanks to his lobbying.\n\nRyan spent much of the day responding to what was initially seen as good news. In a video statement, Ryan called the deal \"bittersweet,\" assuming it went off at all. In a call with reporters, he was asked how, exactly, Democrats would campaign for replacing the president when the job market was so tight.\n\n\"Many of these people are underemployed,\" Ryan said. \"I'll give you a perfect example, in Trumbull County. We are losing 1,700 jobs, good-paying UAW jobs that have gone in the past two years. We have a TJX distribution center coming online, which will be a thousand jobs, but those jobs aren't going to pay as much. In the short term you're going to see job growth, but the issue is underemployment. ... I just think these old metrics, quite frankly, of unemployment rates and stock markets are way overblown today.\"\n\nThe No. 1 concern of the Trump reelection effort, the factor it can't control, is a slowdown in the economy. But if the economy grows at the current hot and steady pace, Democrats are stuck in the same position as Ryan -- arguing that the growth has not prevented decline outside big cities and suburbs, and that, anyway, the administration is taking credit for a trend it inherited.\n\n\"This is nine years into an economic expansion, seven of which happened under President Obama,\" said Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), who represents parts of Philadelphia. \"The average job growth per month isn't any better than the last couple of years of the Obama administration. So I'm glad that, even with all of Donald Trump's screw-ups, he has not screwed up this economic expansion.\"\n\nIn a memo obtained first by Politico, the Democratic National Committee has clarified the rules for cutting candidates out of its first two debates.\n\nAs previously announced, there will be two debates in prime time in June, on the 26th and 27th, in Miami. Each debate will feature up to 10 candidates; if more than 20 candidates qualify, the candidates with the lowest polling average (their best three polling results, divided by three, rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point) will be cut.\n\nAt the moment, three declared candidates for president have neither 65,000 donations (one way to make the debate) or any combination of polls putting them at 1 percent (the other method). They are: Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), and Miramar, Fla., Mayor Wayne Messam.\n\nNorth Carolina's 9th Congressional District. The Club for Growth's intervention in the nearby 3rd District didn't make much of a ripple, but its work here -- in a special election sparked by fraud allegations against a Republican campaign -- hits all the popular insurgent themes. In a new spot, the group hits Leigh Brown, a Realtor and first-time candidate. \"Brown attacked in the 2016 campaign. She wrote: Donald Trump, you're wrong.\"\n\nState Sen. Dan Bishop's own campaign has positioned him as the \"battle-tested conservative\" whose first priority in Washington will be to \"build President Trump's wall\"; his own ad, in rotation now, portrays Democrat Dan McCready as one of many \"clowns\" he's ready to fight, next to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). The May 14 primary is crowded, but Bishop and Brown have the airwaves almost to themselves.\n\nThis is Monmouth's first dip into the first primary state, and it finds a bigger cache of support for Biden than any other poll this year; it ends a string of polls that had put Sanders, the landslide winner of the 2016 New Hampshire primary, on top. The key: 68 percent of Democratic voters, when asked whether they want purity or electability, say they prefer the candidate they \"do not agree with but [is] stronger against Trump.\" The news cycle does not reward endless investigations of the same question, but \"electability\" remains a big enough driver to freeze this primary in place until and unless voters begin to see Biden as less electable.\n\nIt's been six months since anti-Trump Republicans began urging Hogan to consider running against the president, arguing that his bipartisan appeal in a blue state could be translated nationally. At one point, in a remarkable bit of wish-casting, New York Times columnist (and Maryland resident) David Brooks suggested that Hogan would be the party's 2020 nominee. That was hasty; Trump, who won 54 percent of the vote in 2016's three-way Maryland primary, does even better in a match-up with Hogan.\n\nAmy Klobuchar. This week, she became the second 2020 Democrat to hold a town hall on Fox News. She largely got to focus on her pitch as a pragmatic \"heartland\" candidate, but most follow-up questions she got were about whether Democrats had shifting standards for judging sexual misconduct, which led Klobuchar to defend her questioning during the Brett M. Kavanaugh hearings. \"He got a really good job out of the whole thing,\" she said. \"He's, like, on the Supreme Court of the United States.\"\n\nBernie Sanders. He told the International Association of Machinists that, as president, he'd put a moratorium on pension cuts; he then joined Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to introduce legislation that would cap credit card fees at 15 percent.\n\nJohn Hickenlooper. He's proposing a change to the attorney general's confirmation process, requiring 60 Senate votes for confirmation, limiting him or her to one term, and preventing him or her from being removed without cause.\n\nMarianne Williamson. She announced her 65,000th individual donation, qualifying her for a spot in the first presidential primary debates next month. \"Thank you to those of you who have seen the possibility of a new American beginning and have been willing to invest in its formation,\" she said. Eighteen Democrats have now said they have qualified for the debates; Williamson is the only one to have done so with donor totals only.\n\nJay Inslee. He announced a New Deal-styled \"climate conservation corps,\" the latest in the series of attempts to put climate at the center of a jobs plan.\n\nSeth Moulton. He tapped Marie Harf, a foreign policy veteran of the Obama administration and current Fox News commentator, as his deputy campaign manager for communications.\n\nOne of the advantages of being a front-runner in your primary is that your every utterance makes news. At a stop in Los Angeles with the city's mayor, Joe Biden took media questions for 15 minutes, some of them newsy (he agreed that undocumented immigrants were entitled to taxpayer-funded health care) and some speculative. What did he think of the risk of a drawn-out primary?\n\n\"What's going to happen is, this field is going to be winnowed out pretty quickly, here in California as well,\" Biden said. \"In order to get any delegates out of a congressional district, you need 15 percent of the vote. To come out of Iowa, you need 15 percent of a caucus. So it's going to work its way through relatively quickly.\"\n\nFor some reason, this made headlines around the country. But the point was obvious. To break it down a bit:\n\nBiden wasn't predicting that his own strength would winnow down the field. It's just how the primaries work; a handful of candidates will be able to carry on after New Hampshire. The \"brokered convention\" scenario doesn't assume that 23 candidates make it through June; it assumes that, for the first time since 1992, more than two candidates stick it out past Super Tuesday. And in 1992, that did not lead to a brokered convention.\n\nAlmost nothing seems to get Democratic voters thinking as seriously about the courts as Republican voters do, but it's worth watching the conservative movement's legal strategy for hints of a backlash. The GOP has been focused on appointing friendly judges, making sure unfriendly ones don't hamper their agenda and trying to get abortion cases to the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Wednesday, Vice President Pence told a meeting of the Federalist Society that it was time for district judges to stop issuing injunctions against regulations proposed by the executive branch.\n\n\"The Supreme Court of the United States must clarify that district judges can decide no more than the cases before them, and it's imperative that we restore the historic tradition that district judges do not set policy for the whole nation,\" Pence said. \"In the days ahead, our administration will seek opportunities to put this very question before the Supreme Court to ensure that decisions affecting every American are made either by those elected to represent the American people or by the highest court in the land.\"\n\nThis actually got less attention than the efforts by Republicans in Alabama and Georgia to pass stricter bans on abortion, with criminal penalties for women who got them, even if the procedures were performed out of state or the pregnancies the result of rape or incest. The intent behind these laws (and similar laws already passed in Ohio and Mississippi) is clear: to test whether the new Supreme Court would restrict abortion rights if a new case got to its docket.\n\nNone of this has really come up in the Democratic primary, so far; there's not much daylight between the candidates when it comes to appointing judges. But it's bubbling under, especially when the candidates engage on an electability question. And it complicates the abortion question that has been wrapping Democrats around their axels. In North Carolina and Montana, Republican legislatures have passed bills to strengthen antiabortion laws to protect \"born alive\" infants; Democratic governors have vetoed them. The plan had been to make Democrats pay for a politically untenable position, but that could be moot if the debate moves back to Roe.\n\n.\u2009.\u2009. 22 days until Democrats head to California for the state party convention\n\n.\u2009.\u2009. 44 days until Jim Clyburn's fish fry in South Carolina\n\n.\u2009.\u2009. 91 days until the start of the Iowa State Fair", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/3d7d47b90d29dda94ed202b914e78624-4500-3000-70-8-AFP_1GA7D9_tstmp_1557433472.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 295135980}, {"uri": "1131927386", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-09", "time": "12:26:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-09T12:26:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2019/05/09/the-health-202-trump-will-call-on-congress-to-protect-americans-from-surprise-medical-bills/5cd305d51ad2e506550b2fc5/", "title": "Analysis | The Health 202: Trump will call on Congress to protect Americans from surprise medical bills", "body": "President Trump walks to board Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House. (Al Drago/Bloomberg News)\n\nIn an address scheduled shortly before noon today, President Trump will call on Congress to pass legislation protecting Americans from the all-too-common problem of surprise medical bills, incurred after a patient receives care from a doctor who is outside his or her health plan's network.\n\nThe president -- who in January directed Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Labor Secretary Alex Acosta to pursue a fix -- is expected to lay out principles he wants upheld in any legislation on surprise billing Congress might consider, lobbyists and advocates confirmed to The Health 202.\n\nTrump's remarks come as a bipartisan group of six senators work to finalize a bill outlining how insurers and doctors should go about settling billing disputes resulting from out-of-network care. That effort is being led by Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and by Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), whose office confirmed she will attend today's address at the White House. The group is expected to roll out legislation by the end of May.\n\nLawmakers aren't targeting just any medical bills that catch people unaware. They are seeking to curtail medical bills widely regarded as truly unfair because patients couldn't avoid them despite their best efforts.\n\nEven when patients carefully select a hospital in their network, they may still end up receiving care during a hospital stay from a radiologist, anesthesiologist or pathologist who isn't part of their insurance's coverage network. As a result, they'll receive higher bills reflecting out-of-network rates -- charges that can amount to thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n\"The pricing is hurting patients, and we've stopped a lot of it, but we're going to stop all of it,\" Trump said during a January roundtable on the subject.\n\nJoe Grogan, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, told hospitals in March they had better address the problem or else expect action from policymakers and lawmakers.\n\n\"If hospitals, providers and issuers don't protect these patients from financial harm, Congress and the administration will need to act,\" Grogan said at the Federation of American Hospitals' annual conference.\n\nInsurers, doctors and hospitals all publicly say they agree that patients should be protected from these kinds of charges. But the effort sets up a potential fight among different stakeholders, as they each try to duck the extra costs that would be shifted away from patients.\n\nBoth providers and insurers agree there should be a process to determine payment rates. The goal here is to bridge the gap between the charge from a hospital or doctor and what insurers say they're willing to pay for out-of-network care. But there are a few different ways to get there.\n\n-- Several previous bills have proposed an arbitration process, where an impartial arbiter examines the figures presented by each side and selects one as the final payment. Proponents of this approach point to New York's baseball-style arbitration process in place since 2015, which has prompted a major decline in out-of-network medical bills in the state.\n\n-- Another approach is to set a fixed standard in which out-of-network care would be reimbursed at a rate such as 125 percent of Medicare rates, or the 80th percentile of rates paid by commercial plans.\n\n-- Some economists have also suggested that bundling payments for hospitals and their on-site doctors could help solve the problem.\n\nThe trick with all these possible approaches is to make sure the payments aren't set too high, which could incentivize doctors to leave a hospital's network, nor too low, to ensure providers still get adequately compensated and that insurers don't gain too much leverage.\n\nAmerica's Health Insurance Plans, the major health insurers association, favors a set payment method, warning that an arbitration process could lead to higher premiums. Doctors appear favorably inclined to both methods, but they've stress that insurers should be required to contract with a sufficient number of doctors and specialists -- a further way to shield patients from encountering an out-of-network physician during a hospital stay.\n\n\"Overly narrow provider networks -- particularly those that lack sufficient numbers of specialists -- are a major factor in unanticipated billing,\" Barbara McAneny, president of the American Medical Association, wrote in an op-ed published Tuesday by the Hill.\n\nAHH: Drugmakers will be required to display the list price of medications in television advertisements, according to a rule finalized yesterday by HHS. The advertisements must also display the sentence \"If you have health insurance that covers drugs, your cost may be different,\" as an acknowledgment that list prices are usually much higher than what insured consumers must pay out-of-pocket for their medications. It will apply to medicines that cost more than $35 for a month supply.\n\nThe regulation, which the pharmaceutical industry decried yesterday, is among a basket of steps the Trump administration is taking to improve transparency in the drug pricing system and put pressure on drugmakers to ease their prices.\n\n\"Requiring drug companies to level with American patients about their prices is about working toward a system where the patient -- not the insurer, not the drug company, not the government but the patient -- is the one in control of her health care,\" Azar told reporters.\n\nOOF: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said she would donate the $4,500 in campaign contributions she has previously accepted from the prominent Sackler family, which owns one of the country's top opioid manufacturers, Purdue Pharma.\n\nIn a Medium post announcing a plan to use $100 billion in federal funding to address the opioid epidemic, Warren criticized the family and its role in the crisis.\n\n\"The opioid epidemic teaches us that too often in America today, if you have money and power, you can take advantage of everyone else without consequence. I think it's time to change that,\" she wrote. \"That's the America we deserve ... An America where, when people like the Sacklers destroy millions of lives to make money, they don't get museum wings named after them, they go to jail.\"\n\nIt's not clear to what groups Warren will donate the funds, the Wall Street Journal's Joshua Jamerson reports, adding the Massachusetts Democrat has received money from numerous members of the family going back to 2012.\n\n-- Warren's $100 billion plan to tackle the opioid epidemic is also an \"eye-catching amount that reflects a broader strategy by Democrats to focus on issues important to President Trump's base where they say he has fallen short,\" our Post colleagues Annie Linskey and Katie Zezima report.\n\nYesterday the Trump administration released a report listing action it has taken to address the opioid crisis, including securing $6 billion in funding from Congress, upping the number of prosecutions of fentanyl traffickers and increasing the availability of medication-assisted treatments and overdose-reversing medication. James Carroll, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, claimed \"significant progress\" in combating the epidemic.\n\n\"The spotlight thrown on the topic by leaders of both parties shows the potency of addiction as a political issue and the continued impact of an overdose crisis that resulted in roughly 70,000 deaths in 2017, most of them from opioids,\" Annie and Katie write.\n\nBut in an interview, Warren insisted Trump \"has been all talk and no action\" and dismissed a question about whether the Trump administration has increased attention on opioids. \"It doesn't matter if you don't back it up with real resources and help for the people who need it,\" Warren said. \"He hasn't made it a priority.\"\n\nOUCH: People living in rural areas are increasingly responsible for the rise in global obesity rates. Our Post colleague William Wan reports a consortium of researchers found in the past three decades, the global rise in obesity has mostly been propelled by unhealthy weight gain in rural pockets, rather than in urban areas.\n\n\"The study -- a massive collaboration by more than 1,000 researchers, drawing on more than 2,000 studies of 200 countries -- found that more than 55 percent of the global increase in body mass index in the past 30 years has come from rural populations,\" he reports. \"The trend was even sharper in low- and middle-income countries, with more than 80 percent of the worsening BMI driven by rural populations.\"\n\nBarry M. Popkin, a University of North Carolina food science researcher who was not involved in the new study, told William: \"It means we need to think of policies that address rural areas or have an effect in rural and urban areas equally. We can't just ignore it anymore.\"\n\n-- Robert Pear, a 40-year veteran of the New York Times and relentless health-care reporter, died this week at age 69. He was, as our Post colleague Emily Langer writes, \"one of the most relentlessly probing journalists on the health-care beat, enlightening readers and rankling partisans with the clarity of his reportage and his savantlike understanding of the federal government and its arcana. With a seemingly ever-present byline on Page One of the Times, Mr. Pear was a constant and authoritative presence in Washington for four decades.\"\n\nAs the New York Times's Sam Roberts writes, Pear tenaciously pursued scoop after scoop, and in the course of more than 6,700 Times articles \"went about his reporting meticulously and, to the wider public, inconspicuously.\" In his memory, the New York Times is retiring the slug \"HEALTH,\" because as editors said: \"it can only be by Pear.\"\n\nMany in the health-care industry, fellow reporters and lawmakers reacted to Pear's death, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.):\n\nAndy Slavitt, who headed CMS under President Barack Obama:\n\n-- Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee batted down a Republican effort to block funding to entities that provide abortions unless certain requirements were met related to babies born alive after attempted abortions, as our Post colleague Erica Werner reports.\n\nThe 23-29 defeat of the amendment by Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) followed impassioned remarks from Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) in support of the measure. She detailed how multiple health-care providers told her to end her pregnancy with her first child, now 6 years-old, who was born without her kidneys. Her first daughter, Abigail, is now doing well and Herrera Beutler is expecting her third child this month.\n\n\"I just think how many other instances are there?\" the Washington Republican told the committee. \"Most of these are moms who want these babies. They're not wanting to terminate late because they didn't want the pregnancies, it's because there's a problem and they were told there's no chance.\"\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) dismissed the Republican effort as a \"ruse to ban safe and legal abortion in the United States.\"\n\n-- Later in the day, the House Appropriations Committee also voted to block a new Trump administration rule aimed at protecting health-care providers, insurers and employers who object to providing or paying for services like abortion that violate religious beliefs.\n\n\"The measure by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) would prevent spending to implement the new rule, which Trump announced last week during a speech before faith leaders,\" Erica writes. Lee's amendment passed on a 30-23 vote along party lines.\n\n\"This dangerous and discriminatory rule attempts to enshrine discrimination in virtually all facets of health care by granting new rights to those who believe their personal beliefs should determine the care a patient receives,\" Lee said. Meanwhile, Republicans called Lee's measure a \"poison pill\" that would hinder passage of the broader spending bill being debated.\n\n-- And the full Democrat-led House plans to vote today on a bill blocking HHS from granting states Affordable Care Act waivers that could make way for some health plans with fewer protections for individuals with preexisting conditions. The White House threatened to veto it.\n\nIn a policy statement threatening a veto, the White House suggested the bill's title -- the Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019 -- was \"misleading.\" \"This bill would not extend any additional protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Rather, it would harm the ability of States to improve coverage for people both with and without pre-existing conditions,\" the statement read.\n\nIn response, Protect Our Care chair Leslie Dach also pointed to Republican efforts to undermine the health-care law and its protections for people with preexisting conditions, including a GOP-backed lawsuit aiming to invalidate the ACA: \"[T]he record shows they'll do everything they can to let insurance companies gut coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions.\"\n\n-- Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s own family is calling out his anti-vaccine views, as the United States grapples with its worst measles outbreak in years that's been in part blamed on the spread of misinformation.\n\nIn a piece published in Politico Magazine, Kennedy's brother former congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-Mass.), sister Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and niece Maeve Kennedy McKean lament the growing number of measles cases that are \"amplified by internet doomsayers.\"\n\n\"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ... is part of this campaign to attack the institutions committed to reducing the tragedy of preventable infectious diseases,\" they write. \"He has helped to spread dangerous misinformation over social media and is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind vaccines.\"\n\nThe trio express their love for Kennedy and praise his work in other areas. \"He is one of the great champions of the environment... However, on vaccines he is wrong\"\n\n-- Shelters at the U.S. border are bursting at the seams after thousands of migrant families have come seeking asylum. For example, one 66,000-square-foot space to house migrants in Tucson is full, the Wall Street Journal's Alicia A. Caldwell reports.\n\n\"The border has seen illegal-immigrant waves before. This one is different,\" Alicia writes. \"Instead of the single job seekers of a decade ago who aimed to sneak in undetected, these are families openly seeking asylum -- more like the groups of refugees familiar on borders elsewhere in the world, where wars, famine and genocide have created massive camps of displaced families with nowhere to go.\"\n\nThis fiscal year, about 248,000 parents and children crossed illegally into the country by April -- more than had done so in any prior full year, according to federal data.\n\nA tent city has opened in Donna, Tex., in the latest effort to house migrant families, but Alicia writes such facilities are only meant to temporarily house 500 family members and unaccompanied minors and \"won't make a dent in the crisis.\"\n\n\"A Homeland Security Advisory Council in a report last month recommended construction of more permanent regional processing centers,\" she adds. \"Without legal changes, they are 'nothing but a welcoming center and will have no impact on stemming the flow of these family units coming across the border in these remote locations,' said Karen Tandy, chairwoman of the Homeland Security Advisory Council panel that produced the report, who headed the Drug Enforcement Administration under President George W. Bush.\"\n\n-- And here are a few more good reads from The Post and beyond:\n\nToday\n\nPresident Trump made a joke when a supporter at his Florida rally reportedly suggested migrants crossing the Southern border should be shot:", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/ea006a9fa146cfd4987c00f36916dc19-2256-1504-70-8-VAKU4XDR3MI6THYGL7BO5AACPI.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4777981", "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 295100760}, {"uri": "1131484900", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-08", "time": "23:53:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-08T23:53:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitch-mcconnell-wants-to-raise-money-off-the-nickname-cocaine-mitch-yes-really/2019/05/08/2ae6b6d4-71ca-11e9-9eb4-0828f5389013_story.html", "title": "Mitch McConnell wants to raise money off the nickname 'Cocaine Mitch.'

Behind him, a dusting of cocaine coronates the likeness of an apparent drug kingpin. The back of the shirt declares the wearer a \"cartel member.\"\n\nBut the man on the shirt is no Pablo Escobar. It's Cocaine Mitch -- a.k.a. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose status as the Senate majority leader makes him one of the most powerful politicians in the country.\n\nAnd the shirt is no attack ad. No, it's the newest, hottest-selling item on McConnell's campaign website, where supporters can buy one for $35. The senator's campaign celebrated the shirt's virality on Wednesday by tweeting a GIF that showed stacks of money being counted. They were moving a lot of product.\n\nMcConnell and his campaign's embrace of the nickname is an attempted reclamation of a moniker once deployed against them. Roughly a year ago, GOP Senate candidate from West Virginia and former coal magnate Don Blankenship aired a campaign advertisement that referred to McConnell, without any context, as \"Cocaine Mitch.\" It was an apparent nod to a years-old allegation that the family of McConnell's wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, has a shipping background connected to drug dealers.\n\nThe Washington Post's Fact Checker has debunked this claim and awarded it \"Four Pinnochios,\" meaning Blankenship had absolutely no evidence to support his peculiar assertion.\n\n[The kooky tale of 'Cocaine Mitch']\n\nBut in the months since that ad aired -- and Blankenship lost his primary race -- McConnell and his campaign have repeatedly adopted the name. It's a sign of the senator's good humor, his willingness to take a joke, said Josh Holmes, McConnell's former chief of staff.\n\n\"This all stems from Senator McConnell having a pretty good sense of humor for what, at the time, was a pretty slanderous attack,\" Holmes said. \"It sort of became an online alter ego for Senator McConnell. .\u2009.\u2009. Supporters have rallied around it and love it.\"\n\nBut some policy experts have criticized McConnell and his campaign for selling products that reference and, they say, make light of drug issues.\n\n\"There's something troubling about a politician raising money in this way when so many people are languishing in prison for harsh penalties related to cocaine and other drugs,\" said Michael Collins, the director of Drug Policy Alliance's national affairs office.\n\nAnother critic, Eric Conrad, who has worked for Democratic campaigns, pointed out an apparent double-standard in McConnell's promotion of the Cocaine Mitch brand, writing on Twitter that conservatives like McConnell also typically favor harsher penalties for drug offenses.\n\nMcConnell's campaign responded, writing, \"If we sell enough #CocaineMitch shirts, we'll buy you a sense of humor.\"\n\nBut Andrew Kessler, who founded Sling Shot Solutions, a firm that specializes in behavior health policy, wasn't laughing when he first saw the shirt.\n\n\"One-hundred-ninety-two people die every day from a drug overdose,\" Kessler said, citing government data. \"I'm sorry if my sense of humor is not shining through.\"\n\nKentucky, in particular, has been hard hit with a wave of overdose deaths, fueled in large part by the opioid epidemic. In 2017, McConnell's home state had among the highest age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths in the country, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\n\"It shows me that he is not taking the problem of our current overdose epidemic seriously,\" Kessler said. \"It would be bad enough if he were saying it as Senate majority leader, but to be from Kentucky and doing that, it's reprehensible.\"\n\nBut Holmes said there's no question about where McConnell stands on drug policy.\n\n\"I don't think anyone has done more for fighting drug addiction than Senator McConnell has,\" he said.\n\nAnd his supporters, Holmes contended, recognize the irony in the shirts.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Wednesday she wants to use $100 billion in federal funds to address the opioid crisis, an eye-catching amount that reflects a broader strategy by Democrats to focus on issues important to President Trump's base where they say he has fallen short.\n\nThe Trump administration, meanwhile, released a report highlighting the actions it has taken to combat opioid addiction, including securing $6 billion in congressional funding, increasing prosecutions of those who traffic fentanyl, and expanding the availability of a drug used to reverse overdoses.\n\nThe spotlight thrown on the topic by leaders of both parties shows the potency of addiction as a political issue and the continued impact of an overdose crisis that resulted in roughly 70,000 deaths in 2017, most of them from opioids. It also underlines the ongoing battle to appeal to white working-class voters, a group that was critical to Trump's 2016 victory and that Democrats hope to court.\n\nMost Democrats believe their path to the White House involves winning back industrial states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania whose populations have been badly hurt by addiction, and they see the opioid crisis as way to expose a gap between the president's rhetoric and his record.\n\n\"Trump has been all talk and no action,\" said Warren in a brief interview Wednesday about her opioid plan.\n\nShe waved off a question about whether the president, who campaigned on solving the opioid crisis, had at least focused attention on the issue. \"It doesn't matter if you don't back it up with real resources and help for the people who need it,\" Warren said. \"He hasn't made it a priority.\"\n\nThe Trump camp would disagree.\n\nAdministration officials say they have made the opioid crisis a signature issue, with the president declaring opioids a public health emergency and first lady Melania Trump highlighting the crisis. Trump appointed a commission in 2017 that made 56 recommendations on combating the scourge.\n\nThe administration has also successfully prodded China to tighten its regulation of fentanyl-related substances. The synthetic opioid is now driving overdose deaths, and most of the illicit fentanyl coming to the United States is manufactured in China.\n\n\"From day one, our mission has been the same -- to save more of our family members, friends and neighbors dying from drug overdoses,\" James Carroll, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, said in a statement.\n\nTrump has also stoked controversy by urging the death penalty for drug dealers, an idea many experts say would do little to stop illegal drug use. And he has made the opioid crisis part of his push for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, though most illicit drugs come through legal ports of entry.\n\nWednesday's announcements come as the presidential field has recently expanded to include former vice president Joe Biden, who argues that he can connect with white working-class voters who flocked to Trump.\n\nHealth experts say Washington's fight against opioids has largely amounted to symbolism or tinkering, and that it has not allocated nearly enough money. Trump's emergency declaration increased awareness but did not result in additional funding.\n\nLeo Beletsky, a law and health sciences professor at Northeastern University, said the federal response to the opioid crisis has been \"abysmal.\" Warren's proposed $100 billion is closer to what is needed, he said, but there should be more explicit attention to structural changes, such as integrating addiction treatment into mainstream medical care.\n\nStill, Warren's approach would be an improvement over Trump's, he said. \"The Trump administration has in many ways fumbled this issue,\" he added. \"It's been primarily rhetoric and not really action.\"\n\nWarren's plan is modeled after the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act, which is credited with stanching the AIDS crisis, at least in the short run. The plan has interested policy experts largely because of the price tag: It's big enough to make a difference in an epidemic that has yet to crest, they say.\n\nWarren has proposed paying for her measure with a new annual tax on the country's wealthiest individuals, which she also wants to use to finance other priorities, including universal child care, canceling billions in student debt, and making tuition free for public colleges and universities.\n\nAs part of her announcement Wednesday, Warren said she would return the $4,500 in political donations from the Sackler family that she has received since 2012. The family controls Purdue Pharma, which manufactures the opioid painkiller OxyContin.\n\nPurdue is facing a cascade of lawsuits alleging that the drugmaker helped drive the opioid crisis, including by aggressively and deceptively marketing OxyContin. The Sackler family has been the subject of lawsuits by attorneys general in New York and Massachusetts. The company and the family deny the allegations.\n\nA spokesman for the Sackler family said that Warren's decision to return the money \"can serve no proper political purpose\" and that the family instead would \"welcome a genuine dialogue with the senator that's fact-based.\"\n\nWarren will highlight her announcement Friday with a visit to Kermit, W.Va., a town of about 400 known as a center of the crisis. It was inundated with about 9 million hydrocodone tablets in a two-year period, according to Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting by the Charleston Gazette.\n\nWarren has made a habit of traveling beyond the early primary states, taking her message to Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee in recent weeks. In the next few days she'll also campaign in Ohio.\n\nHer pitch on opioids goes beyond the white communities that have been devastated by the scourge. She makes a point of noting that residents of majority-black cities struggled with heroin long before the epidemic reached rural America.\n\n\"The crisis has also severely impacted communities of color, exacerbated by existing health disparities,\" Warren said in a post published Wednesday on Medium. In 2017, she said, Baltimore had 692 opioid-related deaths, not far below the 833 in all of West Virginia.\n\nWarren is not the only presidential candidate to see a political vulnerability for Trump on opioids.\n\nSen.

Mueller III's investigation -- over his involvement in a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer who promised dirt on the Hillary Clinton campaign.

Yet in Mueller's report, the president's former lawyer Michael Cohen said that he recalled being in Trump's office when Trump Jr. told him about a meeting to get \"adverse information\" on Clinton.

Many top members of the administration also attended, including Vice President Pence, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House adviser Kellyanne Conway.\n\n[Trump defends administration's response to opioid crisis: 'We will never stop until our job]\n\nBe Best, in addition to online safety, has two other pillars: children's social and emotional well-being and opioid abuse. The first lady has focused on the babies born to addicts, but now she will expand her opioid work to \"include kids of all ages.\"\n\nOne memorable moment during the 45-minute event was when Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, took the microphone and urged parents to vaccinate their children.\n\n\"Get them to get their shots!\" Collins said emphatically. Measles was basically eliminated in the United States years ago, but recently the disease has spread in areas where parents have not vaccinated their children.\n\nMicrosoft's Toni Townes-Whitley spoke about making parents more aware of \"family settings\" they can use to limit screen time and promote \"digital civility.\"\n\nAnd, Sinclair TV personality Eric Bolling, whose son died of an accidental opioid overdose, lavished praise on Melania Trump. He said she has saved lives by talking about opioid abuse, including at large events with him. Bolling, formerly of Fox News, called her \"the most important and accomplished first lady in American history. Full stop.\" That immediately set off a heated online debate of what first lady was the \"most important and accomplished,\" with comparisons drawn from Eleanor Roosevelt to Hillary Clinton.\n\nMaryAnne Borrelli, a professor of government at Connecticut College, said there is \"power intrinsic to the office\" of the first lady, but there has been considerable variation in how presidential spouses have used it from Pat Nixon to Michelle Obama.\n\n\"It varies and it's not linear,\" she said.\n\nBalloons at the Be Best celebration at the White House.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nSo far, Melania Trump has kept a relatively light publicity schedule, but many first ladies became more active in their second term. Laura Bush, for instance, made most of her international trips during her husband's second term, visiting 67 countries.\n\nTrump made one solo foreign trip last year -- along with accompanying her husband on others -- and took 15 trips within the United States. And more trips are planned, she said.\n\nBut at least so far, Be Best is not as widely understood as several past East Wing initiatives -- and even its name is puzzling to many.\n\nTo carry out her large mandate, Melania Trump also runs an unusually small office with only 12 employees. She announced Tuesday that she had appointed a \"Be Best ambassador\" from USAID, the international aid agency, and called on other government agencies to appoint an ambassador \"to better highlight and promote the programs and services offered to parents and children.\"\n\nOnline bullying continues to be a huge issue. About 15 percent of high school students said they were they were bullied through Instagram, Facebook, texting or other social media sometime in the past 12 months, according to a 2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.\n\nJustin Patchin, a director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor at University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, said he doesn't really hear much about Be Best.\n\n\"I am not entirely sure what it is,\" he said in a phone interview, adding that what is really needed is money for research into the best programs and methods to curb online bullying.\n\nPatchin said all over the country parents ask what they can do when \"high-profile individuals\" not only call others names online but gain popularity by doing it.\n\n\"I don't want to get political but I just say, 'Look, this is an opportunity for parents to say these kinds of things that are being said -- whether it's by the president, other politicians or other famous people -- and if it's hurtful, if it's mean-spirited, if it's disrespectful, that's not how we treat other people,'\" he said. \"We shouldn't denigrate them.\"\n\nMany on the front lines of the opioid crisis, while welcoming the attention from the first lady and the president, say the focus needs to shift from raising awareness to treatment and how to pay for it.\n\nNearly 48,000 Americans -- about 130 people every day -- died from overdosing on heroin, fentanyl and other opioids in 2017, according to the most recent CDC figures.\n\nBut instead of expanding health coverage for costly addiction treatments, many states and federal health programs are contracting.\n\n\"There is a lot this administration could be doing,\" said Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University.\n\nAsked before the event whether there would be new funding for Be Best, Stephanie Grisham, the first lady's spokeswoman, said \"a successful campaign doesn't always mean spending money.\"\n\n\"There are amazing and successful companies, programs and services already out there. They just need to be highlighted, promoted and replicated -- and that is what Be Best will focus on in its second year,\" she said.\n\nThe program ended when a Minnesota high school robotics team was applauded for building a motorized wheelchair for 5-year-old Rocco Zachow, who cannot walk.\n\nAnd, then the speakers were led to the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden for a reception of lemonade, cookies and lawn games for the children present.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-QmZbti5FFWfWCztTmeUC6S6X4E=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/53XFQUTQ5YI6TEZRGC6FQNXURY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4772911", "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 294963420}, {"uri": "1127346816", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-03", "time": "13:49:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-03T13:49:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/05/03/i-was-meth-addict-thief-today-im-being-honored-by-fbi/", "title": "Perspective | I was a meth addict and a thief.

(Defy Ventures) By Ed Kressy May 3 at 8:00 AM\n\nFor 11 years, I was addicted to methamphetamine. Here's how it went for me:\n\nI thought the FBI was after me, dedicating all available resources to my pursuit. In my mind, an invisible stealth bomber often hovered above me in the San Francisco fog. My family and friends were also spying on me, using cutting-edge military technology to beam disembodied voices at me. Doctored pictures of me had appeared in a Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. This was part of a vast FBI operation with me at its nexus.\n\nLooking back, I think the meth might have had something to do with these thoughts.\n\nOnce, after I'd been arrested attempting to break in to my relatives' home to steal valuables for drug money, I refused to cooperate with police -- instead demanding an audience with the FBI. Cops put me in a locked psychiatric ward for my own protection.\n\nI became a meth addict despite many opportunities I had in life. I earned a college degree and had a successful biotech career. I owned a home in San Francisco, worked for Stanford University (Stanford fired me for violating an arcane Ivy-League-of-the-west tradition that you're expected to show up for work, not hide at home smoking meth.)\n\nDespite my fortunes, in October 2007 I'd sunk low. I hadn't showered or brushed my teeth in months. Mealtimes, I gobbled grub at soup kitchens, shoplifted from supermarkets or used fraudulently obtained food stamps to buy steaks to trade with my dealer for meth. My single-room-occupancy hotel -- sometimes known as a \"flophouse\" -- was evicting me. I was racing toward homelessness, incarceration and possibly the grave.\n\nInstead, at rock bottom, I decided to quit drugs for good. But I discovered that just because you're done with meth doesn't mean meth is done with you.\n\nEven after I stopped using, I sometimes feared the FBI SWAT team would kick down my door and send me to prison for life.\n\nFortunately, help soon arrived. Family, friends and compassionate people inspired me to return to society. Part of that return included giving back to my community by way of volunteering for the Red Cross and for a neighborhood political campaign. Once I began to do that, I felt a shift: Before, I cared mostly about what I could take. As I started to give, I realized it felt good. Strengthened by others' faith in me, even though I had little faith in myself, I began to work hard at working hard.\n\nSoon, the soup kitchen where I used to eat allowed me to volunteer preparing meals for the homeless. An officer of the San Francisco Police Department I used to dread became my 12-step sponsor to help me stay clean. The Toastmasters club where I'd once shown up for free dinner, only to walk out before the meeting began, allowed me to become a member, and after a time, miraculously, its president.\n\nAfter some training, the emergency services sector allowed me to become a volunteer first responder. Me, who used to carry a loaded pistol for protection against people I thought were after me. The San Francisco Fire Department provided hundreds of hours of disaster response training, which I supplemented by earning an EMT certification.\n\nYet all the while, fears of the FBI dogged me. Nights alone in my room, I grappled with dark certainties the Bureau was steps away from ending life as I knew it.\n\nAs part of my self-improvement, I was taking self-defense classes, and I'd become an instructor of Krav Maga, the Israeli self-defense system. I discovered one of my Krav students just so happened to be an FBI SWAT agent. I'd made him aware I participated in fire department emergency training and that I was interested in volunteering for the FBI, too. This was a big step in facing my angst.\n\nOne day after a combat cardio class I'd taught he asked me, \"Ed, would you be interested in organizing an unarmed self-defense session for our team?\"\n\nThat's how, in March 2015, I finally found myself face-to-face with a cadre of real FBI SWAT team agents.\n\nThe irony was not lost on me that for over a decade, I'd been held hostage by terror, the victim of my own mistakes. Yet there I was, freeing myself by volunteering for the bureau. I was helping the very people -- the SWAT team -- I had feared most.\n\nIt was a day of strange turns for me, including when one of the agents, a team lead, offered to sponsor me if I wanted to apply to the FBI Citizens Academy, a selective volunteer program that aims to strengthen relationships with minority groups, faith-based organizations, civic groups and others. It is a six-week series of classes and activities to give community leaders an inside look at the FBI. If anyone needed a greater understanding of the role of federal law enforcement, it was me. I applied.\n\nI was turned down. This happened two more times, but I persevered. My fourth application was finally accepted. (I later learned those rejections were probably due to simple administrative processes.)\n\nIn the days leading up to the Citizens Academy, I waited for the FBI's email saying my acceptance was a mistake. The email never arrived and the academy began. Along with my fellow academy-goers -- mostly tech workers, public safety and community leaders -- we took classes to learn about the FBI. One sunny Saturday we even went to an outdoor tactical range to observe demonstrations, including a bomb disposal.\n\nBut the best part? When I received my diploma on May 15, 2018 -- signed by FBI Director Christopher A. Wray and accompanied by his letter requesting that I, as a Citizens Academy alumnus, serve as an ambassador for the bureau. Me, a former meth addict who once lived in the underworld of drugs and thievery, an FBI ambassador.\n\nIt was hard to believe, but it gets even better.\n\nSix months later, I was invited to speak at a screening of \"Chasing the Dragon,\" a film created by the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration to combat the opioid epidemic (each day in the United States, more than 130 people die from overdosing on opioids). The screening was in November 2018 in Palo Alto, where my old employer Stanford is located. Both the mayor and the chief of police were in attendance. I spoke about my drug abuse, the root causes of addiction, and why I believe positive interactions between addicts and police can help make a dent in the addiction epidemic.\n\nI am now 49 years old, and the next chapters of my story are still to be written.\n\nBut today something monumental is happening: At the D.C. headquarters of the FBI, Wray will present me with the FBI Director's Community Leadership Award for work I've done helping people reintegrate into society after being released from prison. It's connected to work I do with Defy Ventures, a nonprofit providing employment training to people in prison, or those recently released.\n\nThe award recognizes 57 Americans each year, one from each FBI Field Office and the Criminal Justice Information Services Division. Past honorees have educated the public about Muslim culture, founded LGBT community centers and given urban youth alternatives to gangs.\n\nI'm beyond grateful to the FBI and many others for taking a chance on me and helping with my transformation. What I've learned on my path from meth addict, through mental health challenges and finally to community servant is that when people in need are given the right help, we are capable of giving back. And we want to.\n\nToday, one of the least likely people to be receiving a community service award from the director of the FBI will indeed receive it. And let me tell you with extreme certainty: If someone like me can come this far, in your life, anything is possible, too.\n\nEd Kressy is a writer, speaker and volunteer whose work serves addicts and people with criminal histories.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThe Trump administration is making it a top priority to protect doctors, hospitals or other medical providers who object on a moral or religious basis to providing services like abortion, sterilization or assisted suicide.\n\nIn a 440-page rule issued yesterday, the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Health and Human Services said it will use a broader array of tools to enforce more than two dozen \"conscience protection\" laws, some that have been on the books since the 1970s.\n\nThe move was lauded by social conservatives, who have grown to regard President Trump as a close ally for his vocal opposition to abortion rights and other issues dear to them. The president announced the new rule during a midday Rose Garden address timed with the National Day of Prayer.\n\n\"Just today we finalized new protections of conscience rights for physicians, pharmacists, nurses, teachers, students and faith-based charities,\" Trump said. \"They've been wanting to do that for a long time.\"\n\nThe rule, which details how HHS will define religious discrimination and how it will investigate such complaints, is the result of a months-long effort by OCR Director Roger Severino to reshape Obama-era policies in ways that are more favorable to conservatives.\n\nUnder the rule, the administration said it will actively enforce not just three but 25 conscience protection laws, and it drew much broader perimeters around what services providers could opt out of and who is eligible for the protections.\n\nSeverino said beefed-up enforcement is necessary because the office received 343 conscience-related complaints in the last fiscal year, an influx compared with an average of 125 complaints each year under the Obama administration.\n\n\"The rule broadly defines, or in some cases redefines, key terms in the law such as discrimination, referrals and what it means to assist in a procedure,\" my Washington Post colleagues Ariana Eunjung Cha, Sarah Pulliam Bailey and Amy Goldstein report. \"It also meticulously lays out religious exemptions in detail, both in terms of the types of workers that are covered and specific situations that might arise.\"\n\nIt also requires health-care entities to maintain records and report and cooperate with OCR requests. These new mechanisms, Severino said, will ensure \"Congress's protections are not just empty words on paper.\"\n\nThe rule prompted a flurry of response in Washington yesterday, with Democrats and liberals charging that it would undermine care for women and transgender people. Louise Melling, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, told me the rule is a signal \"to encourage people who want to refuse to provide abortion and other health-care services.\"\n\n\"I also think it will have a chilling effect on health-care providers who want to provide those services,\" Melling said.\n\nCommunications adviser to California Attorney General Xavier Becerra:\n\nThe Center for American Progress's Faith and Progressive Policy Initiative:\n\nThe National Women's Law Center:\n\nYet in the past, members of Congress -- including many Democrats -- have passed multiple laws saying individuals or entities shouldn't have to be involved in medical procedures or administer medications to which they're morally opposed. The 25 laws HHS is proposing to enforce include:\n\n-- The Church Amendments, passed by Congress back in the 1970s. The amendments ensure hospitals can't lose their Medicare or Medicaid funds if they refuse to provide abortions or sterilizations based on religious belief or moral conviction.\n\n-- Under the 1996 Coats-Snowe Amendment, federal, state and local governments can't exclude physicians or medical students from public funding or deny them licensing or certifications because they refused to be trained in providing abortions.\n\n-- And the Weldon Amendment, attached to government appropriations bills since 2004, says the government can't discriminate against providers or insurers for refusing to provide, refer for or pay for abortions.\n\nThese provisions, and others, are among the laws OCR says it can enforce more vigorously under the rule finalized yesterday.\n\n\"This rule ensures that government entities don't bully providers out of the practice of medicine, which would result in fewer health-care options,\" Severino told reporters yesterday.\n\nThe last two presidential administrations before Trump issued their own interpretation of how they would -- and wouldn't -- enforce \"conscience protection\" laws.\n\nGeorge W. Bush's administration beefed up and broadened enforcement of some of these laws in a 2008 rule, which allowed OCR to cut off federal funding to state and local government, hospitals, health plans and clinics if they didn't accommodate doctors, nurses or pharmacists who refused to participate in care to which they had religious or moral objections.\n\nThe Bush-era rule also required health-care entities to formally detail how they were complying with federal \"conscience protection\" laws. And it allowed providers to conscientiously object to providing not just abortion and sterilization procedures but contraception too.\n\nA few years later the Obama administration rewrote the rules, characterizing them as too broad. But it still retained protections for doctors and nurses refusing to perform abortions or sterilizations and left in place a process for health workers whose rights are violated to file complaints.\n\nAHH: The Food and Drug Administration announced it would not ban a type of breast implant that has been linked to a rare cancer, following an impassioned hearing in March during which several women demanded the agency take action.\n\nThe agency said it doesn't believe the product \"meets the legal standard for being banned at this time,\" as our Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports. FDA instead said it would bolster efforts to collect and share information about risks involved with the implants.\n\nA specific type of textured implant has been banned or restricted in some other countries due to concerns about breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or BIA-ALCL. The FDA said these specific devices make up only 10 percent or fewer of the implants sold in the United States. The agency had identified 457 cases of the implant-related lymphoma as of Sept. 30 and nine deaths worldwide.\n\nThe FDA said it is \"considering requiring implants to carry what's called a boxed warning -- the agency's strongest safety warning. And it may require doctors and patients to sign checklists of risks to make sure women have the necessary information to make an informed decision,\" as Laurie writes.\n\nOOF: A Democrat in Alabama's House is drawing criticism for his remarks following the passage of a measure making it a felony to perform an abortion at any stage in pregnancy, as our Post colleague Katie Mettler writes.\n\n\"I'm not about to be the male to tell a woman what to do with her body,\" said state Rep. John Rogers as he took to the House floor to express support for a woman's right to choose. \"She has a right to make that decision herself.\"\n\nHe then added: \"Some kids are unwanted, so you kill them now or kill them later,\" he said. \"You bring them into the world unwanted, unloved, then you send them to the electric chair. So you kill them now or you kill them later. But the bottom line is that I think we shouldn't be making this decision.\"\n\nAlabama Senate Majority Leader Greg Reed (R) called the remarks \"chilling.\" \"His comments should be condemned at the state and national level,\" Reed said.\n\nFrom March for Life:\n\nOUCH: A federal jury found five top executives of drug manufacturer Insys Therapeutics guilty of criminal racketeering following a 10-week trial and 15 days of deliberation.\n\nThe top executives, including company founder John Kapoor, were found guilty of charges involving bribing physicians to prescribe the company's potent fentanyl spray to patients who didn't need them. \"The trial brought out evidence that the company paid doctors sham speaking fees and that in one case, an exotic dancer-turned-company executive gave a doctor a lap dance to encourage him to prescribe the spray, Subsys, which is used for pain suffered by cancer patients,\" our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports.\n\nThe case against Insys executives is just one of a swath of cases across the country that aim to hold opioid manufacturers to account for their role in the nation's deadly opioid epidemic. Lenny writes that criminal charges against drug company management are rare.\n\n-- In a separate case, the state of West Virginia and drug distributor McKesson Corp. announced a $37 million settlement in a lawsuit over the company's role in the opioid crisis.\n\nMcKesson did not acknowledge wrongdoing, but agreed to pay $14.5 million this year and $4.5 each year for five years, with money going toward tackling the crisis, Lenny reports.\n\nThe settlement is a record agreement for the state and also marks the largest payment from any of the 13 drug wholesalers that West Virginia has been going after legally.\n\n\"McKesson distributed nearly 100 million doses of oxycodone and hydrocodone in West Virginia -- home to 1.8 million people -- between 2007 and 2012, the state charged,\" Lenny reports. \"That included, for example, 1.3 million doses in Boone County, where 24,629 people lived in 201o.\"\n\n-- Annual deductibles have skyrocketed for people with job-based health insurance, the most common form of coverage for working-age Americans, according to findings by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nOne in 6 Americans who get health coverage this way report having to make \"difficult sacrifices\" to be able to pay for health care, while 1 in 5 report that health-care costs have taken up all or most of their savings. More than 4 in 10 workers who are in high-deductible plans say they don't have enough savings to cover that deductible, the L.A. Times's Noam N. Levey reports on the findings in this first report in a series on high-deductible health plans.\n\nIn the past dozen years, those high-dollar deductibles in job-based health plans have reached an average of more than $1,300 annually.\n\nThe findings are based on a nationwide poll from the L.A. Times, which partnered with the Kaiser Family Foundation, with supplemental analysis from the Health Care Cost Institute and the Employee Benefit Research Institute. \"The explosion in cost-sharing is endangering patients' health as millions, including those with serious illnesses, skip care, independent research and the Times/KFF poll show,\" Noam writes. \"The shift in costs has also driven growing numbers of Americans with health coverage to charities and crowd-funding sites like GoFundMe in order to defray costs.\"\n\n-- Washington D.C. residents may soon be able to legally buy marijuana in the nation's capitol. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced a bill that would legalize recreational marijuana dispensaries in the city.\n\nCurrently, residents in the D.C. can legally grow and possess small amounts of marijuana under a voter-approved law from 2014. It is not legal, however, for residents to purchase pot. And the city can't tax sales of marijuana because of a federal budget provision blocking it from passing or enforcing marijuana legalization laws, as our Post colleague Fenit Nirappil writes.\n\nBowser's \"Safe Cannabis Sales Act\" would rename and task the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration with licensing and overseeing marijuana businesses. \"The minimum age to purchase marijuana would be 21. The bill would also crack down on attempts to avoid the existing restrictions on selling marijuana by offering it as a gift in exchange for purchasing clothing, artwork or other items,\" Fenit writes.\n\n-- As measles cases continue to surge across the country, the spread has put parents of babies too young to vaccinate in a bind.\n\nUsually infants don't get a first measles vaccination until after their first birthday, but as the New York Times's Julie Bosman reports, some parents have been given \"little choice but to chance exposing their yet-to-be-vaccinated babies any time they leave home.\" But it also means some parents are avoiding public areas, including public transportation, malls and playgrounds.\n\nJulie spoke, for example, with parents near Detroit, which has recently been a site of a major measles outbreak. A 29-year-old mother Lucretia Sims said there are \"just some places that we don't go.\" \"I think people have gotten a little selfish,\" she told Julie, talking about families who choose not to vaccinate. \"We depend on the community to take care of each other.

It's a call for real anti-racist policies.", "body": "For two U-Va. professors, Joe Biden's campaign launch raises serious questions.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden takes part in a forum on the opioid epidemic on April 11 at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. (Matt Rourke/AP) By Lisa Woolfork and Noelle Hurd May 3 at 6:00 AM\n\nLast week, much of Charlottesville was buzzing with the rumor that Joe Biden might announce his run for the Democratic presidential nomination here. A sizable contingent of community members, however, including anti-racist organizers, urgently hoped he would not. And indeed, two days before Biden's announcement, Charlottesville City Council member Wes Bellamy affirmed that Biden was not visiting the city.\n\nThursday morning, however, told a different story. Without Biden setting foot in Charlottesville, his presidential launch video managed to transform our hashtagged city from a potential campaign backdrop into a campaign prop. For Biden, #Charlottesville was the event that set in motion \"the battle for the soul of the nation.\"\n\nBiden's video suggests that he is running for president to answer an SOS call from the city. But using footage of the white supremacist attack on Charlottesville is not a sign that Biden wants to dismantle white supremacy. It is a sign of political shorthand and expediency, one that erases the reality of Charlottesville beyond the hashtag and obscures the deeply embedded structures of white supremacy in this city and in this nation.\n\nAs the number of contenders for the Democratic nomination grows by the day, some candidates are looking to draw sharp contrasts with President Trump. This is necessary but not sufficient for a would-be Democratic nominee. To be sure, Trump has aligned himself with white supremacist values in a multitude of ways, doubling down on his comments that play down neo-Nazi violence and commending Robert E. Lee just a few days ago.\n\nCalling out white supremacy and racism is therefore necessary, given the notable uptick in white supremacist violent extremism during the Trump era. But calling out racism and Trump's morally reprehensible speech and actions is not in itself a platform. Mentioning Charlottesville cannot substitute for advancing a genuine racial justice platform.\n\nSuch a platform requires a meaningful understanding of the ways in which white supremacist ideology has been the foundation on which our society was built.\n\nThe white supremacist ideologies that were generated to justify American slavery and maintain a racial hierarchy are hidden in plain sight, coded into our public discourse. Consider, for instance, the continued reverence of Thomas Jefferson, whose legacy infuses the city of Charlottesville. Jefferson is celebrated as the author of the Declaration of Independence but rarely acknowledged for his role in advancing the white supremacist ideology that is baked into every aspect of our democracy. And Jefferson's work as a progenitor of eugenics and an architect of white supremacist thought, though often overlooked, is key to understanding his political philosophy. In fact, it was this white supremacy that attracted the torch-lit mob to his University of Virginia statue, like a moth to a flame, that fateful night of Aug. 11, 2017.\n\nIt is the same white supremacy that drove fierce and violent efforts to oppress blacks in the years after Reconstruction, including President Andrew Johnson's decision to confiscate the land of freed blacks to facilitate the resettlement of Confederate soldiers, the creation of Black Codes and the convict leasing system that instituted slavery by another name, and the legal and extralegal efforts implemented by Southern legislators to prevent blacks from moving north to escape the repressive working conditions they faced during the Great Migration.\n\nIn addition to these efforts, which actively sought to re-create the economic and social conditions of slavery, new laws emerged even in places where plantation slavery had not existed to exploit, exclude and disenfranchise black Americans. These laws included restrictions on where blacks could live and attend school. For example, in the 1930s, the federal government, banks and the real estate industry worked together to prevent blacks from becoming homeowners and to create racially segregated neighborhoods. This process, known as redlining, served to concentrate whites in middle-class suburbs and blacks in impoverished urban centers. Given that public school funding relies largely on local taxes, housing segregation affects the quality of schools students attend.\n\nAll of this means that even after the removal of discriminatory housing policies and school segregation laws in the 1950s and 1960s, the consequences of this intentional segregation in housing persist in the form of highly segregated and unequal schools.\n\nAdd to this a prison industrial complex that literally profits from a racist criminal justice system and voter suppression laws that have been found to \"target African Americans with almost surgical precision,\" and the extent to which a white supremacist agenda permeates every aspect of our society is undeniable.\n\nThe problem with Biden's video is that it engages in a long-standing tradition of our country's leaders remaining unwilling to honestly confront this profoundly racist history. They refuse to ask white Americans to confront the ways in which their African American countrymen and women have remained subjugated long after slavery ended. In fact, within the first six seconds of Biden's campaign launch video, he invokes \"Charlottesville\" and \"Thomas Jefferson\" in warm, nostalgic tones: a quaint college town established by a revered Founding Father, invaded out of the blue by white supremacists.\n\nBut white supremacy is not new to Charlottesville; instead, it is a place that exemplifies how the active residue of white supremacy permeates most aspects of public life in many places around America. Charlottesville is a community with a black population of less than 20 percent, but black people were involved in more than 70 percent of traffic stops in 2017, and were 54 percent of those arrested in the past five years. Just over a month ago, our local schools were closed for two days after an anonymous violent threat against black and brown students as a part of an \"ethnic cleansing.\"\n\nJust a few days ago, a Charlottesville judge -- presiding over the case of city councilors being sued for voting to remove Jim Crow-era statues that once designated the parks as whites-only space -- determined that the Confederate statues were protected \"war memorials,\" discounting the fact that these monuments were erected in the early 1920s at the height of Jim Crow for the purpose of advancing a \"white supremacist future.\" Charlottesville has an untenable public housing crisis facilitated by gentrification but rooted in racist policies like the 1960s-era destruction of Vinegar Hill, a thriving black community in the city.\n\nIt has been 400 years since the first African arrived in Virginia. Since that time, the state's flourishing has unfurled alongside its subjugation of black people. Post reporter Michael E. Ruane describes Virginia as \"the nursery and battleground of slavery, a land of segregation, lynchings and white supremacy, and home to unbending racial oppression and the myth of the Confederate 'lost cause.'\"\n\nCharlottesville is fully implicated in Virginia's racist history. Thus, standing in solidarity with Charlottesville requires deep learning on the part of all Democratic presidential candidates to disrupt the white supremacist thought and deed so entrenched in this nation. Candidates should commit to understanding how our nation's classrooms continue to teach white supremacist pedagogy and tolerate racist imagery. Candidates should be racially literate, aware of white fragility and not easily derailed by discomfort of dealing with it. Candidates who want to engage in a true battle for the \"soul of our nation\" must first take full measure of the contours of its terrain.\n\nIf that candidate were to emerge from this rapidly growing field, it might ensure that our 46th president would be vastly better than the 45th while rejecting the same racist ideology propagated by the nation's third.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LaE2MinHaohhOLIXEU51RvVtX6w=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7GVYHBDH3QI6TJUYFKHYBDE47M.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 294575700}, {"uri": "1127146147", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-03", "time": "09:08:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-03T09:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/us/politics/klobuchar-addiction-plan.html", "title": "Amy Klobuchar Proposes $100 Billion for Addiction and Mental Health", "body": "Senator Amy Klobuchar on Friday released a $100 billion plan to combat drug and alcohol addiction and improve mental health care, focusing one of the first detailed proposals of her presidential campaign on an issue deeply personal to her.\n\nMs. Klobuchar -- who has spoken before about her father's alcoholism, including memorably at Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing -- said she had developed the plan and made it an early focus in part because of that personal experience and in part because of the number of addiction-related stories she had heard from voters.\n\nThe bulk of the plan is divided into three segments.\n\n* Prevention, including funding for mental health programs at schools, training for doctors to recognize early warning signs of addiction and other mental health problems, and a requirement that doctors use prescription drug monitoring programs intended to prevent \"doctor shopping,\" in which patients addicted to opioids receive new prescriptions from a number of doctors.\n\n* Treatment, including funding for addiction and mental health programs and stricter enforcement of the Affordable Care Act's requirement that insurers cover mental health care. The plan highlights in particular the need for more hospital beds and community clinics, especially in rural areas: Some of the counties hit hardest by the opioid crisis are rural, and many of them have no psychiatrists.\n\n* \"Ongoing recovery,\" including job training programs, transitional housing and other social services for recovering addicts. This segment of the plan also calls for treatment instead of incarceration for nonviolent drug offenders and crisis intervention training for police officers. There have been well-publicized instances of officers shooting unarmed people -- especially black men -- who were behaving erratically because of a mental illness.\n\nThe plan also includes funding for suicide prevention programs focused on veterans, farmers, Native Americans and L.G.B.T.Q. people, and for \"an aggressive national awareness campaign to combat stigma.\"\n\nA summary provided by Ms. Klobuchar's campaign said she would pay for the plan by charging opioid manufacturers and importers a two-cent fee per milligram, closing the carried-interest tax loophole, barring pharmaceutical companies from paying competitors to keep generic drugs off the market, and reaching a \"master settlement agreement\" with opioid companies.\n\n(As the opioid crisis has grown, so has the number of lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies and distributors. Ms. Klobuchar's plan essentially calls for one large settlement with the government, the proceeds of which would go to states to fund treatment programs and social services.)\n\nIn a statement, Ms. Klobuchar said that after three citations for driving under the influence, her father \"finally got real treatment and was, in his own words, 'pursued by grace.'\"\n\n\"The one thing I hear over and over again across the country is people's stories of battling with mental health and addiction,\" she said. \"People need help, but they just can't get it.

The money will go toward state efforts to address the opioid crisis, including rehabilitation, job training and mental health programs, the company said in a statement.\n\nThe payment is the largest from any of 13 pharmaceutical wholesalers the state has been pursuing legally for years. It pushes the total recouped to $84 million, which includes previous settlments with Cardinal Health ($20 million) and AmerisourceBergen ($16 million), according to Gov. Jim Justice (R).\n\nThose companies and McKesson control nearly 90 percent of the distribution of legal painkillers in the United States.\n\nIn 2017, McKesson agreed to pay $150 million in a record-setting settlement of charges brought by federal authorities. Last year the company pledged $100 million toward fighting the opioid crisis.\n\nIn a separate criminal case Thursday, a federal jury in Boston convicted five executives of Insys Therapeutics, including company founder John Kapoor, of racketeering charges for bribing doctors to unnecessarily prescribe the company's powerful fentanyl spray.\n\nThe trial brought out evidence that the company paid doctors sham speaking fees and that in one case an exotic dancer-turned-company executive gave a doctor a lap dance to encourage him to prescribe the spray, Subsys, which is used for pain suffered by cancer patients. The woman, Sunrise Lee, was among the people convicted Thursday.\n\nCriminal charges against drug company management are rare. But last month, federal prosecutors in New York accused two executives of the nation's sixth-largest drug distributor, Rochester Drug Cooperative, of charges that include conspiring to distribute narcotics for non-medical reasons. The men, one of whom has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with authorities, face 10 years to life in prison.\n\nHundreds of states, counties, cities and Native American tribes have filed civil suits against drug distributors, manufacturers and pharmacy chains, hoping to win compensation for the costs of grappling with the two-decade-old drug crisis.\n\nIn a closely watched state case, Oklahoma settled in March with Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, for $270 million and is scheduled to go to trial against Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceuticals May 28.\n\nFederal law makes distributors -- which ship drugs from manufacturers to drug stores, hospitals, nursing homes and elsewhere -- responsible for spotting unusual amounts, patterns or frequency of narcotic sales, which can indicate that drugs are being diverted to the black market.\n\nInstead, McKesson distributed nearly 100 million doses of oxycodone and hydrocodone in the state -- home to 1.8 million people -- between 2007 and 2012, the state charged. That included, for example, 1.3 million doses in Boone County, where 24,629 people lived in 201o.\n\nIn 2017, West Virginia led the nation with 57.8 drug overdose deaths per 100,000 residents, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The giant distributor funneled enough hydrocodone and oxycodone to supply every legitimate patient with nearly 3,000 doses, state officials said.\n\nTiny Boone County, with a population of fewer than 25,000, received 1.2 million doses of hydrocodone and oxycodone between 2007 and 2012, the lawsuit claimed.\n\nMcKesson vigorously denied the allegations on Wednesday. April Marks, a spokeswoman for the company, said in a prepared statement that the company \"is committed to working with others to end this national crisis, however, and is pleased that the settlement provides funding toward initiatives intended to address the opioid epidemic.\"\n\nUnder the settlement, McKesson will pay $37 million to West Virginia. Nearly half of the amount is to be paid out within three business days of the case's dismissal, with the remainder paid in annual installments over five years.\n\nSen.

With the drug's sales soaring, Insys became a darling of Wall Street, generating annual sales at one point of more than $300 million.\n\nThe arguments presented at the trial have echoes in cases across the country, where prosecutors and state attorneys general are trying to hold major drug makers, like Purdue Pharma and Johnson & Johnson, accountable for the opioid epidemic that has killed tens of thousands of people in recent years.\n\nBut unlike the amalgam of recent civil lawsuits pending against opioid manufacturers and major distributors around the country, Mr. Kapoor and several former Insys executives were tried on criminal charges. They were accused of racketeering conspiracy, which can carry lengthy prison sentences. In addition to Mr. Kapoor, the other executives found guilty in the case were Richard M. Simon, the former national director of sales; Sunrise Lee and Joseph A. Rowan, both former regional sales directors; and Michael J. Gurry, former vice president of managed markets.\n\nThe former chief executive, Michael L. Babich, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and mail fraud charges.\n\nCriminal charges against drug company executives are uncommon. One of the rare exceptions involved another opioid manufacturer, Purdue Pharma, whose executives pleaded guilty in 2007 to criminal charges that they misled regulators, doctors and patients about the addiction potential of the painkiller OxyContin.\n\nAt the Insys trial, the government suggested executives at the Arizona-based company often operated like drug dealers and that Mr. Kapoor was the ringleader.\n\n\"The decisions, the money, the strategy came from the top,\" K. Nathaniel Yeager, a federal prosecutor, said during closing arguments.\n\nDetails of Insys's strategy from 2012 to 2015 to target doctors and allegedly bribe them have been revealed in lawsuits and news reports for about five years. The trial of Mr. Kapoor and his four co-defendants has brought to light the extent to which the schemes permeated the entire company and its national sales team.\n\nFormer Insys sales representatives, testifying for the prosecution, said their bonuses were tied to the dosages of Subsys prescribed by the doctors they recruited. The higher the dose, the higher the bonus. Evidence presented in court showed that sales representatives had to justify low doses to their boss within 24 hours.\n\nNot only did Subsys cost more at higher doses, but patients were also more likely to become dependent on the highly addictive medication. Subsys is up to 100 times more potent than morphine.\n\nAlec Burlakoff, the former vice president of sales at Insys, has pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy. He wrote in an email read at trial that patients on high doses would be desirable because they \"will continuously refill their monthly prescriptions indefinitely.\" Court filings in a separate case suggest Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, pursued a similar strategy.\n\nTwo Insys sales representatives made a rap video in 2015 about titration, the technique used to increase a patient's dose. The main lyric: \"I love titrations, and it's not a problem. I got new patients, and I got a lot of them.\" The video, in which the salesmen dance alongside a person in a Subsys dispenser costume, was shown at a national Insys sales staff meeting where Mr. Kapoor was present.\n\nTestimony from government witnesses suggested there were few limits to what the Insys sales team was willing to do. Mr. Burlakoff, who testified for the prosecution as part of a plea deal, said the company purposefully targeted doctors with a history of liberally prescribing opioids. \"Pill mills, for us, meant dollar signs,\" he told the jury. \"It was not run the other way. It was run to the pill mills.\"\n\nHolly Brown, a former Insys sales representative in the Chicago area, testified that she saw her boss, Ms. Lee, a former exotic dancer, give a doctor a lap dance hoping it would encourage him to prescribe Subsys.\n\nAfter doctors prescribed Subsys, the company focused on persuading insurance companies to cover the drug, which can cost thousands of dollars a month. Jurors heard recorded calls from the Insys Reimbursement Center in which employees posed as doctor's assistants and invented diagnoses that would smooth the approval process.\n\n\"Insurers were told about medical things that never happened,\" Mr. Yeager told the jury. \"They told deception after deception after deception on recorded lines.\"\n\nBrad Bailey, a former federal prosecutor of drug cases in Massachusetts, said the case highlighted the federal government's efforts to broaden its strategies for curbing the epidemic.\n\nThe government is saying, \"We have got to do something about the flow of opioids in this country -- not from across the borders, not from people's kitchens where they're made and converted -- but from the pharmaceutical companies that are making billions,\" Mr. Bailey said.\n\nIn a similar effort to hold individuals accountable, the attorneys general in New York and Massachusetts have recently turned their attention to the Sacklers, the family that controls Purdue, filing lawsuits that allege members of the family pushed their company to aggressively sell opioids like OxyContin, despite the high risk for addiction.\n\nWhile the legal strategy may be noteworthy, evidence has emerged that aggressive marketing of opioids is far from unique to Insys.\n\n\"The Insys story is symbolic, representative of the kind of conduct, the kinds of things that have been going on behind the scenes to fuel this opioid crisis,\" said Gregory Curfman, deputy editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nGovernment lawyers called witnesses and presented their arguments over the course of two months. Defense lawyers rested their case in less than three days.\n\nBeth Wilkinson, the lawyer for Mr. Kapoor, sought to persuade the jury that many of Insys's marketing strategies were commonplace. Pharmaceutical companies often hire physicians to help promote their medications.\n\n\"In this country, that's not illegal. In fact, it's not even unusual,\" Ms. Wilkinson told the jury during opening statements. Plus, she explained that \"all the information is public\" on the government's Open Payments Data website.\n\n\"Things did go wrong,\" Ms. Wilkinson conceded in closing arguments, but she laid the blame entirely on Mr. Kapoor's colleagues. She singled out Mr. Burlakoff, the ex-vice president of sales who became a star prosecution witness, saying he \"was at the center of it all.\"\n\nLawyers on both sides acknowledged Mr. Burlakoff had a track record of lying and, at the end of one day of testimony, Judge Allison Burroughs called him \"evasive.\"\n\nJudge Burroughs repeatedly questioned whether the government had enough evidence to prove the racketeering charge. Toward the end of the trial, the defense motioned for acquittal, arguing that the government had not proven that there was any agreement between Insys and physicians to write medically unwarranted prescriptions. Judge Burroughs said that while she would defer to the jury, she found this element of the prosecution's case \"pretty darn thin.\"\n\nInsys has struggled to move past its legal troubles. The company's stock currently trades at around $4 per share, down from a high in 2015 of nearly $45, and it has disclosed to investors that it is at risk of going out of business.

Already during my time in office, we have reduced the total amount of opioid prescribed by 34 percent. That's a pretty amazing number.\"\n\n-- President Trump, speaking at a drug summit in Atlanta, April 24, 2019\n\nDuring a recent speech on the administration's efforts to ease the opioid crisis, President Trump asserted that his administration had already achieved its goal of cutting nationwide opioid prescriptions by one-third.\n\nTrump's original goal, made on March 19, 2018, was to reach this target within three years. So obviously we were curious about whether the claim about already reaching the milestone within a year was valid.\n\nHere's what we found out. It's an interesting tale of how data generated in the administration loses its nuance the closer it gets to the president's lips.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe president, after noting the goal to cut prescriptions by one-third, framed this achievement in personal terms: \"Already during my time in office, we have reduced the total amount of opioid prescribed by 34 percent.\"\n\nBut a White House fact sheet, issued the same day, pitched this less as an administration achievement and mentioned no goal, though it kept the time period: \"In the first two years of the Administration, we saw a 34 percent decrease in the total amount of opioids prescribed.\"\n\nFinally, the agency that generated the statistic, the Department of Health and Human Services, was even more careful in its own fact sheet. It cast the percentage decline as tentative and requiring additional research: \"From the President's inauguration in January 2017 through February 2019, initial market data suggests that the total amount of opioids being prescribed monthly has dropped by 34 percent. While we need more data to confirm this snapshot, it shows we may have succeeded in meeting this [three-year] goal already.\"\n\nAs you can see, it is a bit like a game of telephone, with the accuracy of the statement getting diminished with each retelling. Our eyebrows went up when we saw that the statistic apparently was based on monthly data points.\n\nAn HHS spokesman provided the numbers. The data reflected the nationwide prescribing of opioids measured in MMEs (morphine milligram equivalents -- a measure of opioid amount/intensity), drawn from the IQVIA National Prescription Audit, a database for retail pharmacy and mail pharmacy channels only.\n\nJanuary 2017: 13,627,002,271\n\nFebruary 2019: 8,967,556,436\n\n(Technical note: These numbers are not comparable to prescription data on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website because it does not include controlled long-term care environments -- nursing homes and skilled-nursing facilities -- or prescriptions for buprenorphine, which is primarily used for patients in treatment.)\n\nThat's certainly a decline of 34 percent. Experts said that using an MME measure is probably the most useful (though a prescribing rate rather than raw numbers might be more informative).\n\nBut there are several problems.\n\nFirst, two monthly data points are not especially useful to measure long-term progress. We were able to review all of the monthly data, though not publish it. February in recent years for some reason appears to experience big drops, and that happens to be the end point. A three-month rolling average shows a decline, though not as stark as 34 percent.\n\n\"Measuring the decrease using monthly prescriptions is absolutely legitimate,\" said an HHS spokesman. \"We focus on leading indicators to help us better and more quickly respond to this crisis, rather than waiting a year to evaluate what we are doing.\"\n\nBut, more important, time did not start with the Trump administration. Opioid prescriptions have been declining for years, having reached a peak in 2010 or 2012, depending on what data set you use. The declines especially began to accelerate after the CDC in March 2016 issued new guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain -- 10 months before Trump took the oath of office.\n\nHHS has published quarterly fiscal-year data for MMEs dispensed since the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. It shows that decline really sped up in early 2016, about the time the CDC guidelines were issued. The number of MMEs dispensed has fallen about 30 percent from the second quarter of the 2016 fiscal year (January-March) to the end of 2018.\n\nJust looking at second quarter of fiscal year 2017 through the end of fiscal year 2018 -- essentially Trump's first two years -- the decline amounts to 22 percent, from 41 billion MMEs a quarter to 32 billion MMEs.\n\nFinally, we would argue that the president's pledge was to reduce opioids by one-third in three years dating from his speech in March 2018, because he said: \"We're going to cut nationwide opioid prescriptions by one-third over the next three years.\" We reviewed administration briefings after the speech and news coverage and can find no indication it was anything other than a three-year goal starting in 2018. Reporters identified 2021 as the end date.\n\nThat would mean at least a reduction of 12 billion MMEs -- from 35 billion MMEs a quarter at the time of the speech to 23 billion. Backdating to the start of Trump's presidency seems to be moving the goal posts, as the decline in MMEs since Trump's speech is about 20 percent, not 34 percent.\n\nAsked whether progress should be measured from March 2018, the HHS spokesman replied: \"While the March 2018 date marks the release of 'President Donald J. Trump's Initiative to Stop Opioid Abuse and Reduce Drug Supply and Demand,' efforts to combat the opioid crisis were already well underway. The opioid epidemic has been a top priority for the Trump Administration since taking office in January 2017.\"\n\nExperts in the field said the decline in prescriptions is less impressive than it sounds because the trend significantly predates the Trump administration -- and because the more important metric is reducing overdoses.\n\n\"By itself, the number of prescriptions is not a public-health outcome,\" said Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. \"You can't say mission accomplished because the number of prescriptions has gone down.\"\n\nSharfstein noted that even as prescriptions have begun to shrink in recent years, overdoses have soared. (Recent 12-month rolling provisional CDC data touted by the administration indicates the overdose increase may have plateaued and even begun to decline.) The reasons for this disconnect are the subject of dispute among medical professionals, with some arguing that cutting back on opioid prescriptions may have led some people to switch to heroin or synthetic opioids. Other experts say the data does not support that analysis.\n\nIn any case, they said, Trump is wrong to suggest this is an administration success story, even if it has taken steps such as pushing for a reduction in opioid manufacturing.\n\n\"I don't think the Trump administration deserves credit for the more cautious prescribing of opioids,\" said Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University. \"The reduction in prescriptions began in 2012 and improved a bit in 2016. Everything we are seeing is trending in the right direction, but no other country prescribes as much as we do.\"\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nThere are several problems with the way the president framed this statistic. He should have indicated the data was tentative, as HHS responsibly did, but instead he suggests a goal has already been achieved. (As we noted, the goal posts also appear to have been moved.) Moreover, he once again takes credit for a trend that started in the Obama administration, in part because of actions taken under that administration.\n\nThe president earns Three Pinocchios.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7Y2H66tijb8MnNyw4HsuUVIZHsQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q75ERHTG2YI6TJUYFKHYBDE47M.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 294477480}, {"uri": "1125593593", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-01", "time": "11:52:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-01T11:52:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8156862854957581, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2019/05/01/the-health-202-new-cbo-analysis-could-torpedo-medicare-for-all-proposals/5cc85cc11ad2e52459e2470f/", "title": "Analysis | The Health 202: New CBO analysis could torpedo Medicare-for-all proposals", "body": "Democrats eyeing Medicare-for-all are trying to avoid the same trap Republicans fell into back in 2017 when they were trying to replace Obamacare.\n\nThe trap is this: a damaging analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, Congress's official scorekeeper.\n\nThis afternoon, the CBO is expected to release a highly anticipated report on the potential structure and costs of transitioning the United States into a single-payer system. The report, requested by Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), will analyze a number of questions raised by Medicare-for-all proposals, including what services would be covered, what costs consumers would share, how much doctors and hospitals would be paid and how the whole thing might be paid for.\n\nBut Yarmuth notably didn't ask the CBO for a specific cost-estimate of the Medicare-for-all bill proposed by Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), which the House Rules Committee examined yesterday and which more than 100 members of Congress have embraced.\n\nThat score could be sizable -- and probably would fuel charges from Republicans and the health-care industry that Medicare-for-all is an impossible and rash scheme that would jeopardize health care for millions of Americans. The Jayapal measure, which would grant every American a comprehensive health plan with very little cost-sharing, probably would cost more than $30 trillion or even $40 trillion over the next decade, many times the cost of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"There is no avoiding the reality that the Medicare-for-all price tag would not only destroy our current health care system, it would blow up our budget and devastate our economy,\" the Budget Committee's top Republican, Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.), said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats know well how CBO scores can be used as political ammunition. It was only two years ago that they glommed onto the agency's estimates that GOP health-care bills would result in 22 million fewer people having health coverage. Over and over, they whacked Republicans with that figure until the whole repeal-and-replace effort crumbled.\n\nThe CBO report will keep Medicare-for-all on center stage this week, coming on the heels of yesterday's five-hour Rules Committee hearing on Jayapal's bill.\n\nTweets from Jayapal, who attended the hearing:\n\nThat hearing could easily have devolved into little more than a fight over government involvement in health care. But the panel's nine Democrats mostly used it to raise detailed questions about the logistics of transitioning the country's patchworked health insurance system into a single program run by the government.\n\nRep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) quizzed the witnesses on whether Medicare-for-all would result in doctor shortages because physicians would presumably be paid less.\n\nVox's Dylan Scott:\n\nRep. Joe Morelle (D-N.Y.) raised difficulties with paying for a single-payer system by hiking payroll taxes. \"If we didn't go into this with a clearheaded view of what this would mean, I think we're doing a disservice,\" Morelle said.\n\nRules Chair Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) wrapped up the hearing by saying that \"some in the press and watching online have been surprised this was such a civilized and in-depth hearing.\"\n\nEven the committee's four Republicans, who made clear they're not on board with Medicare-for-all, praised the Democrats at times.\n\n\"You kept this focused and very civil,\" ranking Republican Tom Cole (Okla.) told McGovern.\n\n\"I cannot support her legislation, but I support her,\" Rep. Rob Woodall (R-Ga.) said at another point, referring to Jayapal, who was present for the hearing.\n\nThe hearing's seven witnesses mostly maintained measured tones. Two doctors, emergency room physician Farzon Nahvi and retired colonel Doris Browne, told lawmakers the country is already paying for care for the uninsured who visit emergency rooms -- and it's less efficient and more costly because they're not able to visit primary care physicians.\n\nGeorge Mason University economist Charles Blahous said he has estimated Medicare-for-all would add $32 trillion to $39 trillion to federal health-care spending -- but he agreed with Democrats that most of that would be offset by eliminating private health plans.\n\nThe most urgent Medicare-for-all advocate was Ady Barkan, a 35-year-old activist dying of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, who delivered his testimony through a computer because he's no longer able to speak.\n\n\"The ugly truth is this: Health care is not treated as a human right in the United States of America,\" said Barkan. \"On the day we are born and on the day we die, and on so many days in between, all of us need medical care. And yet in this country, the wealthiest in the history of human civilization, we do not have an effective or fair or rational system for delivering that care.\"\n\nVia Vox's Dylan Scott:\n\nYet the lawmakers didn't brush over their differences. Cole called Jayapal's Medicare-for-all measure \"a radical bill,\" saying Democrats have \"not told us how much this massive new program would cost, who would pay for it and how much taxes would have to go up.\" Meanwhile, McGovern stressed that \"health care is a right for all, not a privilege for the lucky few.\"\n\n\"That dispute was part of the subtext that played out in a small House hearing room as congressional proponents of Medicare-for-all put forth their moral, political and economic case,\" my colleague Amy Goldstein writes. \"The hearing offered single-payer proponents their moments in the sun without necessarily moving legislation closer to becoming law.\"\n\nMcGovern:\n\nStay tuned for more Medicare-for-all discussions on Capitol Hill. Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.), who presides over one of the two key House committees with health-care jurisdiction, said he will also hold a hearing.\n\nInside Health Policy reporter Ariel Cohen:\n\nAHH: The Food and Drug Administration has cleared Philip Morris to sell a heat-not-burn tobacco device known as IQOS in the United States.\n\nThe device, meant to be an alternative to conventional cigarettes, includes a tube that heats up tobacco sticks instead of burning them, which makes the tobacco being inhaled less harmful, our Post colleagues Laurie McGinley and William Wan report.\n\nAs experts in the United States debate how IQOS would impact public health, the FDA said the device would be \"appropriate\" for public health because \"the products produce fewer or lower levels of some toxins than combustible cigarettes,\" the agency said in its announcement.\n\nThe FDA also noted that the product, while greenlighted for sale, has not been \"approved\" yet by the agency. \"That's because all tobacco products are potentially harmful and addictive, and people who do not use tobacco products should continue not to, the agency said,\" Laurie and William write.\n\nThere are concerns that the device could attract minors or nonsmokers, or that people who currently smoke would use the device in addition to their regular smoking habits.\n\nOOF: Three major health insurers received a combined $11.5 billion in drug rebates last year just through their Medicare businesses, according to an analysis from Axios.\n\nThe findings signal how the companies, CVS Health, Humana and UnitedHealth Group, which control a majority of Medicare's prescription drug coverage, are \"most at risk from the Trump administration's plan to eliminate rebates within Medicare,\" Axios's Bob Herman reports.\n\n\"These companies rely heavily on rebates to offset the costs of covering seniors' prescriptions. Losing those rebates would shift billions of dollars away from them, and they could lose customers if they raise premiums to make up the difference,\" he writes, adding the plans pass Medicare rebates back to the federal government, though they do keep a small percentage of rebates from commercial plans.\n\nAccording to filings with state insurance commissioners, UnitedHealthcare paid $7.3 billion in prescription drug claims and received $4.1 billion in rebates, Humana paid $7.1 billion in prescription claims and received $3.9 billion in rebates, and CVS paid $6.3 billion in prescription claims and received $3.5 billion in rebates.\n\nIf rebates are eliminated, companies like these may raise monthly drug plan premiums to avoid losses, which could dissuade seniors from keeping their plans.\n\nOUCH: A working paper recently circulated by the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests raising the minimum wage and the earned-income tax credit could help reduce the growing suicide rate.\n\nThe suicide rate nationwide has increased 35 percent since 2000, our Post colleague Andrew Van Dam reports. But raising the minimum wage and the EITC by 10 percent each could prevent about 1,230 suicides each year, the report found.\n\n\"There are hints that these deaths are the result of worsening prospects among less-educated people but few immediate answers. But maybe the solution is simple: pursue policies that improve the prospects of working-class Americans,\" Andrew writes.\n\nThe report included analysis of 1999-2015 death data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, examining states that raised their minimum wage or EITC in those years, measuring the change in suicide rates before and after the policies took effect. \"[T]he number of suicides that weren't related to drugs dropped noticeably,\" he reports. \"Among adults without a college education, increasing the EITC by 10 percent appears to have decreased non-drug suicides by about 5.5 percent. Raising the minimum wage by 10 percent reduced suicides by 3.6 percent.\"\n\n-- More young people are attempting suicide using poison, according to new data published in the Journal of Pediatrics.\n\nIn the last decade in the United States, the rate of suicide attempts by poison has more than doubled for people under age 19 and more than tripled for girls and young women ages 10 to 24, our colleague William reports.\n\nThe study also found attempted suicides by poison for people ages 10 to 15 began to skyrocket from 2011 to 2018 after being relatively flat until 2010. During that time, the numbers increased by 141 percent overall, and 338 percent for girls ages 10 to 12.\n\n\"There's something very alarming happening here,\" said study co-author Henry Spiller, director of the Central Ohio Poison Center. \"Even if we don't know why it's happening, it's a major signal that there are big problems in children's lives right now and we as a society need to address them.\"\n\nSpiller and co-author John Ackerman said while they can't answer the \"why\" behind the new numbers, they \"suspect the sudden increase in recent years has to do with the advent of smartphones and how they have made social media much more pervasive in young people's lives,\" William writes.\n\n-- Three hospitals in the District of Columbia have launched programs to provide medication-assisted addiction treatment to overdose victims who come to their emergency rooms, our Post colleague Peter Jamison reports, the city's latest effort to cut its overdose deaths in half by the end of next year.\n\nThe new programs at Howard University Hospital, MedStar Washington Hospital Center and United Medical Center will allow overdose victims to take buprenorphine while they are in the emergency room. The treatment is meant to reduce cravings for opioids, including heroin.\n\nThese programs are part of a series of moves the district has made following a report by Peter in December that highlighted the city's failed response to a growing opioid epidemic. \"Since then, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) has announced a dramatic expansion in the distribution of naloxone, a lifesaving overdose antidote. Federal officials also launched an audit, still ongoing, of D.C. officials' use of $4 million in grant money to treat opioid addiction,\" Peter writes.\n\nThe treatment program using buprenorphine was supposed to launch at United Medical Center, a public hospital in Washington, almost two years ago, but officials had not followed through on the plan, as Peter reported.\n\n-- There are serious discrepancies in the price of identical services common in health care, according to new data from the Health Care Cost Institute that looked at health insurance claims for 34 million Americans. For example, as the New York Times's Margot Sanger-Katz reports, a metabolic blood panel test was found to cost $11 and $952 based on two negotiated prices paid by insurance companies in two U.S. cities.\n\nMargot shares a graphic detailing how the cost of a basic blood test varies in different cities:\n\n\"Although hospitals are now required to publish a list of the prices they would like patients to pay for their services, the amounts that medical providers actually agree to accept from insurance companies tend to remain closely held secrets,\" she writes.\n\nThe Trump administration, which has called for public comments on a proposal to mandate that doctors and hospitals publish negotiated prices, could put an end to the opacity in these prices.\n\n-- New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) announced a ban on alcohol advertisements on city property, including at bus shelters and newsstands, citing concerns public health risks related to excessive drinking.\n\nThe ban takes effect immediately, but spaces that are currently allowed to sell alcohol are exempt, such as restaurants, concert venues and stadiums. Advertisements currently up will be allowed to finish out their contract term.\n\n\"This order banning alcohol ads from City property reaffirms our commitment to health equity and our stand to protect the well-being of all New Yorkers,\" de Blasio said in a statement.\n\n\"In New York City, we see far too many deaths related to alcohol,\" city Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot said in a statement. \"We know exposure to alcohol advertising can lead to drinking more alcohol, more often -- behavior that can be harmful and even fatal. Today's ban of alcohol ads on city property will help protect communities from the burden of harmful alcohol advertising.\"\n\nThe evolution of Joe Biden's comments on Anita Hill:", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/c96039fb7fb955fd3dd99efd094bed67-4200-2799-70-8-SROMKVDLOEI6TJTNVAWT6PMW2U.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4759706", "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 294407520}, {"uri": "1125374280", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-01", "time": "05:09:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-01T05:09:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.47843137383461, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/suicide-attempts-using-poison-have-surged-among-young-people/2019/04/30/a980c98c-6b8d-11e9-a66d-a82d3f3d96d5_story.html", "title": "Suicide attempts using poison have surged among young people, particularly girls", "body": "By William Wan William Wan National correspondent covering health, science and news May 1 at 12:01 AM\n\nMore young people than ever are trying to kill themselves using poison. The rate of attempted suicide by poison has more than doubled among people under 19 in the past decade in the United States and more than tripled for girls and young women 10 to 24.\n\nThe new numbers, published Wednesday in the Journal of Pediatrics, come amid an overall rise in suicides nationwide across age groups and gender. But the sudden and sharp rise in poison-related suicide attempts by children and teens has left researchers and health advocates searching for answers.\n\n\"There's something very alarming happening here,\" said Henry Spiller, director of the Central Ohio Poison Center and co-author of the study. \"Even if we don't know why it's happening, it's a major signal that there are big problems in children's lives right now and we as a society need to address them.\"\n\nSuicide is the 10th-most-common cause of death in the United States and the second- most-common among teenagers and young adults.\n\nDrawing on 19 years of data from 55 poison centers across the country, researchers found that among people 10 to 15, attempted suicides by poison were relatively flat until 2010.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2018, however, the numbers began to skyrocket, increasing by 141 percent overall. The occurrence among girls was particular pronounced. Among girls 10 to 12, for example, the poison-suicide attempts increased by 338 percent.\n\nOf the 1.6 million suicide attempts by youths examined in the study, more than 1.1 million, or 71 percent, were by girls.\n\nPart of that can be attributed to differences in the methods people use to kill themselves that hold true from adolescents to adults.\n\nBoys and men are more likely to employ violent means such as guns and suffocation. Girls and women are more likely than males to ingest pills or other forms of poison.\n\nThe data shows that the rate at which poison-related suicide attempts have resulted in serious injuries or deaths has also increased among young people.\n\n\"The numbers are troubling, and it confirms a lot of current concerns about suicide drifting into younger ages,\" said Christine Moutier, who is chief medical officer for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and was not involved in the study.\n\nSpiller said he is working on a follow-up study that focuses on what poisonous substances are being used most by young people. So far, he said, \"it looks like a wide variety, basically what's in the home: Tylenol, antihistamines, their parents' pills, medication for ADHD, anti-depressants.\"\n\nSpiller said he and others have overlaid their findings with other data to try to identify why the rates have spiked so sharply since 2011. They studied data from the rise of opioid addiction and deaths in recent years, thinking that the sharp increase could be due to increased access to drugs or fallout from parents' deaths or addictions. But the timing did not fit precisely -- the beginnings of the opioid epidemic traces back years before the 2011 spike.\n\nThey also compared it against economic data, but much of the country's downturn occurred in 2008 or 2009.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we can't definitely answer the why. That's not how the data works,\" said John Ackerman, a co-author and clinical psychologist at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nAckerman and Spiller, however, suspect the sudden increase in recent years has to do with the advent of smartphones and how they have made social media much more pervasive in young people's lives.\n\nThe iPhone 3 came out in 2008, Spiller notes, and the Android phones had come into widespread use by 2011. Adults adopted such devices first, but within a year or two, such smartphones became more common among adolescents.\n\nFor years now, across all demographic groups, the death rate from suicide has been rising broadly. Experts cannot easily explain it. There is no single factor driving the phenomenon.\n\nStudies have shown suicidal thoughts among teenagers ages 18 or 19 have increased 46 percent from 2008 to 2017, and suicide attempts among people 22 to 23 have doubled.\n\n\"It's not going to be any one thing that explains these troubling trends,\" Moutier said. \"And the impact of social media on youth mental health is complex, but the research we've seen so far suggests heavy screen time does have an impact on mood, sleep and suicide risk.\"\n\nAckerman at Nationwide Children's Hospital has been working with 125 middle and high schools in Ohio to help them develop stronger suicide prevention programs.\n\n\"There are things we know work, but we haven't even scratched the surface on implementing them,\" he said. For example, he said, universal screening for suicide -- simply asking all students a handful of questions, including whether they have had suicidal thoughts -- has shown to be effective at identifying those most at risk.\n\nBut few schools have such screening programs in place, child advocates say, and there is a shortage of funding, resources and training for suicide prevention in most school systems.\n\nAnother obstacle Ackerman said he often sees among parents and school officials in tackling the rising problem of youth suicides is embarrassment, shame or simply fear they won't know what to say or do.\n\n\"There's this myth that if you talk about suicide you will put it in their minds,\" he said. \"But that doesn't solve the problem. You actually reduce the risk when you have a plan for helping kids through these difficult feelings.\"\n\nRead more\n\nTeenage depression and suicide are way up -- and so is smartphone use\n\nMapping out the causes of suicide in teenagers and children\n\nRegular screening can find teen depression, but getting treatment isn't easy", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WRBuEQxx9y2WWzx-7eqoZzRBozo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PW4WRZDARII6TH7SVPEYJXE65Q.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4757987", "sentiment": -0.4823529411764705, "wgt": 294383340}, {"uri": "1125133228", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-30", "time": "20:06:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-30T20:06:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/opioid-treatment-with-buprenorphine-launches-at-three-dc-emergency-rooms/2019/04/30/b73e0f2a-6b61-11e9-be3a-33217240a539_story.html", "title": "Opioid treatment with buprenorphine launches at three D.C. emergency rooms", "body": "By Peter Jamison Peter Jamison Reporter covering D.C. politics and government April 30 at 3:37 PM\n\nThree D.C. hospitals have launched programs providing medication-assisted addiction treatment to recent overdose victims in emergency rooms, a key component in the District's plan to reduce overdose deaths by half by the end of next year.\n\nHoward University Hospital, MedStar Washington Hospital Center and United Medical Center all have their treatment programs up and running, the D.C. Hospital Association announced Tuesday -- meeting the April 30 deadline established by the D.C. government.\n\nThe programs involve outreach to opioid overdose victims, who will be able to begin taking buprenorphine -- a medicine that diminishes cravings for heroin and other opioids -- while still in the emergency room.\n\nSimilar initiatives have been set up at hospital emergency departments across the country, based on a 2015 study at Yale-New Haven Hospital that showed users who start buprenorphine during emergency-room visits often have more success in recovery.\n\nJacqueline D. Bowens, the hospital association's president and chief executive, said in a statement that the association and hospitals \"have worked with a great sense of care and urgency to launch this most important program as a critical step in battling this terrible opioid epidemic.\"\n\nThe District saw one of the most severe increases in opioid overdose deaths over the last several years, mostly caused by heroin laced with the lethal synthetic opioid fentanyl.\n\nThe city recorded 279 opioid overdose deaths in 2017, more than three times the 2014 number. Deaths dropped to 213 in 2018, according to city officials, a figure that still surpassed the city's homicide total.\n\nWhile America's opioid epidemic is often seen as primarily afflicting rural and suburban whites, most overdose victims in the District are black -- many of them older men who used heroin with relative safety for decades before the arrival of fentanyl.\n\nIn December, The Washington Post reported on the city's faltering response to rising opioid deaths. Since then, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) has announced a dramatic expansion in the distribution of naloxone, a life-saving overdose antidote. Federal officials also launched an audit, still ongoing, of D.C. officials' use of $4 million in grant money.\n\nBuprenorphine treatment of the kind now established in three of the city's emergency rooms was supposed to have begun at United Medical Center -- the District's public hospital, and home to the city's busiest emergency room for overdose victims -- almost two years ago, The Post reported. But D.C. officials never followed through on that earlier version of the plan.\n\nThe Bowser administration released a blueprint in December for cutting overdose deaths in half. After District lawmakers complained that it was not detailed enough, the mayor last month released a revised plan with more specific goals and timelines.\n\nThe hospital association is coordinating the efforts with the Mosaic Group, a consulting firm, and the McClendon Center, a nonprofit provider of mental-health services.\n\nDozens criticize D.C. opioid response at Council hearing\n\nMonths after mayor's plan released, key opioid initiatives still in planning stage\n\nFalling out: A generation of African American heroin users is quietly dying\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/i_0YohSu3ka4wNe5CIU4bqeUMqI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OJQ6E5CQAMI6TCFB5U2G6DWJJ4.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 294350760}, {"uri": "1124907435", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-30", "time": "14:34:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-30T14:34:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8745098114013672, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/04/30/researchers-say-theres-simple-way-reduce-suicides-increase-minimum-wage/", "title": "Researchers say there's a simple way to reduce suicides: Increase the minimum wage", "body": "Brian Benson of the Kern County coroner's office unloads the body of a 44-year-old white woman in Bakersfield, Calif., in 2016.

(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) By Andrew Van Dam Andrew Van Dam Reporter focusing on economic data April 30 at 10:22 AM\n\nSince 2000, the suicide rate in the United States has risen 35 percent, primarily because of the significant increase in such deaths among the white population.\n\nThere are hints that these deaths are the result of worsening prospects among less-educated people but few immediate answers. But maybe the solution is simple: pursue policies that improve the prospects of working-class Americans.\n\nResearchers have found that when the minimum wage in a state increased, or when states boosted a tax credit for working families, the suicide rate decreased.\n\nRaising the minimum wage and the earned-income tax credit (EITC) by 10 percent each could prevent about 1,230 suicides annually, according to a working paper circulated by the National Bureau of Economic Research this week.\n\nThe EITC was designed to boost the wages of low-income workers, particularly families with children. Many states have supplemented or expanded the credit.\n\n[Why do Democrats love trapezoids?]\n\nRaising the minimum wage and increasing the tax credit help less-educated, low-wage workers who have been hit hardest by what are now known as \"deaths of despair,\" according to the analysis of 1999-2015 death data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by University of California at Berkeley economists Anna Godoey and Michael Reich, as well as public-health specialists William Dow and Christopher Lowenstein.\n\nDeaths of despair, a phrase popularized by Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton in a pair of widely cited 2015 and 2017 papers, typically refers to rising death rates among middle-aged white non-Hispanic Americans.\n\nIn 2017, Case and Deaton wrote that those rising death rates can be attributed to \"drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related liver mortality -- particularly among those with a high school degree or less.\"\n\n[Opinion: The media gets the opioid crisis wrong. Here is the truth. (By Anne Case and Angus Deaton)]\n\nTo evaluate how policy choices could affect those deaths, the Berkeley team identified states that had raised their minimum wage or EITC between 1999 and 2015. They also included states whose wages were affected by federal minimum-wage increases. The researchers then measured the change in the rate for such deaths before and after the policies took effect.\n\nTo control for national trends, they compared the changes with states that hadn't changed their minimum wage or EITC.\n\nThe researchers looked at suicides and drug overdoses. Unlike degenerative liver disease linked to alcohol abuse, those events can be connected to a single point in time.\n\nThe team found little change in drug overdoses, whether intentional or accidental, after the new policies took effect. This falls in line with the growing consensus that, unlike other deaths of despair, drug overdoses probably are linked to increased availability of addictive (and lethal) drugs.\n\n[How fentanyl became the deadly street drug haunting America]\n\nBut the number of suicides that weren't related to drugs dropped noticeably. Among adults without a college education, increasing the EITC by 10 percent appears to have decreased non-drug suicides by about 5.5 percent. Raising the minimum wage by 10 percent reduced suicides by 3.6 percent.\n\n\"When they implement these policies, suicides fall very quickly,\" Godoey said in an interview.\n\nAlthough raising the minimum wage led to an immediate decrease in suicides, raising the EITC had a delayed effect, resulting in fewer suicides the following year, once the tax change came into force. In both cases, it appears as though taking home more money had a positive effect.\n\nThe effect was strongest among young women and others who were most likely to have minimum-wage jobs. Among men, black and Hispanic Americans saw the largest effect.\n\nThe Berkeley team is contributing to a larger body of work that links health, particularly mental health, with economic policy and outcomes.\n\nIn a 2014 analysis in American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, William Evans of the University of Notre Dame and Craig Garthwaite of Northwestern University found that mothers who received a higher EITC reported better mental and physical health.\n\nIn a paper to be published in American Economic Review: Insights, David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, David Dorn of the University of Zurich and Gordon Hanson of the University of California at San Diego drew on data from between 1990 and 2014 to find that the death rate among men tended to rise in cities where jobs were vanishing because of competition from cheap foreign goods.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fEmg7rXyBUYXdaUcxvqkQ3g2Fyg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GDOMAMDKYUI6TJTNVAWT6PMW2U.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4760566", "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 294330840}, {"uri": "1122611425", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-27", "time": "09:14:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-27T09:14:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/27/us/marijuana-california-legalization.html", "title": "'Getting Worse, Not Better': Illegal Pot Market Booming in California Despite Legalization", "body": "COSTA MESA, Calif. -- In the forests of Northern California, raids by law enforcement officials continue to uncover illicit marijuana farms. In Southern California, hundreds of illegal delivery services and pot dispensaries, some of them registered as churches, serve a steady stream of customers. And in Mendocino County, north of San Francisco, the sheriff's office recently raided an illegal cannabis production facility that was processing 500 pounds of marijuana a day.\n\nIt's been a little more than a year since California legalized marijuana -- the largest such experiment in the United States -- but law enforcement officials say the unlicensed, illegal market is still thriving and in some areas has even expanded.\n\n\"There's a lot of money to be made in the black market,\" said Thomas D. Allman, the sheriff of Mendocino County, whose deputies seized cannabis oil worth more than $5 million in early April.\n\nLegalization, Sheriff Allman said, \"certainly didn't put cops out of work.\"\n\nCalifornia's governor, Gavin Newsom, has declared that illegal grows in Northern California \"are getting worse, not better\" and two months ago redeployed a contingent of National Guard troops stationed on the border with Mexico to go after illegal cannabis farms instead.\n\nStepped-up enforcement comes with a certain measure of irony -- legalization was meant to open a new chapter for the state, free from the legacy of heavy policing and incarceration for minor infractions. Instead, there are new calls for a crackdown on illegal selling.\n\nConscious of the consequences that the war on drugs had on black and Latino communities, cities like Los Angeles today say they are wary of using criminal enforcement measures to police the illegal market and are unsure how to navigate this uncharted era.\n\nThe struggles of the licensed pot market in California are distinct from the experience of other states that have legalized cannabis in recent years. Sales in Colorado, Oregon and Washington grew well above 50 percent for each of the first three years of legalization, although Oregon now also has a large glut of pot.\n\nBut no other state has an illegal market on the scale of California's, and those illicit sales are cannibalizing the revenue of licensed businesses and in some cases, experts say, forcing them out of business.\n\nEntrepreneurs in the industry, which spent decades evading the law, are now turning to the law to demand the prosecution of unlicensed pot businesses.\n\n\"We are the taxpayers -- no one else should be operating,\" said Robert Taft Jr., whose licensed cannabis business in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, has seen sales drop in recent months.\n\n\"This is starting to get ridiculous,\" he said of the illegal pot shops, including nearby businesses that list themselves as churches and advertise marijuana as a kind of sacrament. \"It's almost like the state is setting itself up to lose.\"\n\nCalifornia gives cities wide latitude to regulate cannabis, resulting in a confusing patchwork of regulation. Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose and San Diego have laws allowing cannabis businesses, but most smaller cities and towns in the state do not -- 80 percent of California's nearly 500 municipalities do not allow retail marijuana businesses. The ballot measure legalizing recreational marijuana passed in 2016 with 57 percent approval, but that relatively broad support has not translated to the local level. Cities like Compton or Laguna Beach decisively rejected allowing pot shops.\n\nRegulators cite this tepid embrace by California municipalities as one of many reasons for the state's persistent and pervasive illegal market. Only 620 cannabis shops have been licensed in California so far. Colorado, with a population one-sixth the size of California, has 562 licensed recreational marijuana stores.\n\nBut the more fundamental reason for the strength of the black market in California -- and what sets the state apart from others -- is the huge surplus of pot. Since medical marijuana was made legal in California more than two decades ago, the cannabis industry flourished with minimal oversight. Now many cannabis businesses are reluctant to go through the cumbersome and costly process to obtain the licenses that became mandatory last year.\n\nOf the roughly 14 million pounds of marijuana grown in California annually, only a fraction -- less than 20 percent according to state estimates and a private research firm -- is consumed in California. The rest seeps out across the country illicitly, through the mail, express delivery services, private vehicles and small aircraft that ply trafficking routes that have existed for decades.\n\nThis illicit trade has been strengthened by the increasing popularity of vaping, cannabis-infused candies, tinctures and other derivative products. Vape cartridges are much easier to carry and conceal than bags of raw cannabis. And the monetary incentives of trafficking also remain powerful: The price of cannabis products in places like Illinois, New York or Connecticut are typically many times higher than in California.\n\nThe state's illicit cannabis exports appear to be increasing even now, well into California's second year of legalization. New Frontier Data, a data research company that specializes in cannabis, calculates that high demand and more advanced growing techniques will contribute to approximately half a million pounds more illicit cannabis this year compared with 2018.\n\nThe federal government still considers marijuana illegal and the Drug Enforcement Administration says it still investigates marijuana-related crimes. But a spokesman, Rusty Payne, said the agency has a bigger crisis to attend to.\n\n\"We've got our hands full with the opioid epidemic to be honest,\" Mr. Payne said.\n\nIn wildland areas, seizures of illicit pot by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife more than doubled in 2018, the first year that recreational cannabis was legal.\n\nThe department destroyed 1.6 million marijuana plants last year, up from 700,000 in 2017 and 800,000 the year before -- all of them illegally grown.\n\n\"There's a subset of people who are just refusing to get into the process,\" said Nathaniel Arnold, the department's deputy chief of enforcement.\n\nThe Bureau of Cannabis Control, the agency charged with regulating marijuana in the state, has received around 7,500 complaints, most of them about illegal operations, and has sent out more than 3,000 letters ordering illegal businesses to shut down.\n\n\"It's only a matter of time before we start making a dent in the illegal market,\" said Alex Traverso, a spokesman for the agency, who acknowledged there were probably more illegal shops in Los Angeles alone than licensed shops in the entire state.\n\nCat Packer, the executive director of the Department of Cannabis Regulation in Los Angeles, said that even when illicit businesses were shut down, they often soon reappeared.\n\n\"It's been a game of whack-a-mole in the city of Los Angeles,\" she said.\n\nBut Ms. Packer also said the city was mindful that criminal enforcement in the past had disproportionately targeted people of color.\n\nThe city is seeking to find an effective enforcement policy that does not mimic the criminal interdiction policies of the past, Ms. Packer said. One strategy is to turn off water and power services to noncompliant businesses.\n\n\"We can't do Drug War 2.0,\" she said.\n\nMr. Taft, the cannabis entrepreneur, has sent 450 complaints to the Bureau of Cannabis Control and is unapologetic about his calls for an aggressive approach to illegal shops, which he says is the only way that California's giant experiment will work.\n\nHis dispensary pays a cumulative state and local tax rate of 32.25 percent. Unlicensed shops pay no tax.\n\nOne of Mr. Taft's biggest complaints is about Weedmaps, a phone app that allows users to locate marijuana businesses nearby, both licensed and illegal.\n\nIn February last year, the Bureau of Cannabis Control sent a letter to Weedmaps saying the company was aiding and abetting illicit businesses and ordering it to \"immediately cease all activity that violates state cannabis laws.\"\n\nWeedmaps replied that it was a technology company and not under the jurisdiction of the bureau. More than a year later, the company still lists hundreds of unlicensed shops.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Taft resigned as a board member of the Santa Ana Cannabis Association because half the members, he said, were selling illegally and using legalization as a \"shield.\"\n\n\"They are playing both sides of the market,\" he said.\n\nOn a recent weekday morning, Mr. Taft called the Bureau of Cannabis Control to lodge a complaint against his neighbor, a cannabis business that he said did not appear on the list of licensed businesses.\n\n\"We are being pillaged by these people,\" he said. \"My lawyers are ready to launch rockets!\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_fuller@nytimes.com", "name": "Thomas Fuller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/25/us/00cannabis-02/00cannabis-02-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4753024", "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 294052440}, {"uri": "1122302166", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-26", "time": "20:28:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-26T20:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6392157077789307, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/nonprofits-shoudnt-be-so-quick-to-reject-funds-from-tainted-donors/2019/04/26/9fbaa8ba-62db-11e9-bfad-36a7eb36cb60_story.html", "title": "Opinion | Nonprofits shoudn't be so quick to reject funds from tainted donors", "body": "By David Allyn April 26 at 4:09 PM\n\nDavid Allyn is vice president at Graham-Pelton, a fundraising and management consulting firm for nonprofit organizations, and a visiting scholar at the New School for Social Research.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, the National Portrait Gallery in London and the Tate museums, also in London, have all announced that they will no longer accept gifts from the Sackler family. Some Sackler family members are owners of Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, and have been accused of facilitating the national opioid epidemic. Purdue has denied allegations like those made by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey . But it's probably only a matter of time before the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Harvard University and other institutions make similar announcements as well.\n\nThe allegations by Healey and other attorneys general are serious, and the impulse of these institutions to say no to Sackler money is noble. Or, at the very least, savvy public relations.\n\nThese days, brands are expected to be pure, and any hint of corruption or moral compromise can easily trigger protests and harsh online backlash. The threat is as real for nonprofits as it is for celebrities and cosmetics companies.\n\nBut as a former nonprofit chief executive, and someone who now counsels nonprofits on fundraising, I believe that the rush to reject funds from tainted donors is often shortsighted. Nonprofit organizations serve the public interest and should not readily cave in to pressure to return gifts from controversial sources.\n\nThe pressure on organizations to say no to contributions from tainted donors is enormous. Well-meaning activists can quickly marshal vast opposition to an institution. And no organization wants to be accused of taking \"blood money\" -- as the University of Southern California was in 2017 in a Change.org petition , when the university announced a pledge of $5 million from Harvey Weinstein to support female filmmakers.\n\nNot surprisingly, USC leaders quickly reversed course and said they would not take Weinstein's pledged funds. But was it better that Weinstein got to keep his $5 million? Or would that money have done more for the world by nurturing the careers of young female filmmakers?\n\nU.S. charities receive more than $400 billion in donations annually, much of it coming from the ultrawealthy. How many of the ultrawealthy have truly clean hands? And how many of their donations could withstand scrutiny by the online \"cancel culture\" as it grows in fervor and power? Nonprofits themselves are increasingly likely to come under inspection and subject to cancellation.\n\nGiven these factors, the question of ethical gift acceptance will only become more and more urgent. It is critical to recognize that there are distinct types of challenges facing nonprofits.\n\nWithout a doubt, institutions should return money if it was not the donor's to give away - taking stolen property is unacceptable. Accordingly, in 2001, the University of Oregon returned an $850,000 donation from financier Jeff Grayson after a court ruled that the money wasn't even his.\n\nWhat about taking money when a gift seems to be a mere public-relations move by a known wrongdoer? Even the most notorious individuals may have complex motives for contributing to certain causes, and institutions may have complex rationales for accepting the money, but they should balk at slapping a tainted donor's name on a building or program in a quid pro quo for funds.\n\nWhat about anonymous gifts from donors who may have done as much good as they have done evil? It seems inevitable that activists will soon want organizations to reject all money from tainted donors, even gifts that would be publicly designated as anonymous. Already some have argued that anonymity itself is dangerous.\n\nBut a more moderate approach is warranted. First, remember that any money given to a nonprofit ultimately is good for society as a whole. That's why nonprofit organizations are deemed by the Internal Revenue Service to be \"public benefit corporations.\"\n\nWe live in a society that provides limited public funding for social welfare programs. Most arts organizations and social service agencies rely on charitable giving. When nonprofits reject funds from donors -- tainted or otherwise -- we all pay a price. The nonprofit may ultimately be forced to cut back programming, sell property, spend more of its endowment or invest more of its resources in fundraising.\n\nWould you rather visit a new Sackler-funded wing at a museum or see the Sacklers buy another private home?\n\nSome have argued that cultural institutions, instead of returning funds to the Sacklers, should re-donate the money to drug-rehabilitation programs. The idea seems appealing at first, but imagine if the owners of Purdue Pharma had donated directly to a drug-rehabilitation program. The program's directors would no doubt face extraordinary pressure to return the donation amid cries of hypocrisy and reputation-laundering.\n\nLet's not put the goal of shaming wrongdoers above the goal of furthering the common good. Despite activist anger and social media self-righteousness, until governments step up their funding, we would do well to support nonprofits in taking a nuanced, thoughtful approach to the ethics of gift acceptance.\n\nJillian Sackler: Stop blaming my late husband, Arthur Sackler, for the opioid crisis\n\nLetters to the Editor: Blame Arthur Sackler, after all\n\nHugh Eakin: For better or worse, our greatest museums are built on the backs of billionaires\n\nCynthia Wachtell: How to stop the opioid crisis\n\nRobert Gebelhoff: The opioid crisis is too big for justice to stop with the Sackler family", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TObGe8yPDQ_ROGxStlzFSzgaNLk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4QSU5SC4SII6TFRFAHKI2UHPOU.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4754363", "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 294006480}, {"uri": "1122301315", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-26", "time": "20:27:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-26T20:27:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/your-money/notre-dame-donation-backlash-philanthropy.html", "title": "Notre-Dame Donation Backlash Raises Debate: What's Worthy of Philanthropy?", "body": "As flames engulfed Notre-Dame, people from around the world opened their wallets and began making donations. Within two days, nearly $1 billion was raised to help pay for the restoration of the 856-year-old cathedral in Paris.\n\nThe charitable response was a reflection of Notre-Dame's stature as a cherished monument of French cultural heritage. Some benefactors pledged more than $100 million each, including Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, whose wealth comes from luxury brands like Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, and Bernard Arnault, the richest person in Europe and chief executive of the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH.\n\nBut the outpouring met with resistance as critics wondered why tragedies like the incineration of the National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro in September did not receive the same degree of support. And it rekindled class resentment in a city already racked by the so-called Yellow Vest movement, a populist response to economic inequality in France that tapped into a rising global movement against the concentration of wealth.\n\nSome criticism was aimed at donors for not paying their fair share in taxes and thus depriving the French government of the revenue to repair Notre-Dame itself. Others denounced the reputational boost bestowed on philanthropists at a time of national tragedy. And some attacked the premise of giving so much to a damaged cathedral when that money could better benefit social service organizations that could provide food, shelter or a better education to needy citizens.\n\nBut philanthropic experts and advisers said they were not shocked by what seemed like an ungrateful response.\n\n\"It's not surprising,\" said Nicolas Berggruen, a billionaire philanthropist who founded the Berggruen Institute in Los Angeles, which aims to reshape political and social institutions to develop long-term solutions to society's challenges. \"In the age of anxiety, people will look to accuse lots of different groups for all of the evil or some of the evil. Rich people for sure fall into this. Philanthropists are an extension of that.\"\n\nOthers took a less philosophical approach, saying that for society to be most effective, philanthropists need to work with government and the private sector, not alone or in opposition to them.\n\n\"Instead of praising the act of philanthropy itself, people are saying it's not the highest and best use of that capital,\" said Nick Tedesco, senior philanthropic adviser at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. \"When did we get to a place where we feel comfortable criticizing other people's altruism?\"\n\nIf such critical responses toward prominent donations becomes a trend, donors could be forced to rethink big gifts. Some are worried that could have a chilling effect on giving, while others hope it forces people to think differently about what their money supports.\n\nThose who are worried about the backlash think anger over unequal distribution of wealth is bleeding into the wrong areas.\n\n\"There's a lot of understandable concern about wealth inequality and a lot of concern about the bad behavior of some,\" said Phil Buchanan, chief executive of the Center for Effective Philanthropy and the author of \"Giving Done Right.\"\n\n\"But I worry that we're conflating concerns over our approach to taxation with a critique of philanthropy, and I don't actually follow the logic,\" he added. \"I don't believe most big philanthropists are motivated by a desire to maintain the status quo via their giving or to protect themselves from higher taxation.\"\n\nHe said private philanthropic organizations like the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation supported ideas that had become part of the social fabric, like the 911 emergency system and the field of nurse practitioners. And the Libra Foundation, which is backed by a part of the Pritzker family, supplied $350,000 in grants to organizations addressing the needs of families being separated at the United States-Mexico border.\n\nMr. Buchanan said that to solve social problems, all three sectors of society -- public, private and philanthropic -- needed to do the jobs they were meant to do at a high level, not be sidetracked by a backlash.\n\n\"What I'm more concerned about is the broad-brush critique of the whole concept of giving and the under-appreciation of all the good giving has done,\" he said. \"We need a healthy civil society doing different things.\"\n\nMr. Tedesco had a different concern: that already too much money earmarked for philanthropy was not being put to use.\n\n\"With Notre-Dame, you were able to tap into otherwise dormant philanthropic capital,\" he said. \"But that leads to the question: Why is philanthropic capital lying idle? The nonprofit organizations don't know how to compel donors to give.\"\n\nInstead of shying from criticism, philanthropists should accept it as the cost of trying out new things that may not work, Mr. Tedesco said. \"You should be more willing to own that criticism because it shows you're attempting to find solutions or approaches that will ultimately get to success.\"\n\nBut for those who would rather avoid backlash, anonymity is always an option. Caroline W. Hodkinson, director of philanthropic advisory at Bessemer Trust, said some of the firm's wealthiest clients were opting to use limited liability companies to hold money that was earmarked for philanthropy but that could also be used for impact investing. The investment vehicles give donors greater flexibility over how the money is managed, but they also provide near-total anonymity.\n\n\"A private foundation is about the least private thing you can have,\" she said. By meeting Internal Revenue Service reporting requirements, \"you're opening up your affairs to the world,\" she said.\n\nAnonymity on large gifts is also fairly easy to arrange. \"It's a business negotiation,\" said Jared Feldman, who, as the partner in charge of the private client group at the accounting firm Anchin, has worked on four gifts of more than $100 million each.\n\nBut anonymity presents a problem because of its inherent lack of transparency.\n\n\"I'm concerned about the anonymity issue,\" said Lawson Bader, chief executive of DonorsTrust, a donor-advised fund. Knowing who a benefactor is helps build trust, he said, whereas anonymity can hide potential conflicts. For instance, museums are re-examining gifts from the Sackler family, a prominent donor in the art world, after its involvement in the opioid crisis became known. Had the donations been made anonymously, they would not be under scrutiny now.\n\nSome critics hope that the backlash goes beyond assessing the merits of certain donors and donations and instead forces a wholesale re-evaluation of philanthropy.\n\nAnand Giridharadas, author of \"Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World,\" said he found the criticism of the donations to Notre-Dame healthy and wanted to see more of it. \"I've been advocating for exactly that kind of reaction,\" he said. \"It is not hostility to giving. It's simply an injection of skepticism about this kind of exertion of power.\"\n\nWhen philanthropists, particularly in the tech world, make sweeping pronouncements like Mark Zuckerberg's $3 billion plan to cure all disease, Mr. Giridharadas said, society needs to tone down its adulation and be skeptical.\n\nMr. Giridharadas said he would like to see philanthropists make gifts instead to organizations that shake up the social order. \"The kind of giving I advocate is 'being a traitor to your class' giving,\" he said.\n\nUnlike Mr. Giridharadas, who supports shaking up norms, Mr. Berggruen is focused on helping democracies work better by drawing on the best philanthropic traditions.\n\n\"What philanthropists have done in America is much more to put their money to use in society,\" he said. \"The state has a role, but Bill Gates can take more risk than the private sector can and take different kinds of risk than the state can take. In America, on the whole, that's been beneficial.\"\n\nAside from the backlash, the debate stirred by the donations to Notre-Dame has also raised hope.\n\n\"The takeaway form Notre-Dame is, if that can happen in 24 hours, the resources are there to take on major issues,\" said Rob Hansen, founder of Goodnation, which measures the impact of donations. \"Imagine instead of redirecting that billion dollars, we raise another billion dollars to other causes.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_sullivan@nytimes.com", "name": "Paul Sullivan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/26/business/26wealth1/26wealth1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 294006420}, {"uri": "1121511353", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-25", "time": "22:51:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-25T22:51:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/04/25/opioid-epidemic-was-no-mistake-it-is-result-complicity-greed/", "title": "Opinion | The opioid epidemic is no mistake.

(Kathy Willens/AP) By Robert Gebelhoff Robert Gebelhoff Opinions contributor focusing on health, science and public policy. Assistant editor and Opinions contributor April 25 at 6:20 PM\n\nIn September 2015, an employee of Rochester Drug Cooperative (RDC), one of the largest pharmaceutical distributors in the country, was preparing to review a report on the opioid drugs her company had sold to one of its pharmacy customers. Given the buzz in the office, she was steeling herself, as she put it in an email, to see \"what evil lies within,\" referring to evidence that her company's highly addictive products were falling into the wrong hands. Despite the report, the company allegedly did nothing to stop that illicit flow of drugs.\n\nThat email text can be found within a criminal complaint against RDC filed in federal court this week -- and you get a similar sense of dread as you read through the complaint. Given earlier revelations about the opioid epidemic, we knew there would be ugly allegations. Yet, the evil alleged in the document is still staggering, adding to the argument that the opioid epidemic was no mistake. Instead, it is the result of shocking complicity and greed.\n\nThe criminal complaint is a momentous development. It offers the first chance of seeing an executive in the drug distribution industry go to prison for his role in our overdose crisis. Prosecutors charged the New York company and two of its executives with three crimes, including conspiracy to distribute controlled narcotics for nonmedical reasons. The company does not dispute the charges, nor has William Pietruszewski, the company's former chief of compliance, who has agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with prosecutors. The company's former chief executive, Laurence F. Doud III, maintains his innocence, and his lawyer told The Post that he will \"fight these false charges to his last breath.\"\n\nBut the charges are breathtaking. Prosecutors say RDC's executives were repeatedly warned by their staff that their products were being diverted to illicit markets on a huge scale. As early as February 2013, a contractor who conducted pharmacy audits for RDC advised management that the opioid products being dispensed to some of its pharmacy customers were \"like a stick of dynamite waiting for DEA to light the fuse,\" according to the complaint.\n\nIn the case described by RDC's employee as potentially \"evil,\" the complaint notes, the company's compliance staff had found that, between October 2013 and February 2014, 88 percent of that pharmacy's oxycodone 30 mg sales were paid for in cash. Compliance employees also found that the doctors writing the most prescriptions for the painkillers were located in a different state from the pharmacy, and that RDC had identified other doctors on an internal \"Watch List\" for having engaged in suspicious activities.\n\nAnd yet, prosecutors say, the company continued to fill those suspicious orders. Between May 2012 and November 2016, the complaint says, RDC fulfilled more than 1.5 million orders for opioids. During that entire period, it reported only four suspicious orders to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nIt's baffling to imagine that an executive could think he or she could get away with such alleged negligence, given that the DEA clearly notifies them of their legal responsibility to flag suspicious orders. But a few numbers offer some important context: In the time period that prosecutors investigated, RDC's revenue from sales of controlled substances nearly quadrupled. In the meantime, the compensation of its then-chief executive, Doud, surged to $1.5 million a year.\n\nThe company, for its part, agreed to pay a $20 million fine over five years. And an RDC spokesman acknowledged in a statement that the company \"made mistakes ... directed by former management\" that will have \"serious consequences.\"\n\nFor that frankness, we owe the company some gratitude. For too long, the public has seen the epidemic as the result of irresponsible doctors or the product of economic malaise. It may be true that doctors became too lax with their prescribing practices, but research has repeatedly shown that prescription drugs, under proper medical supervision, can safely manage pain without leading to addiction.\n\nWhy, then, did we have an outbreak in addiction? Because opioids were being taken without proper supervision. They were being diverted illegally to black markets. And, it seems, the largest conduit for that traffic, on a scale of tens of millions of pills, was right in front of us -- through a corrupt pharmaceutical supply chain.\n\nAnd it's not just RDC that has faced such allegations. For example, McKesson Corp., the largest pharmaceutical distributor in the country, was similarly investigated for fulfilling highly suspicious orders of painkillers to pharmacists. McKesson was not charged with a crime (over investigators' objections), but the DEA has fined it twice for its opioid distribution practices.\n\nThis is how prescription opioids flooded communities across the country, leading to heroin abuse and the fentanyl disaster we have today. This is the evil that was within.\n\nWe won't solve our opioid crisis by putting drug executives in prison. But we might find hope in these small acts of justice. Perhaps such sentences will be the chemotherapy that begins to treat the whole drug supply chain's cancerous complicity.\n\nJillian Sackler: Stop blaming my late husband, Arthur Sackler, for the opioid crisis\n\nRobert Gebelhoff: The opioid crisis is too big for justice to stop with the Sackler family\n\nJuliette Kayyem: Congress created tools to fight the opioid crisis.
