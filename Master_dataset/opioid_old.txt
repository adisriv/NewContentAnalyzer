Roy Blunt (D-Mo.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) discuss mental heath at a Washington Post Live event.\n\nActress Glenn Close still remembers vividly the dramatic and troubling scene when her nephew, Calen, had a psychotic break as a 17-year-old living in Montana.\n\n\"He had to be put in a straitjacket and driven two hours to the closest place where he could get help,\" Close said at a Washington Post Live event yesterday.\n\nThe lack of accessible help for Calen -- and that he had to go to the emergency room instead of getting treatment prior -- is part of the reason she's asking Congress to expand and extend funding for mental health care through a pilot program scheduled to expire on July 1.\n\nClose became a mental health advocate after encountering serious illness within her own family -- not just Calen, who has schizophrenia, but also her sister Jessie, diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychotic tendencies.\n\nShe's backing a program approved five years ago under a bill from Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), which the senators are now trying to expand from eight states to 19 states for another two years. The bill gives extra Medicaid dollars to community clinics in return for providing a wide range of mental health services. Its aim is to correct a shortcoming in the country's health-care system, which often prioritizes care for physical ailments but not for mental conditions such as depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder.\n\nUnder the pilot, more than 350 health clinics serving a quarter-million Medicaid patients have been able to get fully reimbursed by the federal government for the full range of mental health care. If funding isn't extended, the centers may have to lay off 3,000 newly hired staff, cut off medication-assisted treatment to 9,000 patients and reestablish wait lists for mental health services, according to estimates provided by the senators' offices.\n\n\"We have seen psychiatric crisis services, 24-hour services, start up in the community,\" Stabenow said. \"So, someone's not going to the jail, someone's not sitting in emergency room for hours or maybe days trying to get help, and it's transforming those communities.\"\n\nDiagnoses of mental illness are on the rise in the United States, particularly among youth. Substance abuse, which often goes hand in hand with mental illness, has also spiked. Yet a large share of people don't get the help they need, due to a variety of reasons including stigma, insufficient insurance coverage and the unique nature of mental illness, which can discourage patients from seeking care independently.\n\nThat was the case for Close's sister and her nephew. She described her shock when Jessie confided in her that she couldn't stop thinking about killing herself.\n\n\"Our family had absolutely no vocabulary for mental health,\" Close said. \"We just -- we didn't really get it...I had no clue. She was very good at keeping what she was going through from all of us.\"\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimates that half of adults and teens with any mental illness and one-third of adults with serious mental illness don't get any kind of treatment. Blunt and Stabenow's bill tries to get at the problem by expanding mental health services covered via Medicaid, the government program for the low income which is also the single-largest payer of mental health services in the United States.\n\nTo be eligible for the increased Medicaid payments, a clinic must be certified as a Community Behavioral Health Clinic. That involves showing it provides a comprehensive set of services including 24-hour crisis counseling, substance abuse treatment and mental illness screenings. Part of the idea is to make treatment more readily available to patients before they end up in emergency rooms or in the criminal justice system.\n\n\"For the better part of 50 years the emergency room and law enforcement have been the de facto mental health delivery system in the country,\" Blunt said. \"And nobody is well served by that or satisfied by that.\"\n\nStabenow said she'll never forget when the sheriff in Cook County, Ill., told her he had just hired a psychiatrist as a jail director.\n\n\"He said, 'Well, it's real simple. Over half the people in my jail have mental health problems,' \" Stabenow recalled.\n\nThen there's the issue of stigma, a major reason people don't seek out help before their illnesses make it hard to function. Both Jessie and Calen found the stigma around their illnesses was \"just as painful\" as dealing with the illnesses themselves, Close said.\n\n\"Calen lost all his friends,\" Close said. \"Jessie felt that she was frightened to tell parents about her bipolar disorder because she was afraid they wouldn't allow their children to come and play with her young daughter at the time.\"\n\nThere are signs that the stigma is starting to thin, as more public figures share their own experiences. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), took to the Senate floor on Wednesday to share her struggle with depression that started in college and returned in her 30s. She described the experience as a \"spiral\" and called herself \"one of the lucky ones\" because she had insurance that allowed her to see a therapist.\n\n\"Down and down I went, until I could no longer see hope on the horizon,\" Smith said. \"Now, I was never suicidal, but I was struggling to function. I definitely wasn't living my best life; I really wasn't living at all. And that's the reality for mental illness for millions of Americans.\"\n\nBut talking more about mental illness has raised another concern among advocates: that it's possible to address the topic in unhelpful ways, ways that could even trigger people to act upon suicidal thoughts. The Netflix series \"13 Reasons Why\" recently came under scrutiny when a study purported to find a spike in youth suicides in the month after the show was released.\n\nClose called the series \"irresponsible.\"\n\n\"My sister went through suicide ideation,\" Close said. \"She tried to end her life twice. And I think you have to take responsibility because there's so much potential for impact with our social media. You really have to take responsibility for the stories that you tell.\"\n\nAHH: It took 18 days last fall for the University of Maryland to inform its students about the presence on campus of adenovirus. It's a virus that can appear with symptoms similar to a cold or flu but can be dangerous for people with weakened immune systems, making early detection critical.\n\nThe outbreak left one student, 18-year-old Olivia Shea Paregol, dead.\n\nMore than 40 students were sickened overall during the outbreak in November and December and 15 people were treated at hospitals, our Post colleagues Jenn Abelson, Amy Brittain and Sarah Larimer report in this investigation about the outbreak told through Olivia's story. The reporters spoke with more than 100 people during the course of their reporting to explain how the university's communication delay left the community in the dark.\n\nAfter learning of the virus's presence on campus, university officials \"discussed -- but decided against -- notifying students with compromised immune systems and residents living in Elkton Hall, according to records reviewed by The Washington Post,\" our colleagues write.\n\n\"Many parents and students have denounced the administration's handling of the viral outbreak and the mold infestation, complaining its actions endangered thousands of students, faculty and staff on campus,\" they add. \"In recent statements to The Post, university officials defended their actions ... They said they went beyond what was legally required to address the adenovirus outbreak and public health officials advised that it was not necessary to inform the public about the virus.\"\n\nOOF: Five states -- Virginia, Maryland, Kansas, Iowa and Wisconsin -- said they will sue opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma and members of the Sackler family that controls the company, for allegedly \"deceptively pushing powerful painkillers and misrepresenting the drugs' safety as the pills sparked the opioid crisis,\" our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports.\n\nThe five states join at least 40 others that have filed suits against companies that are in some way involved in the making, distributing and dispensing of opioid drugs. Another 1,600 counties, cities and Native American tribes have filed claims that have been consolidated in a massive federal lawsuit in Cleveland.\n\n\"All but Kansas targeted at least one member of the Sackler family, former president Richard Sackler, and Maryland named seven family members but not the company in an administrative filing,\" Lenny writes. \"In a news conference, West Virginia's attorney general, Patrick Morrisey said his state was seeking to hold both the company and Richard Sackler responsible for deaths and other harms from the worst drug epidemic in U.S. history.\"\n\n\"Even when it became apparent that thousands of people were dying of opioid abuse, Purdue doubled down by continuing its relentless and deceptive campaign\" to push physicians to prescribe OxyContin, Morrisey said at the news conference.\n\nOUCH: The Ebola outbreak is only getting worse in Congo, as is widespread fear among health workers trying to combat the outbreak. The death toll has reached 1,136 this week, and the number of infections rose to 1,632.\n\nMisinformation has driven distrust of those in medical uniforms, making some doctors battling what is the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history afraid to wear their scrubs, as our Post colleagues Danielle Paquette and Lena H. Sun report.\n\nThere have been 119 attacks this year against health workers, according to the World Health Organization, with 85 people wounded or killed.\n\n\"And the violence hampers the response effort in a more direct way: Ebola infections tend to spike after attacks, experts say, because emergency responders are forced to take cover and halt the distribution of immunity-boosting vaccinations,\" Danielle and Lena write. \"Concerns are growing that the crisis in Congo's North Kivu province could become as lethal as West Africa's battle against the hemorrhagic fever from 2013 to 2016, which killed 11,310 people across three countries.\"\n\n-- House Democrats passed legislation yesterday to lower prescription drug prices and to reverse some changes made by the Trump administration around the Affordable Care Act, a move that sets up the Democratic Party with yet another chance to tout a health-care message ahead of the 2020 election, our Post colleague Amy Goldstein reports.\n\nIn a 234-183 vote, five GOP members joined every Democrat in passing legislation to block rules from the Trump administration meant to encourage people to buy cheaper, short-term health plans that typically cover fewer services. The legislation also restores funding for advertising and other outreach to help people sign up for ACA marketplace plans. The package also includes three strategies to boost the availability of generic drugs, measures that initially had Republican support before Democrats packaged them with the measures to reinforce the ACA.\n\n\"The upshot was a barbed debate: Democrats accused Republicans of disregarding consumers' need for affordable, quality health care, and Republicans accused Democrats of thwarting a rare opportunity for bipartisanship,\" Amy writes.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) Pelosi also took a jab yesterday at the Senate, which is not planning to consider the legislation.\n\n\"I have some news for the distinguished leader in the Senate, the Republican leader,\" she said. \"The support for these bills is alive and well among the American people. He will be hearing from them because these bills are a matter of life and death and certainly quality of life for America's working families.\"\n\n-- Gilead Sciences CEO Daniel O'Day defended the high cost of the manufacturer's highly effective HIV treatment, Truvada, before a House committee yesterday.\n\n\"We have taken the disease from a death sentence to a manageable clinical condition, but we're not done yet,\" O'Day said. \"We have to be sure that Americans get our medicines at a price that allows us to invest in research.''\n\nDuring the hearing, lawmakers questioned the high cost of the drug and noted it was research conducted by governent scientists at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that helped develop Truvada, as our Post colleague Christopher Rowland reports.\n\n\"This treatment was developed as a result of investment made by the American taxpayers. The problem is that Gilead, the company that now sells the drug, charges astronomical prices,'' House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said. He pointed to how the price has shifted from $800 a month when it was introduced in 2004 to now about $2,000 a month. \"How can Gilead do this? How can our system allow a company to take a drug treatment that was developed with taxpayer funds and abuse its monopoly to charge such astronomical prices?''\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) asked O'Day why the drug's list price is nearly $2,000 in the United States when it's $8 in Australia.\n\n\"Truvada still has patent protection in the United States, and in the rest of the world it is generic,\" O'Day said. \"I can't comment on the price in Australia of the generic medicines, but it is generically available in other parts of the world and will be generically available in the United States as of September in 2020.\" Christopher notes that scheduled generic availability is set to slash the company's current earnings of $3 billion a year from the drug.\n\n-- House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he opposes the new Alabama law that effectively bans all abortions in the state, saying it \"goes further than I believe.\"\n\n\"I believe in exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother, and that's what I've voted on,\" McCarthy said at his weekly news conference, as our Post colleagues Felicia Sonmez and Mike DeBonis report. He said rape and incest exemptions are \"exactly what Republicans have voted on in this House.\"\n\nHis remarks came the day after Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) signed what is the country's strictest antiabortion law, outlawing abortions without any exceptions for rape or incest and which penalizes doctors who perform the procedure with up to 99 years in prison.\n\n\"Republicans are wary of a reprise of 2012, when they lost two key Senate races in Indiana and Missouri after the party's nominees in those states made comments about pregnancies resulting from rape,\" Felicia and Mike write. \"The debate over the Alabama law also comes at a time when Republicans are looking to make inroads with suburban women, a voting bloc that they lost when Democrats recaptured the House in 2018.\"\n\n-- Missouri's Republican-controlled Senate made the state the latest in a slew of states to pass strict antiabortion legislation. Republican lawmakers voted 24 to 10 to pass a bill to ban abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe bill is now headed to the state's Republican-controlled House, as our Post colleague Lindsey Bever reports. Republican Gov. Mike Parson has expressed support for the measure.\n\nParson tweeted before the bill's Senate vote:\n\nThe bill would penalize any doctor who performs the procedure with up to 15 years in prison. It includes no exceptions for rape or incest, and only allows women to get an abortion after the eighth week of pregnancy in cases of medical emergencies, which it defines as \"a condition which, based on reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert the death of the pregnant woman or for which a delay will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.\"\n\nIn a statement to The Post, M'Evie Mead, director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Missouri, said the GOP lawmakers \"are putting the health and lives of Missouri women at risk in their race to make our state the one that overturns Roe v. Wade at the Supreme Court.\"\n\nSen.

It was not immediately clear which states were targeting Richard Sackler, the former president of the company, as well as the company itself.\n\nIn a news conference, West Virginia's attorney general, Patrick Morriseysaid his state was seeking to hold both the company and Sacklers responsible for deaths and other harms from the worst drug epidemic in U.S. history.\n\n\"Even when it became apparent that thousands of people were dying of opioid abuse, Purdue doubled down by continuing its relentless and deceptive campaign\" to persuade doctors to write prescriptions for its powerful narcotic, OxyContin, Morrisey said.\n\nAt least thirty-six other states have sued companies involved in manufacturing, distributing and dispensing opioids. About 1,600 cities, counties, Native American tribes and others have also filed claims that have been consolidated in an enormous federal lawsuit in Cleveland.\n\nMorrisey said his state's lawsuit would be filed there, but some of the other states would join the large \"multidistrict litigation\" in Ohio.\n\nSpokesmen for Purdue and Sackler did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday morning.\n\nIn March, Purdue agreed to a $270 million out-of-court settlement with the state of Oklahoma, where the company faced its first trial on these issues at the end of May. Some of that money will be paid by members of the Sackler family.\n\nLast week, Purdue won a victory in state court when a North Dakota judge dismissed the state's lawsuit against Purdue.\n\nPurdue's president and chief executive, Craig Landau, said in March that declaring bankruptcy is an option the company might have to explore if jury verdicts or settlements become too costly.\n\nOverdoses caused by opioids are responsible for more than 400,000 deaths since 1999, with about half from prescription narcotics, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThursday's announcement came a day after New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art became the latest cultural institution to say it would no longer accept donations from members of the Sackler family, who are major philanthropists to art museums and educational institutions.\n\nThe legal actions add to the list of states seeking compensation for the deaths and damage from the two-decade old drug crisis that began after Purdue introduced its powerful painkiller, OxyContin, in 1996, and aggressively promoted the drug to physicians for a wide variety of aches and pains.\n\nIn documents released in February as part of its lawsuit, Massachusetts alleged that members of the Sackler family directed sales representatives to push extremely high doses of the drug.\n\nThe state's attorney general, Maura Healy accused the company of engaging in frequent acts of deception and misconduct to make as much money as possible, even as OxyContin launched the crisis and its toll of addiction and death. In a court filing responding to the lawsuit, lawyers for members of the Sackler family said Healey's lawsuit contains \"misleading and inflammatory allegations\" and takes internal company emails out of context.\n\nNew York also has targeted the Sackler family in its lawsuit.\n\nIn 2007, Purdue and three of its executives pleaded guilty to criminal charges of misleading doctors, regulators and the public about the dangers of the drug and collectively paid $635 million in fines.\n\nMorrisey noted that West Virginia had previously sued Purdue in 2001, recouping $10 million in a settlement with the company.

It announced it would no longer take donations from members of the Sackler family linked to OxyContin. \"On occasion, we feel it's necessary to step away from gifts that are not in the public interest,\" Daniel H. Weiss, the Met's president, said.\n\n\"Gifts that are not in the public interest.\" It is a pregnant, important phrase. Coming on the heels of similar decisions by the Tate Modern in London and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, the spurning of Oxy-cash seems to reflect a growing awareness that gifts to the arts and other good causes are not only a way for ultra-wealthy people to scrub their consciences and reputations. Philanthropy can also be central to purchasing the immunity needed to profiteer at the expense of the common welfare.\n\nPerhaps accepting tainted money in such cases isn't just giving people a pass. Perhaps it is enabling misconduct against the public.\n\nThis was the startling assertion made by New York State in its civil complaint, filed in March, against members of the Sackler family and others involved in the opioid crisis. It accused defendants of seeking to \"profiteer from the plague they knew would be unleashed.\" And the lawsuit explicitly linked Sackler do-gooding with Sackler harm-doing: \"Ultimately, the Sacklers used their ill-gotten wealth to cover up their misconduct with a philanthropic campaign intending to whitewash their decades-long success in profiting at New Yorkers' expense.\"\n\nIt was strong stuff. The State of New York officially claiming that in taking Sackler money, arts institutions had allowed themselves to be used as lubricant in a death machine. \"It's a remarkable statement,\" Benjamin Soskis, a historian of philanthropy at the Urban Institute in Washington, told me this week, \"the sort of thing we heard from critics of philanthropy on the periphery of power but rarely, in recent decades, from those at the center.\"\n\nAre museums, opera houses, food pantries and other nonprofits to be held responsible for how their donors have made their money? It is a question being asked more and more as a century-old taboo shatters.\n\n\"No amount of charity in spending such fortunes can compensate in any way for the misconduct in acquiring them,\" Theodore Roosevelt said after John D. Rockefeller proposed to start a foundation in 1909. It was not a lonely thought at the time.\n\nBut in the decades since, not least because of the amount of philanthropic coin that has been spent (can it still be called bribing when millions are the recipients?), touching all corners of our cultural life, attitudes have changed. And, as I found in spending the last few years reporting on nonprofits and foundations, a deeply complicit silence took hold: It was understood that you don't challenge people on how they make their money, how they pay their taxes (or don't), what continuing deeds they may be engaged in -- so long as they \"give back.\"\n\nWhen I speak privately with people working in nonprofits, as I often do, especially younger people, I hear this complaint again and again: They agonize about having to stay quiet not only about their donors' membership in a class that has benefited from an age of inequality but also about specific conduct by many donors that often worsens the problems the donors and nonprofits are working to solve.\n\nAnd so the decision by the Met and the other museums may be a small sign that this compact is cracking -- and perhaps that nonprofits are taking a broader view of their role in public life: not only as doers of good in a particular area of work but also, if they're not careful, as enablers of broader, if more generalized, societal harm.\n\n\"Turning down money runs against the grain of the thinking that's long governed charitable boards -- that they are stewards of the interests of particular institutions, with considerations of broader public interest being peripheral,\" Mr. Soskis, the historian, said when I asked him about the Met. \"What we are seeing more and more of, through the spread of social media, and an increased willingness to critically engage major philanthropic gifts, is the assertion of the public's interest in the philanthropic exchange.\"\n\nRelatedMore on the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma.The Met Will Turn Down Sackler Money Amid Fury Over the Opioid CrisisMay 15, 2019Opinion | Barry Meier: Opioid Makers Are the Big Winners in Lawsuit SettlementsDec. 26, 2018Origins of an Epidemic: Purdue Pharma Knew Its Opioids Were Widely AbusedMay 29, 2018\n\nIt remains to be seen whether other arts institutions will follow the lead of the Met, Tate and Guggenheim -- and more broadly, whether the nonprofit sector will begin asking itself some deeply uncomfortable questions. Should anyone working to make cities better and more equitable take money from JPMorgan Chase, which paid a huge sum for its role in helping to bring about the 2008 mortgage disaster and financial crisis? Should anyone working to help families affected by President Trump's immigration policies take money from Mark Zuckerberg, whose soft-pedaling of Russian interference in the 2016 election allowed anti-immigrant hate to spread and potentially helped Trump gain votes? Should any health institution take money tied to Pepsi or Coca-Cola?\n\nMake no mistake: To ask these questions opens a can of worms. The Sacklers are an easy case. Once the complicity turns more diffuse, it is hard to say whether a nonprofit is participating in an injustice by taking money -- or doing the best it can in a flawed reality. What's next after this? Is there a statute of limitations on looking for blood money? What kind of moral purity test are these institutions supposed to use? Once you begin to raise these dilemmas, how do you actually draw those lines around what's acceptable?\n\nThe Met has already drawn some lines. It won't remove the Sackler name from its galleries; it won't return money already donated. What it should do is go beyond a single act of rebuffing to model a new process for evaluating money. Past and future donations could be judged on various criteria: Was the money legally and fairly made? Is the money owed to tax evasion or extreme legal tax avoidance? Is the museum effectively selling a modern papal indulgence for a sin that shouldn't be so easily pardoned? Does the donor have a duty of reparation to people they have exploited or harmed that gives those parties more of a right to the money?\n\nAnd the public should be brought into the process. Public-facing institutions enjoy the privilege of being untaxed, so citizens should be able to comment on and scrutinize prospective donations.\n\nThese questions will long be with us. For now, these museums have forced an essential conversation. For far too long, generosity has been allowed to serve as a wingman of injustice; giving back disguises merciless taking; making a difference becomes inseparable from making a killing -- sometimes literally.

(Mickey Welsh/Montgomery Advertiser/AP)\n\nAlabama's three abortion clinics insist they're not planning to close their doors, even as a new state law threatens to criminalize the procedures they provide.\n\n\"We've been through this fight over and over again,\" Dalton Johnson, owner of the Alabama's Women's Center, told me yesterday. \"Our main goal is to keep the women apprised that we will be challenging it in court.\"\n\nAlabama's Women's Center in Huntsville -- whose two doctors provide about 2,000 abortions every year -- is one of just three abortion clinics left in a state where there were more than 20 back in the 1990s. Now the abortions they provide would become almost entirely illegal under a sweeping restriction signed yesterday by Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R), who said in a statement that the legislation \"stands as a powerful testament to Alabamians' deeply held belief that every life is precious and that every life is a sacred gift from God.\"\n\nThe measure, which is easily the most restrictive abortion law in the country, would make performing an abortion a criminal act -- including in cases of rape or incest. Doctors caught attempting to perform an abortion could face up to 10 years in prison and those who actually complete the procedure could receive a sentence as long as 99 years. The law does not penalize the woman receiving the abortion.\n\nThere are three exceptions in which it permits abortions: if the woman's life is at risk, if the fetus has a \"lethal anomaly\" or if the pregnancy is ectopic, in which a fertilized egg is implanted outside the uterus.\n\nFrom the advocacy and political arm of Planned Parenthood Southeast:\n\nThe Onion poked fun at the law's lack of exceptions for rape and incest:\n\nThe law doesn't go into effect for six months.

And it is likely to be successful, considering the Alabama law is more drastic than \"heartbeat\" restrictions courts have already blocked in several states.\n\nBut to antiabortion advocates, getting the law enacted in Alabama isn't really the point. Their strategy is to get the Supreme Court -- now tilted 5 to 4 in favor of conservatives -- to consider overturning its 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion by passing a slew of abortion restrictions that clearly violate that standard (here are some great Washington Post graphics showing where states have advanced abortion restrictions and protections).\n\nAntiabortion advocacy group Susan B. Anthony List:\n\nAlabama Women's Center is unique in two respects, Johnson told me. It's the state's only clinic with doctors who have hospital admitting privileges, and it's the only one that performs abortions up to the state's current legal limit of 20 weeks of pregnancy. The clinic performs between 400 and 500 second-trimester abortions every year.\n\nBecause of these factors, the clinic sees patients from across Alabama as well as the nearby states of Mississippi, Tennessee, Louisiana and the Florida Panhandle, Johnson said.\n\n\"We get patients coming from six and eight hours away all the time, on a regular basis,\" Johnson said.\n\nAlabama Women's Center is on the north end of the state. Reproductive Health Services is in Montgomery, in the center of the state, and West Alabama Women's Center in Tuscaloosa is to the west. When I called those two clinics, receptionists who answered the phone said they plan to stay open as long as possible.\n\n\"If the law goes into effect ... we're not criminals; we would not be able to stay open,\" said an employee at the West Alabama Women's Center, who referred me to the ACLU for further comment. \"But until it's all resolved, we will be here.\"\n\n\"We don't see any interruption in any kind of service whatsoever,\" said an employee of Reproductive Health Services.\n\nThere's a good possibility the Supreme Court will confront a state abortion restriction in its term that begins in October -- but the Alabama law probably isn't at the top of its list, my Post colleague Robert Barnes explains. The justices are much more likely to take a gradual approach on the issue, perhaps by considering Louisiana's abortion doctor requirements or Indiana's ban on sex, race or disability-selective abortions.\n\n\"The court in general -- and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. in particular -- prefers a step-by-step process when shifting the court's jurisprudence, rather than disposing of an iconic landmark ruling in one grand gesture,\" Robert writes. \"That would probably hold true especially for one as etched in the American public's consciousness as Roe.\"\n\nThere's a reason state legislators hadn't yet attempted criminalizing the provision of abortions, per The Post's Aaron Blake. Americans have historically supported modest increases in abortion restrictions but overwhelmingly oppose the kind of legislation Alabama passed.\n\nSome abortion foes appeared skeptical of Alabama's new law. Longtime televangelist Pat Robertson decried Alabama's new abortion ban as \"extreme,\" saying on his show yesterday that the state legislature has \"gone too far,\" my Post colleague Sarah Pulliam Bailey reports.\n\n\"They want to challenge Roe vs. Wade, but my humble view is I don't think that's the case I'd want to bring to the Supreme Court because I think this one will lose,\" Robertson told viewers of CBN's \"The 700 Club\" on Wednesday.\n\nSen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) appeared none too eager to discuss the law, via HuffPost's Igor Bobic:\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), via NBC News's Frank Thorp:\n\nThe new law drew heated denouncements from abortion rights advocates, Democrats and 2020 presidential contenders, some of whom seized the opportunity to ask for donations to Planned Parenthood.\n\nAHH: The Food and Drug Administration is set to approve a second gene treatment for infants with spinal muscular atrophy that will cost $1.5 million to $5 million - it will be the costliest drug on the planet.\n\nIt's only the second drug on the market for the rare disease after a gene treatment was first introduced in 2016, as our Post colleague Christopher Rowland reports. Biogen, the drugmaker behind the initial treatment, had already drawn criticism for the price tag of the drug Spinraza, which costs $750,000 for the first year and $375,000 for each subsequent year.\n\nBut the new drug is set to kick off a \"new era of debates over cost and value as gene therapies are developed for growing numbers of rare diseases\" and it has already set off a clash between the manufacturer of the new drug, Novartis, and Biogen. And the clash has already produced what independent communication experts describe as a coordinated effort featuring \"op-ed columns by former Cabinet secretaries warning about the safety of the Novartis therapy.\"\n\n\"The controversy is clouding the debate as parents, doctors, and insurance companies will soon be grappling with highly complex decisions over which drug to choose and how to pay for it,\" he adds. \"How the medical system handles these questions of safety, effectiveness and price will set a precedent for future battles. The FDA is poised to review more applications for gene therapies for inherited diseases such as hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\"\n\nOOF: North Carolina has filed a lawsuit against e-cigarette maker Juul Labs, alleging the company has been \"deceptively downplaying the potency and danger of the nicotine.\" The suit, filed by state Attorney General Joshua Stein, also accuses the company of using advertising tactics to target underage users, our Post colleague Deanna Paul reports.\n\n\"Addicting a new generation of teenagers is unacceptable, illegal, and that's why I'm taking action,\" Stein told The Post. \"This is about a company that is selling its product predominantly to [youth]. There has to be some limitation on the way they do business.\"\n\nE-cigarette use has been a focus of scrutiny at the federal level. The Food and Drug Administration in March rolled out a policy meant to combat youth vaping. But North Carolina's suit goes a step further than what the FDA has already called for. In addition to calling for a ban on sales of Juul and other such products to minors, North Carolina has requested that mint-flavored products and popular fruit flavors such as mango be taken off the market.\n\nThe state also wants the court to employ a marketing ban that would block the company from specific advertising via email or social media that targets minors, and also wants the court to stop Juul from advertising in certain spaces, such as near playgrounds or schools, where young consumers are targeted.\n\nA Juul spokesman said the company shares \"the Attorney General's concerns about youth vaping, which is why we have been cooperating with his office and why we have taken the most aggressive actions of anyone in the industry to combat youth usage.\"\n\nOOF: A federal judge has temporarily blocked a controversial policy for distributing scarce livers for transplant, a ruling that comes just one day after the new rule was implemented.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg had initially decided not to halt the rules, asking the government to voluntarily delay the policy until the Supreme Court could weigh in on a relevant case, our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports. When the Department of Health and Human Services moved ahead with the policy anyway, the judge stepped in.\n\n\"For years, transplant hospitals generally had first claim to organs donated in their areas. The new policy offers livers to the sickest patients as far as 500 nautical miles from the donor. It was approved after a lawsuit was filed in New York by patients who said they were waiting longer for livers than less-ill people in other parts of the country,\" Lenny writes. \"The plaintiffs -- which include transplant centers in Georgia, Michigan, Kansas, Missouri and elsewhere, as well as people on the waiting list for livers -- say the rules will leave patients in those places with about 20 percent fewer organs than the current policy, resulting in an increase in waiting-list deaths ... Supporters of the new policy maintain, however, that regional disparities have become too great.\"\n\n\"Given the gravity of the medical issues and risk of disruption in the transplant system and the concrete likelihood of harm to the plaintiffs and the public at large if the status quo is not maintained, the Court finds that the public interest is best served\" by keeping the old policy in place, Totenberg wrote in her decision.\n\n-- New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art announced it will stop accepting donations from the Sackler family that has been at the center of growing criticism for its role in the nation's opioid crisis.\n\nThe family connected to OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma has donated to museums around the world for decades. As members of the family face lawsuits from hundreds of cities and counties for allegedly fueling the opioid crisis with deceptive marketing practices, other major art institutions have announced they would stop taking gifts from the family, including the Tate galleries and National Portrait Gallery in London and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, as our Post colleague Peggy McGlone reports.\n\n\"The Met said that its decision came after a months-long review of its gift policies, which was prompted by the public outcry over the Sackler gifts,\" Peggy writes. \"The Sackler donations to the Met -- including the gift that funded the wing housing the museum's Temple of Dendur -- date back half a century.

Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), and Tom Carper (D-Del.) have introduced the latest legislative effort to protect patients from unexpected medical bills.\n\nThe bipartisan STOP Surprise Medical Bills Act is meant to protect patients who get emergency care at an out-of-network facility or by an out-of-network provider, pateints who receive elective services at an in-network facility by out-of-network providers and patients who need additional services at an out-of-network facility if they need medical transport from such a facility. Under the bill, patients will only be responsible for their in-network cost-sharing.\n\n\"Patients should be the reason for the care, not an excuse for the bill,\" Cassidy said in a statement. \"This is a bipartisan solution ensuring patients are protected and don't receive surprise bills that are uncapped by anything but a sense of shame.\"\n\n-- In an effort to prevent wasted spending on health services that may result from misdiagnoses, Walmart has started recommending its workers use high-quality imaging centers for CT scans and MRIs.\n\nThe company is the largest private employer in the nation, and its health plan covers 1.1 million employees and dependents in the United States, Kaiser Health News's Phil Galewitz reports, adding that it also seems to be the first such major employer to direct its workers toward a specific service, in this case an imaging provider, because of accuracy rather than because of price.\n\n\"Walmart employees are not required to use those 800 centers, but if they don't use one that is available near them, they will have to pay additional cost sharing,\" Phil writes. \"Company officials advise workers that they could have more accurate results if they opt for the specified centers.\"\n\nThe shift first started after the company noticed a trend in workers who had misdiagnosed health conditions after going to certain specialized hospitals, which turned out to be a result of high error rates in their diagnostic imaging.\n\nLisa Woods, the senior director of benefits design at the Walmart pointed to a long-term benefit, even if the new effort is not specifically about saving money. \"It's been demonstrated time and time again that high quality ends up being more economical in the long run because inappropriate care is avoided, and patients do better,\" she said.\n\nWhat the Alabama governor has said about abortions so far:\n\nWhat Alabama's abortion legislation could mean for the rest of the country:", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/19b7dbd5b770587902190f0b9ad39151-3000-1940-70-8-5DX3EEDWYYI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4787615", "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 295704480}, {"uri": "1136990783", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-15", "time": "20:52:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-15T20:52:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8156862854957581, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/citing-opioid-ties-the-met-says-it-will-no-longer-accept-gifts-from-the-sackler-family/2019/05/15/e66ac2d8-7742-11e9-b7ae-390de4259661_story.html", "title": "Citing opioid ties, the Met says it will no longer accept gifts from the Sackler family", "body": "The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which decided to no longer accept Sackler donations after a months-long review of its gift policies. (Seth Wenig/AP) By Peggy McGlone Peggy McGlone Reporter covering the arts in the Washington region May 15 at 4:38 PM\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art announced Wednesday that it will no longer accept donations from the Sackler family of philanthropists who built their fortune from the development and sale of opioids.\n\nThe Met's decision comes amid mounting criticism of the Sacklers' role in the opioid crisis. Hundreds of cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits claiming that eight Sackler family members were involved in deceptive marketing practices of the family-owned pharmaceutical company, Purdue Pharma, and its blockbuster painkiller drug, OxyContin.\n\nThree other art institutions -- the Tate galleries and National Portrait Gallery in London and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York -- previously announced that they would not accept gifts from the family.\n\nFor decades, the Sacklers have supported high-profile cultural and educational institutions around the world -- from the Met to Harvard University to the Louvre. But artists and social media activists have criticized those relationships and called on the institutions to return the Sackler gifts and remove the name from their walls. In response to protests, the Sackler Trust, one of the family's philanthropic arms, announced in March that it was suspending donations.\n\n[The Sacklers have donated millions to museums, but the opioid crisis is threatening its legacy]\n\nThe Met's decision affects the branches of the family related to Purdue Pharma. In 1952, Sackler brothers Arthur, Mortimer and Raymond bought a small pharmaceutical company, and in 1987, Mortimer and Raymond bought out Arthur's share after his death. Purdue Pharma was established in 1991.\n\nThe Smithsonian's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution has drawn a similar distinction regarding the branches of the family and the source of their wealth. The Smithsonian's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery opened in 1987, months after its benefactor died and years before OxyContin came on the market. Arthur Sackler donated 1,000 objects and $4 million to the museum, and the Smithsonian is contractually bound to keep the family name on the Asian art museum, according to a spokeswoman, who added that future donations are not in the works.\n\n\"We have no plans to approach any member of the Sackler family for a donation,\" spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas said Wednesday, repeating the response from March, when the Guggenheim made its announcement.\n\n['Shame on Sackler': Anti-opioid activists call out late Smithsonian donor at his namesake museum]\n\nArthur's widow and Smithsonian donor, Jillian Sackler, has repeatedly said her husband had no role in the opioid crisis. \"It is a gross injustice to blame [Arthur],\" she said in a statement earlier this year. \"Not a penny of his philanthropy derived from the sale of OxyContin, and it is a disservice to the institutions he founded to suggest otherwise.\"\n\nThe Met said that its decision came after a months-long review of its gift policies, which was prompted by the public outcry over the Sackler gifts. The decision was first reported in the New York Times.\n\n\"Private philanthropy literally built The Metropolitan Museum of Art,\" Met president and chief executive Daniel Weiss said in a statement. \"What distinguishes our Museum from its global peers, such as the Prado, the Hermitage, and the Louvre, is the fact that we did not begin with a royal or imperial collection. Every object and much of the building itself came from individuals driven by a love for art and the spirit of philanthropy.\n\n\"For this reason, it is our responsibility to ensure that the public is aware of the diligence that we take to generate philanthropic support. Our donors deserve this, and the public should expect it.\"\n\nThe Sackler donations to the Met -- including the gift that funded the wing housing the museum's Temple of Dendur -- date back half a century.

Guggenheim Museum in New York, to distance themselves from the family behind Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. On Wednesday, the American Museum of Natural History said that it, too, had ceased taking Sackler donations.\n\nThe moves reflect the growing outrage over the role the Sacklers may have played in the opioid crisis, as well as an energized activist movement that is starting to force museums to reckon with where some of their money comes from.\n\n\"The museum takes a position of gratitude and respect to those who support us, but on occasion, we feel it's necessary to step away from gifts that are not in the public interest, or in our institution's interest,\" said Daniel H. Weiss, the president of the Met. \"That is what we're doing here.\"\n\nThe Met's relationship with the Sacklers goes back decades, and one of its biggest attractions, the Temple of Dendur, sits in the glass-enclosed Sackler Wing. Mr. Weiss said the museum had no plans to remove the name, as some protesters have demanded.\n\nBut its decision to stop accepting future gifts from Sacklers connected to Purdue Pharma, or their foundations, could spur other cultural institutions to follow suit. The family has given tens of millions of dollars and put its name in or on museums, universities and medical schools in the United States, England and Israel.\n\nIn the New York area alone, in addition to the Met, the Guggenheim and the Natural History museum, the Metropolitan Opera and the Dia Art Foundation are among the institutions that have received substantial gifts from the Sacklers.\n\nIn a statement, the Sackler family members with ties to Purdue Pharma said that \"while the allegations against our family are false and unfair, we understand that accepting gifts at this time would put the Met in a difficult position.\"\n\n\"We respect the Met and that is the last thing we would want to do,\" the statement said. \"Our goal has always been to support the valuable work of such outstanding organizations, and we remain committed to doing so.\"\n\nThe move by the Met comes as the Whitney Museum also finds itself caught in the politics of the era, facing growing calls from artists, protesters and even some museum staff members to remove one of its vice chairmen, Warren B. Kanders, from its board. Mr. Kanders is the chief executive of Safariland Group, which sells equipment to law enforcement agencies and militaries, including tear gas, which the art publication Hyperallergic said was used against migrants at the Mexican border.\n\nDozens of artists connected to the Whitney Biennial, a prestigious contemporary art exhibition that begins on Friday, signed an open letter calling for his resignation. And a group called Forensic Architecture, in partnership with Praxis Films, has made its Biennial exhibition a direct challenge to Mr. Kanders: It will show a 10-minute film that documents instances where Safariland's Triple-Chaser tear gas grenades have been deployed.\n\nMr. Kanders has rebuffed the demands for him to step down, saying that Safariland's products, which also include riot gear and bomb disposal robots, protect law enforcement officers and let them defuse dangerous situations without loss of life. He said he had no role in how the company's products were ultimately deployed.\n\nThe increased scrutiny on donors is forcing museums to navigate moral dilemmas and a political climate where a protest can go viral in a matter of hours. At the same time, they must mollify the wealthy benefactors who help keep the lights on and would rather not see their donations open them up to public examination.\n\nThere is also the difficult question of where to draw a line. What sort of behavior is inexcusable?\n\n\"We are not a partisan organization, we are not a political organization, so we don't have a litmus test for whom we take gifts from based on policies or politics,\" Mr. Weiss said. \"If there are people who want to support us, for the most part we are delighted.\"\n\n\"We would only not accept gifts from people if it in some way challenges or is counter to the core mission of the institution, in exceptional cases,\" he added. \"The OxyContin crisis in this country is a legitimate and full-blown crisis.\"\n\nThree brothers, Arthur, Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, bought a small company called Purdue Frederick in 1952 and transformed it into the pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma. In 1996, Purdue put the opioid painkiller OxyContin on the market, fundamentally altering the company's fortunes.\n\nThe family's role in the marketing of OxyContin, and in the opioid crisis, has come under increased scrutiny in recent years. Documents submitted this year as part of litigation by the attorney general of Massachusetts allege that members of the Sackler family directed the company's efforts to mislead the public about the dangers of the highly addictive drug. The company has denied the allegations and said it \"neither created nor caused the opioid epidemic.\"\n\nArthur Sackler died before OxyContin's creation and his side of the family, which has supported institutions including the Smithsonian and the Brooklyn Museum, has not played a role in Purdue Pharma for years. One of his children, Elizabeth A. Sackler, has called the company's role in the opioid epidemic \"morally abhorrent.\"\n\nMr. Weiss, who described the Met's decision as a \"suspension,\" said the museum would refuse only gifts from members of the Sackler family closely connected to Purdue. Those gifts have exceeded $200,000 over the last two decades, a small amount for a museum with a $320 million annual budget, but the symbolism was unmistakable.\n\nThe family's contributions to the Met go back some 50 years. A 1978 news release announcing the official dedication of the Sackler Wing said it cost $9.5 million to build -- about $36 million in today's dollars -- and called the Sacklers \"major donors\" to the project. At the dedication reception, which was jointly hosted by the Met and the three brothers, the Martha Graham Dance Company performed a new work at the Temple of Dendur, which was a gift from Egypt to the United States.\n\nMr. Weiss said that the museum would not take the more drastic step of taking the family's name off the wing, saying that it was not in a position to make permanent changes while litigation against the family was ongoing and information still coming to light.\n\nThe Met also said that its board had voted to codify how the museum accepts named gifts, formalizing a longstanding practice of circulating those proposals through a chain of departments. The decision on the Sacklers, Mr. Weiss said, was made by the Met leadership in consultation with the board.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_a_harris@nytimes.com", "name": "Elizabeth A.

Now They Say It Was a Fraud.", "body": "BECKLEY, W.Va. -- On a spring day in 2017, Stephanie Frame sat down in her hilltop home deep in the mountain hollows to record a video.\n\nShe began with the litany of local decline: the vanishing jobs in the coal mines, the shuttering stores, the school that closed down. During one stretch of unemployment for her coal miner husband, the two had resorted to selling ramps, ginseng and yellowroot that they had dug up in the forest.\n\nBut this video, aimed at her neighbors, was an announcement: Redemption was here. A nonprofit called Mined Minds, promising to teach West Virginians how to write computer code and then get them good-paying jobs, was looking for recruits.\n\n\"I wholeheartedly believe, and will always believe,\" Ms. Frame said to the camera, \"that God has sent Mined Minds to us to save us from what could have been a very bleak future.\"\n\nShe had every reason to believe. Joe Manchin III, her Democratic senator, had invited the group to come into the state. The National Guard hired it to teach at its military-style academy. County commissioners arranged space rent free. National news outlets gave glowing coverage.\n\nMany West Virginians like Ms. Frame signed up for Mined Minds, quitting their jobs or dropping out of school for the prized prospect of a stable and lucrative career. But the revival never came.\n\nAlmost none of those who signed up for Mined Minds are working in programming now. They described Mined Minds as an erratic operation, where guarantees suddenly evaporated and firings seemed inevitable, leaving people to start over again at the bottom rungs of the wage jobs they had left behind.\n\nOver two dozen former students in West Virginia are pursuing a lawsuit, arguing that Mined Minds was a fraud. Out of the 10 or so people who made it to the final weeks of Ms. Frame's class in Beckley, only one formally graduated. He is now delivering takeout.\n\n\"It was a too-good-to-be-true kind of deal,\" said Billyjack Buzzard, 33, who attended another class and was the only former West Virginia coal miner to finish classes and get a job with the program. He was fired after 14 months and went back underground. \"Just false hope.\"\n\nMined Minds came into Appalachia espousing a certain dogma, fostered in the world of start-ups and TED Talks, and carried with missionary zeal into places in dire need of economic salvation. The group was premised on the notion, as one grant proposal read, that \"anyone can have a successful career in the technology industry,\" and that if enough people did, the whole area would be transformed.\n\nAmanda Laucher, one of the founders of Mined Minds, spoke at a tech conference in 2017 of the group's ambitions, which were swiftly expanding. \"Yeah, we helped a town, we actually made some small impact,\" she said of Mined Minds' early efforts. \"But can we scale it and actually diversify the economy of an entire region?\"\n\nThis would be an audacious goal even in the best of circumstances. But Mined Mines was operating with a limited amount of personal cash and public funding, and was mostly staffed by people who had spent little time in tech.\n\nMs. Laucher now acknowledges that while she is still committed to the group's mission, the work has not been easy. \"Progress is difficult,\" she said in an email, \"with the current atmosphere in Appalachia which is deeply interested in maintaining a 'culture.'\"\n\nShe blamed the opioid epidemic and \"the poverty culture\" of the region, mentioning \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" the best-selling memoir by J.D. Vance, who, like Ms. Laucher, went from working-class Rust Belt roots to success in the tech sector.\n\nShe added: \"There are generations of hard work ahead. We'll be only a tiny force working toward change in the area I grew up.\"\n\nNone of this -- neither the experience itself nor Ms. Laucher's thoughts about its difficulties -- strikes some former students as surprising. This is, they say, how things tend to go in Appalachia.\n\n\"I get angry at people who go to other places and say, 'My culture is better than theirs and I am going to change it,'\" said Katie Bolyard, 25, a college graduate who skipped her honeymoon to take a class.\n\nShe doesn't know the motives of the people at Mined Minds, she said, whether they had bad intentions or were just \"incredibly sloppy\" with good ones. But intentions only matter so much. \"It's not your life you're messing with.\"\n\n'They All Find a Job'\n\nBefore the founding of Mined Minds, Ms. Laucher and her husband, Jonathan Graham, were living in Chicago working as successful tech consultants. But in 2015, she learned that her younger brother, Marvin, had been laid off from a mine back in the coalfields of southwest Pennsylvania where she grew up.\n\nHe was stuck in the Appalachian dilemma: technologically savvy, as modern miners have to be, but stuck with few options. So Mr. Graham and Ms. Laucher quit their jobs and moved to Pennsylvania.\n\nThe model for Mined Mines, at least initially, was this: a free 16-week coding boot camp, followed by paid \"apprenticeships\" with the program's for-profit arm, a software consultancy. Apprentices worked full-time on projects for company clients, but were also called upon to teach in the classes they had graduated from months earlier. After working for a few months, apprentices would either go on to salaried jobs at the Mined Minds company, or to a big tech firm such as Oracle.\n\n\"Every single one of them\" finds work, Ms. Laucher said of the boot camp graduates, in a 2017 interview. \"They all find a job.\"\n\nA guarantee like that was barely short of miraculous. Within two years, Mined Minds was one of the primary beneficiaries of a $1.5 million grant from the Appalachian Regional Commission. In August 2016, Mr. Manchin, who encouraged the couple to expand from Pennsylvania, said that Mr. Graham and Ms. Laucher \"embody the spirit of West Virginia.\"\n\nIn the spring of 2017, Tori Frame, Stephanie Frame's daughter, was making $10 an hour as an assistant manager at a Family Dollar store when she learned about Mined Minds.\n\n\"I didn't want to be stuck in Gauley Bridge, W.Va., my whole life working at Family Dollar,\" said Tori, 23. \"I wanted something different.\"\n\nOthers viewed Mined Minds the same way. Andrew Farley figured he could quickly make the pay scale in coding that he made working for the railroad, but without having to leave his hometown; Chris Phelps, who washed dishes at a Cracker Barrel, thought a tech career was a way to get out of town.\n\nTy Cook, 29, a bank teller, saw something more, \"something that would make me a worthwhile member of society.\"\n\nAnd there was an irresistible promise: They would be paid to take the class. Some were told this in an email by a state jobs counselor, others said they were told by Ms. Laucher. The counselor said in an email they would receive $10 an hour, with the potential for more as apprentices or when they were hired. A number of people, including Tori, quit their jobs. (Ms. Laucher has denied making any such promise.)\n\nIn late June 2017, a big crowd gathered in a classroom at a small college campus in Beckley. They met Marvin Laucher, Ms. Laucher's brother, the former coal miner, now their main instructor. They also learned that they were not going to be paid. Some dropped out the first week.\n\nBut Tori and her mother, Stephanie, 45, stayed. Every weekday morning, Tori would wake up early, her mother would feed the chickens and together they would head down the serpentine mountain road to Beckley. Nights and weekends they spent in the glow of their laptops -- bought from a website on credit -- learning the rudiments of Ruby, the programming language.\n\nThere was never much of a syllabus; students would be given an assignment and spend the next few days trying to figure it out, mostly by themselves. The usual answer to questions, multiple students said, was \"Google it.\" A few quietly wondered how much their teachers really knew.\n\nUnease began to settle in among some of the students. They began to learn from their teaching assistants, graduates of a recent Mined Minds class, that the good stable jobs promised by the group were not nearly as stable as they appeared.\n\nFirings and resignations were routine among the staff. One of the Beckley teaching assistants, a 33-year-old named Maxx Turner, had already been fired, then rehired after several fruitless months of searching for programming work, he said. Some began to suspect that the program couldn't afford the job guarantee it was advertising.\n\nMoney woes did not make sense, given what they saw of the founders' lifestyle: the travels worldwide, the views from an office in Chicago's Trump Tower, the ever-replenishing tequila bottles at the West Virginia headquarters, the boozy house parties in Pennsylvania.\n\nSeveral former Mined Minds staff members described company gatherings the same way: Their bosses ordering seemingly endless shots, hectoring the more timid drinkers. \"I thought by going out drinking with them I'd put myself in a better position,\" said Michael Moore, 35, the other teaching assistant in Beckley, who dropped out of community college to take the program.\n\nThe promised 16-week class went on 17 weeks. Then 18, then 19. As the class continued, many students began to run out of money. Out of the more than two dozen students who began, about 10 were left by late October, some playing computer games in class to pass the time, just waiting for the final project before graduation.\n\nA Fateful Trip\n\nEarly on, Ms. Laucher had suggested the project would be something for the community, maybe a gaming app addressing the opioid epidemic. Then the project was finally announced: the design of a website for a pet bed-and-breakfast that Ms. Laucher's mother was opening in Pennsylvania.\n\nBut Stephanie Frame was still a believer. When word spread of a trip by the Mined Minds leadership to a tech conference in Lithuania in November, she saw an opportunity. She had never been out of the country, but this was a way to lock in a job, for her and for her daughter. Her husband agreed to spend $1,000 on the trip.\n\n\"If I could hang with them,\" she remembered thinking, \"be one of them, show them how dedicated I am, how much I supported them, then we've got it.\"\n\nWhile Stephanie and others were in Lithuania, the rest of the class was debating whether to stick it out to graduation. A news station in Pennsylvania had reported on problems with the Mined Minds program there, including that nearly all the graduates of one class had been fired right after being hired as apprentices. The state of Pennsylvania ordered Mined Minds to cease operations for not having a license to run a school.\n\nOn a morning in late November, in the first class after the Lithuania conference, the students in Beckley arrived to a shocking development. Two people who had gone on the trip -- Stephanie Frame and Mr. Moore, their teaching assistant -- had been kicked out of the program.\n\nIn a video conference, Ms. Laucher told the class that Stephanie had been dismissed because of \"extreme sexual harassment, lots of drunkenness, basically behaving in a way that we wouldn't condone at Mined Minds.\"\n\nStephanie was stunned. She thought the trip had been successful. She had gotten very drunk, she said, but no one on the trip had mentioned anything like \"extreme sexual harassment.\" Mr. Moore said he had seen nothing like the harassment Ms. Laucher described, and that in any case, everyone had been drunk.\n\nHe would later be told that he was being dismissed for being belligerent one night of the trip, and also of having a drug problem -- a charge, he said, easily refuted by years of clean drug tests -- including one for Mined Minds.\n\nAs Ms. Laucher shared the news, other students were angry, and suspicious.\n\n\"Even in the moment I'm hearing this I'm thinking, 'O.K., this isn't adding up,'\" Mr. Phelps said.\n\nMs. Bolyard wondered whether Mined Minds simply couldn't afford the apprenticeships. \"They were just making excuses to get rid of people,\" she said.\n\nTori's parents told her to just finish the class, but she couldn't. She sent a formal resignation letter, citing broken promises and a \"party culture\" that turned her off. Nearly all of the other students, infuriated by the whole thing, followed.\n\n'It Repeats Itself'\n\nMined Minds has continued operating, holding new classes in Logan, another hard-luck coal town in West Virginia.\n\nIn mid-April of this year, Ms. Laucher reprimanded five employees for not making enough networking connections on LinkedIn, for neglecting to read a book she had assigned, \"The Start-Up of You,\" and for not submitting their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to her for help. The next day, all five were fired. The staff of the program in West Virginia, two of those former employees said, now consists of Ms. Laucher's brother and sister.\n\nAnd several weeks ago, Ms. Laucher announced on social media that she had been accepted to law school in Chicago.\n\nAsked if this was the end of Mined Minds, Ms. Laucher wrote: \"Absolutely not. Still going.\"\n\nSince the class in Beckley ended, Stephanie Frame has mostly stayed home.\n\nAs she recounted her experience with Mined Minds in her living room, her husband, Roger, just off work, sat down and listened. It's always the same here, he finally said.\n\n\"They're coming here promising stuff that they don't deliver,\" said Mr. Frame, his hands and face still gray with coal dust. \"People do that all the time. They've always done it to Appalachians.\"\n\nHe recalled the pittance his great-grandparents sold their mineral rights for, and what they got from it: the coal company tearing down mountains and building roads wherever it wanted. Timber, coal, oil and gas, \"it repeats itself,\" he said. \"It's like a never-ending cycle.\"\n\nMembers of the Beckley class still keep in touch on a private chat group they call \"Disenfranchised Appalachians.\" Nearly everyone they had worked alongside has quit or been fired, though some said they had learned a lot from their work at Mined Minds. One, usually described as the program's clear success, found a programming job in South Carolina.\n\nStephanie's daughter Tori, who had begun dating Ty Cook from the class, went back to the Family Dollar, starting over as a cashier. Over the next year, she worked her way up to become manager, a promotion that, Ms. Laucher said in a recent deposition for the lawsuit, was evidence of \"the logic and problem solving skills that came with Mined Minds training.\"\n\nA couple of months ago, however, Tori found a job at a call center in Columbus, Ohio. In late February, she and Mr. Cook packed their belongings in a trailer and left West Virginia.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "campbell_robertson@nytimes.com", "name": "Campbell Robertson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/01/us/00minerscode-03/00minerscode-02-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4790943", "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 295347780}, {"uri": "1132786755", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-10", "time": "11:55:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-10T11:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6313725709915161, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2019/05/10/the-health-202-senators-want-surprise-medical-bills-to-be-negotiated-like-baseball-salaries/5cd462e51ad2e506550b2fdf/", "title": "Analysis | The Health 202: Senators want surprise medical bills to be negotiated like baseball salaries", "body": "President Trump speaks about surprise medical bills. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nPresident Trump struck a conciliatory tone yesterday as he advocated protecting consumers from surprise medical bills. But differences between the White House and members of Congress over precisely how to do that are already emerging.\n\nThe difference is over whether to use a process known as \"baseball-style arbitration\" to settle billing disputes between insurers and health providers. Senators working on surprise-billing legislation said arbitration is a proven, effective approach, even as White House officials threw cold water on the idea.\n\nLet's back up for a minute. In an address at the White House (which The Health 202 previewed here), the president laid out broad areas of agreement regarding the bills incurred by many Americans when, through no fault of their own, they receive care at an emergency room outside their health plan's network or are unexpectedly seen by an out-of-network doctor even though they're at an in-network hospital.\n\nPoliticians and industry folks agree that patients shouldn't be forced to pay these extra bills, which can be thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. Trump said Congress should work quickly to stop the practice, which he said is bankrupting patients by charging them for \"unexpected health-care costs that are absolutely out of control.\"\n\n\"No family should be blindsided by outrageous medical bills,\" the president said.\n\nSeveral victims of surprise medical billing were standing next to Trump and even allowed to make some of their own remarks. Health reporters have told many of their stories. Reuters reporter Chad Terhune:\n\nStanding next to Trump were two senators working on legislation to protect patients from surprise medical bills. Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), along with Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), are leading a bipartisan effort to craft legislation laying out exactly how insurers and providers can reach agreement on out-of-network bills without involving patients.\n\nThe group has yet to unveil legislation -- they've promised it will be ready in the next few weeks -- but both Cassidy and Hassan hinted strongly they prefer baseball-style arbitration. In this process, which Hassan has proposed separately in previous legislation, a third party collects two figures -- what the doctor is charging and what the insurer is agreeing to pay -- and decides which figure is fairest.\n\nThe process is similar to the way salaries for Major League Baseball players are decided. The player and the team are permitted to name the salary they feel is most appropriate, and an independent arbiter picks one. Both sides are incentivized to offer realistic salaries because they want the figure they've cited to win out.\n\nThe state of New York, which passed arbitration legislation in 2015, has been successful in reducing out-of-network emergency room billing. The percent of out-of-network emergency department services that were billed decreased from 20 percent in 2013 to 6 percent after the law was implemented, according to Yale University researchers.\n\n\"I'm a big believer that the states experiment and we learn from their experiment,\" Cassidy said. \"Arbitration has worked in New York.\"\n\nBut in a news briefing earlier in the day, White House officials said they don't favor arbitration, calling it an \"unnecessary distraction.\"\n\n\"We do not have a lot of enthusiasm for arbitration,\" a senior administration official told reporters. \"We believe that would be disruptive. And we believe ... at the end of the day, a lot of potential abuses disguised in a different form would nevertheless still be inflicted against patients and Americans.\"\n\nPolitico's Rachel Roubein:\n\nKaran Chhabra, a surgical resident at Brigham and Women's Hospital:\n\nInsurers were pleased by that position, as they have argued arbitration leads to unnecessarily high payments to doctors. \"Arbitration gives equal weight to inflated doctors' bills .\u2009.\u2009. [and] negotiated rates,\" Adam Beck, vice president for policy of America's Health Insurance Plans, told my Washington Post colleague Amy Goldstein.\n\nBut doctors groups also pointed to New York's example, saying the federal government should try what has worked for states. \"It's encouraging that the White House agrees with patients and physicians throughout the country who are urging Congress to take action,\" said Sherif Zaafran, chairman of Physicians for Fair Coverage. \"The best way to ensure no patient receives a surprise bill is for Congress to pass legislation with a dispute resolution process, which has already been implemented in nine states, including years of success in New York.\"\n\nChip Kahn, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, praised the administration's focus on the issue. \"We think that patients should be held harmless for these out-of-network charges to their expected cost-sharing, so the White House's interest focuses a light on an issue that Congress should address,\" he said.\n\nDespite his bipartisan tone, Trump couldn't resist promising yet again that Republicans would come up with another sweeping health-care bill, presumably to replace the Affordable Care Act Act. Per the Hill's Peter Sullivan:\n\nAHH: Gilead Sciences, the drugmaker behind the highly effective once-a-day HIV prevention medication, announced it would donate enough pills to cover as many as 200,000 people a year for up to 11 years. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the donation was \"a result of discussions between the Trump Administration and Gilead Sciences.\"\n\nThe company will donate up to 2.4 million bottles of the drug Truvada to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the agency will distribute the medication to people who are uninsured and at a high risk of contracting HIV, our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports.\n\nGilead's donation is part of the president's pledge to stop the spread of HIV in the country by 90 percent by 2030. \"The government strategy to curb the spread of HIV focuses on the small number of places where the virus is concentrated: the District of Columbia; Puerto Rico; 48 hot-spot counties across the country and in the rural parts of seven Southern states,\" Lenny writes. \"In 2017, the South had about 20,000 new HIV diagnoses, more than the rest of the country combined.\"\n\nA one year supply of the drug, known as PrEP, costs more than $20,000. \"The majority of Americans who are at risk and who could protect themselves with PrEP are still not receiving the medication,\" Azar said in a statement. \"This agreement will help close that gap substantially.\"\n\nThe bill, which is still expected to be passed by the conservative majority, is one of many measures introduced around the country making abortion illegal within the first few weeks of pregnancy. \"Alabama Rep. Terri Collins (R), who sponsored the bill, said its purpose is to spark litigation that would force the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that guarantees a woman's right to abortion,\" our Post colleagues Emily Wax-Thibodeaux and Ariana Eunjung Cha report.\n\nOUCH: The Kentucky teenager who sued a local health department after he was banned from school for not having the chickenpox vaccine contracted chickenpox last month.\n\nHis father believes that's a good thing, our Post colleague Michael Brice-Saddler reports. Chris Wiest, an attorney for the family, said the newfound immunity 18-year-old Jerome Kunkel has after contracting the disease is proof there was no need for a ban.\n\nIn March, the Northern Kentucky Health Department barred students who did not have proof they had received the chickenpox vaccine or were immune. Kunkel's family is against the vaccination because of religious beliefs, and sued the health department to end the ban.\n\n\"This is a stupid ban that's never going to work, \" the family's attorney said. \"We are not at all surprised. This is exactly what we told the court would happen. Over half my clients contracted chickenpox and had no complications, and now they have a lifetime immunity.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Northern Kentucky Health Department criticized Wiest's suggestion that people should contract the disease to become immune.\n\n\"While the tactic Wiest suggests may provide an individual with future immunity from chickenpox, this infected person can easily spread the virus to other, unsuspecting people, including those particularly vulnerable to this potentially life-threatening infection,\" the statement read. \"Encouraging the spread of an acute infectious disease in a community demonstrates a callous disregard for the health and safety of friends, family, neighbors, and unsuspecting members of the general public.\"\n\n-- Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Democratic presidential contender Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) have introduced a bill to address high maternal mortality rates, specifically pointing to the particularly high death rates for black women.\n\nThe Healthy MOMMIES Act looks to expand Medicaid to make sure pregnant women are covered across the pregnancy, labor and postpartum periods, increasing coverage from 60 to 365 days after giving birth. The bill ensures coverage beyond services only related to pregnancy.\n\nThe bill, introduced days before Mother's Day, also comes as a recent report from the CDC found that in the United States, there are 40 pregnancy-related deaths among black women for every 100,000 births. Black women are three times as likely as white women to die of pregnancy-related condition, the report found.\n\n\"The lived experiences of Black women demonstrate how racism and trauma directly impact the health and wellbeing of marginalized communities for generations,\" Pressley said in a statement. \"Maternal justice is about ensuring that every mom-to-be is listened to and treated with dignity and respect during and after childbirth. The Healthy MOMMIES Act would do just that by promoting a community-based, holistic approach to maternal care that recognizes current disparities in healthcare and critical environmental factors impacting communities.\"\n\n-- Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) introduced a bill meant to address skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs for consumers and increase transparency about the costs of medications they pick up at the pharmacy.\n\nThe Prescription Drug Rebate Reform Act of 2019 will mandate that coinsurance for patients be based on a percentage of net price, which is the price of a drug after rebates, discounts and fees. Patients currently pay coinsurance based on the drug's list price, which does not include those discounts. \"Drug prices -- and out of pocket expenses paid by consumers -- seem to continually be on the rise,\" Braun said in a statement.\n\n\"What is not talked about enough, however, is the inherent conflict of interest arising from negotiated rebates that affect the actual cost of drugs, which are paid by drug makers to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) in exchange for preferred status on insurers' health plan formularies ... These rebates are often hidden from consumers, contribute to high list prices for prescription drugs, and leave consumers with all, or a big part of the tab.\"\n\n-- There are signs the deadly opioid crisis is starting to slow in Maryland.\n\nAccording to preliminary data released from a state organization in Maryland, there were 2,114 opioid-related deaths last year in the state, which is an increase of 5.2 percent from the year prior. While still an uptick, it's the slowest single-year increase since 2011, according to the data released by Maryland's Opioid Operational Command Center in a first-of-its-kind report, our Post colleague Erin Cox reports.\n\nThe rise in annual fentanyl deaths was not as sharp last year as it was before, with a 17.1 percent increase in 2018 compared with a 42.5 percent jump the year before that. Still, more people were killed by fentanyl and fentanyl mixed with cocaine, while deaths from heroin and prescription painkillers declined last year, Erin reports.\n\nSteven R. Schuh, executive director of the state organization that tracks the government's response to the opioid crisis, said: \"We are encouraged that the epidemic is starting to plateau.\"\n\n-- A group of diabetes advocates traveled from Minnesota to Canada over the weekend in part to make a point about the cost of insulin.\n\n\"Can you explain to me why I would stay in the U.S. and continue to be price-gouged for $320 a vial when I can drive five hours and get it for $30?\" one of the participants in the mission told Stat's Nicholas Florko. \"The only difference between us and Canada is politicians here in America have not created any solutions to lower the price of insulin. ... The federal government, they talk about all these laws, but they can't get them passed.\"\n\nThat participant, Quinn Nystrom, has diabetes and said she spends more than $7,000 in out-of-pocket expenses a year. Others on the trip, such as Nicole Smith-Holt, whose son Alec died after rationing his insulin, made the trip as a symbolic effort.\n\nAfter a five-hour car ride, the group walked into a pharmacy and came out with the medication they wanted -- many bought Novo Nordisks's NovoLog, labeled in Canada as NovoRapid, at $30, compared to the $289.36 list price in the United States, Nicholas writes.\n\nThe Fix's Amber Phillips on the standoff between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration and whether it could lead to impeachment proceedings:", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/4a5e209570161aab128904d6c2a80929-5472-3648-70-8-JBM5POTSUUI6THYGL7BO5AACPI.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4777981", "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 295185300}, {"uri": "1132326329", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-09", "time": "22:13:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-09T22:13:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/paloma/the-trailer/2019/05/09/the-trailer-trumpworld-s-plan-to-reelect-the-president/5cd2f3dba7a0a46cfe152c91/", "title": "Analysis | The Trailer: Trumpworld's plan to reelect the president", "body": "In this edition: The Trump battle plan, ad wars in North Carolina, and a new poll from the first primary state.\n\nEight Democratic candidates for president are polling at zero in New Hampshire, and this is The Trailer.\n\nThe president's Wednesday night rally in the Florida Panhandle ended without much of a theme. He took shots at Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke. He attacked China for its aggressive turn in trade negotiations, then shrugged that \"It'll work out.\" And he appeared to laugh when a crowd member yelled about shooting undocumented immigrants.\n\nWhat made less news but mattered much more for the president's reelection hopes was a pledge to redirect nearly half a billion more dollars toward hurricane recovery -- and a promise to rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base, damaged by last year's storms. That was exactly what the coalition working to reelect Trump wanted to hear: Every visit to a swing state, every offer of help from the government, could help them get reluctant voters excited about 2020. And Trump campaign representatives were working the rally, collecting data from attendees who might want to reelect the president.\n\nThe president's reelection campaign, which began on the day he was sworn in, is not built with the expectation of a landslide. Like Barack Obama's 2012 campaign, it's designed to grind out a win by identifying everyone who supports the president, getting them registered and active, and turning them out. The president won just 45.9 percent of the popular vote in 2016 but edged out wins in key states. The mission in 2020 is to do it again.\n\nAs Democrats debate what model can win in 2020 -- revving up their base? Convincing independents that Trump is an aberration? -- the Trump operation is sticking to what worked before. Trump allies believe they have a long head start on the Democrats, who only this year created an independent source for voter profiles, the Data Warehouse, modeled after the years-old Republican Data Trust.\n\nThe DNC is still recovering from the Obama-era mismanagement that ended with supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) accusing it of rigging the 2016 primary; the RNC, with the president's blessing on all of its small-donor pitches, has no such problems. As a candidate, Trump decried super PACs; as a president, he has blessed America First Action, a super PAC with plans to raise $300 million ahead of the election. The president himself had recently helped America First raise money; the president's supporters, Republicans say, do not care if he once attacked this sort of politics.\n\nSome prognosticators, looking at economic models, see a path to a Trump landslide. Trumpworld isn't that cocky; donors to America First Action are told that just 164 electoral votes are locked in for the president, while 13 states will see at least some kind of competition and spending. These are states -- Arizona, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania -- where the president got less than 52 percent of the vote in 2016. The AFA's goal is to spend $250 million on the last six states on that list, which have the most electoral votes.\n\nIn each state, the focus is entirely on hitting a turnout number. In Florida, for example, the starting Trumpworld assumption is that 10.5 million votes could be cast, which would represent record turnout in a fast-growing state. To be sure of a win, the president would need around 5.2 million to 5.3 million votes. At least 4.3 million Floridians, according to the campaign models, are already assured to come out for the president. The goal from there is straightforward: Find the 972,000-odd voters who would get the president to the win number.\n\n\"I believe that between the president holding rallies, Brad executing on his digital strategy, and Ronna and the DNC working on turnout, we can bridge that gap,\" said Brian O. Walsh, president of America First Policies. (Brad is Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale; Ronna is RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.)\n\nGetting those voters means persuading some holdouts, chiefly the ones who came out of 2016 disliking both Trump and Hillary Clinton. The sharpest tool for winning them over, Republicans say, is information about the president's lower-profile wins -- everything from anti-opioid legislation to projects such as rebuilding that Air Force base in the Panhandle.\n\nJust as many voters, though, might be found by converting nonvoters or infrequent voters into Trump supporters. Trumpworld, after a midterm that showed most suburban women could not be swayed to their side, was captivated by data that found the voters who dropped off the most from 2016 to 2018 were white men who lacked college degrees, a loyal section of the president's base.\n\nHundreds of thousands of voters who fit that profile, especially in states such as Florida, simply weren't registered. Tapping some of them had helped blow apart the Democrats' election models in 2016 and in some states in 2018 -- Democrats barely believed it possible to win Jacksonville's Duval County without winning the state. The new theory was that if the haphazard 2016 Trump campaign could activate some of these voters, a better-organized 2020 version could find them with months to spare.\n\nThe Democrats' busy presidential primary didn't affect these calculations, but its crowded nature both helps and hurts the Trump effort. Unlike in 2016, when Republicans inherited decades of messaging against Hillary Clinton, there is relatively little research yet on what attacks would work on the possible Democratic nominee.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden is seen as the candidate who would most credibly allow the president to run as a \"change agent,\" even from the Rose Garden; Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has touted internal polls that show him strong in the Midwest, is seen by Trumpworld as too far left to win, likely to alienate Democrats who are not comfortable with \"socialism,\" however defined.\n\nWith no obvious Democratic opponent, Trumpworld has been elevating Sanders and some of the left-wing House class. In 2016, famously, the president struggled to unite the kind of high-dollar Republican donors who'd backed other candidates in the primary or helped Mitt Romney compete with Obama. In 2019, the Trump allies working to win those donors were finding some of them rattled by the latest thing they'd heard from Sanders or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.); it was opening wallets faster than the president could get them to open on his own.\n\nThe campaign apparatus could take advantage of that, even if the president did not. In Florida, with the national media gathered to cover him, he did not take any swings at Sanders or the Democrats' left.\n\n\"Trump endorsed a super PAC supporting him -- and here's why that might not be a legal problem,\" by Michelle Ye Hee Lee\n\nCampaigns tend to be careful in how they describe their favored super PACs, as they are not allowed to coordinate with them. But a damaging story about a PAC that was diverting possible donations from the Trump campaign persuaded Trumpworld to clarify its favorite super PAC: America First Action.\n\n\"Wall Street Democrats Are Absolutely Freaking Out About Their 2020 Candidates,\" by Gabriel Debenedetti\n\nThe poll rise of Joe Biden has, perhaps temporarily, paused what was a running story among big Democratic donors -- panic about a more populist candidate seizing the nomination.\n\n\"As Warren and Trump team jockey on opioids, Democrats say president betrayed his base on a devastating addiction scourge,\" by Annie Linskey and Katie Zezima\n\nThe Trump campaign fully intends to tell voters that the president began solving the opioid crisis; Democrats don't plan to let him do it.\n\n\"Why Georgia's anti-abortion law is 'just the beginning,' \" by Greg Bluestein\n\nGeorgia's new law, which classifies abortion after six weeks of pregnancy as murder, goes further than any pre-Roe legislation.

Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) gave the International Association of Machinists a stemwinder about how the economy was failing them. As the congressman from eastern Ohio, as a candidate for president, he had seen this at the root: He had been pounding the Trump administration over policies that could not save a GM plant in Lordstown.\n\n\"How many times does this have to happen before we take over the economic and political system and make it work for us?\" Ryan asked.\n\nHours later, the president announced that he was going to save the Lordstown plant. Sort of. In a tweet later confirmed by GM, the president declared that the 6.2 million-square-foot plant might be taken over by Workhouse Group, a small Ohio company, thanks to his lobbying.\n\nRyan spent much of the day responding to what was initially seen as good news. In a video statement, Ryan called the deal \"bittersweet,\" assuming it went off at all. In a call with reporters, he was asked how, exactly, Democrats would campaign for replacing the president when the job market was so tight.\n\n\"Many of these people are underemployed,\" Ryan said. \"I'll give you a perfect example, in Trumbull County. We are losing 1,700 jobs, good-paying UAW jobs that have gone in the past two years. We have a TJX distribution center coming online, which will be a thousand jobs, but those jobs aren't going to pay as much. In the short term you're going to see job growth, but the issue is underemployment. ... I just think these old metrics, quite frankly, of unemployment rates and stock markets are way overblown today.\"\n\nThe No. 1 concern of the Trump reelection effort, the factor it can't control, is a slowdown in the economy. But if the economy grows at the current hot and steady pace, Democrats are stuck in the same position as Ryan -- arguing that the growth has not prevented decline outside big cities and suburbs, and that, anyway, the administration is taking credit for a trend it inherited.\n\n\"This is nine years into an economic expansion, seven of which happened under President Obama,\" said Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), who represents parts of Philadelphia. \"The average job growth per month isn't any better than the last couple of years of the Obama administration. So I'm glad that, even with all of Donald Trump's screw-ups, he has not screwed up this economic expansion.\"\n\nIn a memo obtained first by Politico, the Democratic National Committee has clarified the rules for cutting candidates out of its first two debates.\n\nAs previously announced, there will be two debates in prime time in June, on the 26th and 27th, in Miami. Each debate will feature up to 10 candidates; if more than 20 candidates qualify, the candidates with the lowest polling average (their best three polling results, divided by three, rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point) will be cut.\n\nAt the moment, three declared candidates for president have neither 65,000 donations (one way to make the debate) or any combination of polls putting them at 1 percent (the other method). They are: Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), and Miramar, Fla., Mayor Wayne Messam.\n\nNorth Carolina's 9th Congressional District. The Club for Growth's intervention in the nearby 3rd District didn't make much of a ripple, but its work here -- in a special election sparked by fraud allegations against a Republican campaign -- hits all the popular insurgent themes. In a new spot, the group hits Leigh Brown, a Realtor and first-time candidate. \"Brown attacked in the 2016 campaign. She wrote: Donald Trump, you're wrong.\"\n\nState Sen. Dan Bishop's own campaign has positioned him as the \"battle-tested conservative\" whose first priority in Washington will be to \"build President Trump's wall\"; his own ad, in rotation now, portrays Democrat Dan McCready as one of many \"clowns\" he's ready to fight, next to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). The May 14 primary is crowded, but Bishop and Brown have the airwaves almost to themselves.\n\nThis is Monmouth's first dip into the first primary state, and it finds a bigger cache of support for Biden than any other poll this year; it ends a string of polls that had put Sanders, the landslide winner of the 2016 New Hampshire primary, on top. The key: 68 percent of Democratic voters, when asked whether they want purity or electability, say they prefer the candidate they \"do not agree with but [is] stronger against Trump.\" The news cycle does not reward endless investigations of the same question, but \"electability\" remains a big enough driver to freeze this primary in place until and unless voters begin to see Biden as less electable.\n\nIt's been six months since anti-Trump Republicans began urging Hogan to consider running against the president, arguing that his bipartisan appeal in a blue state could be translated nationally. At one point, in a remarkable bit of wish-casting, New York Times columnist (and Maryland resident) David Brooks suggested that Hogan would be the party's 2020 nominee. That was hasty; Trump, who won 54 percent of the vote in 2016's three-way Maryland primary, does even better in a match-up with Hogan.\n\nAmy Klobuchar. This week, she became the second 2020 Democrat to hold a town hall on Fox News. She largely got to focus on her pitch as a pragmatic \"heartland\" candidate, but most follow-up questions she got were about whether Democrats had shifting standards for judging sexual misconduct, which led Klobuchar to defend her questioning during the Brett M. Kavanaugh hearings. \"He got a really good job out of the whole thing,\" she said. \"He's, like, on the Supreme Court of the United States.\"\n\nBernie Sanders. He told the International Association of Machinists that, as president, he'd put a moratorium on pension cuts; he then joined Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to introduce legislation that would cap credit card fees at 15 percent.\n\nJohn Hickenlooper. He's proposing a change to the attorney general's confirmation process, requiring 60 Senate votes for confirmation, limiting him or her to one term, and preventing him or her from being removed without cause.\n\nMarianne Williamson. She announced her 65,000th individual donation, qualifying her for a spot in the first presidential primary debates next month. \"Thank you to those of you who have seen the possibility of a new American beginning and have been willing to invest in its formation,\" she said. Eighteen Democrats have now said they have qualified for the debates; Williamson is the only one to have done so with donor totals only.\n\nJay Inslee. He announced a New Deal-styled \"climate conservation corps,\" the latest in the series of attempts to put climate at the center of a jobs plan.\n\nSeth Moulton. He tapped Marie Harf, a foreign policy veteran of the Obama administration and current Fox News commentator, as his deputy campaign manager for communications.\n\nOne of the advantages of being a front-runner in your primary is that your every utterance makes news. At a stop in Los Angeles with the city's mayor, Joe Biden took media questions for 15 minutes, some of them newsy (he agreed that undocumented immigrants were entitled to taxpayer-funded health care) and some speculative. What did he think of the risk of a drawn-out primary?\n\n\"What's going to happen is, this field is going to be winnowed out pretty quickly, here in California as well,\" Biden said. \"In order to get any delegates out of a congressional district, you need 15 percent of the vote. To come out of Iowa, you need 15 percent of a caucus. So it's going to work its way through relatively quickly.\"\n\nFor some reason, this made headlines around the country. But the point was obvious. To break it down a bit:\n\nBiden wasn't predicting that his own strength would winnow down the field. It's just how the primaries work; a handful of candidates will be able to carry on after New Hampshire. The \"brokered convention\" scenario doesn't assume that 23 candidates make it through June; it assumes that, for the first time since 1992, more than two candidates stick it out past Super Tuesday. And in 1992, that did not lead to a brokered convention.\n\nAlmost nothing seems to get Democratic voters thinking as seriously about the courts as Republican voters do, but it's worth watching the conservative movement's legal strategy for hints of a backlash. The GOP has been focused on appointing friendly judges, making sure unfriendly ones don't hamper their agenda and trying to get abortion cases to the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Wednesday, Vice President Pence told a meeting of the Federalist Society that it was time for district judges to stop issuing injunctions against regulations proposed by the executive branch.\n\n\"The Supreme Court of the United States must clarify that district judges can decide no more than the cases before them, and it's imperative that we restore the historic tradition that district judges do not set policy for the whole nation,\" Pence said. \"In the days ahead, our administration will seek opportunities to put this very question before the Supreme Court to ensure that decisions affecting every American are made either by those elected to represent the American people or by the highest court in the land.\"\n\nThis actually got less attention than the efforts by Republicans in Alabama and Georgia to pass stricter bans on abortion, with criminal penalties for women who got them, even if the procedures were performed out of state or the pregnancies the result of rape or incest. The intent behind these laws (and similar laws already passed in Ohio and Mississippi) is clear: to test whether the new Supreme Court would restrict abortion rights if a new case got to its docket.\n\nNone of this has really come up in the Democratic primary, so far; there's not much daylight between the candidates when it comes to appointing judges. But it's bubbling under, especially when the candidates engage on an electability question. And it complicates the abortion question that has been wrapping Democrats around their axels. In North Carolina and Montana, Republican legislatures have passed bills to strengthen antiabortion laws to protect \"born alive\" infants; Democratic governors have vetoed them. The plan had been to make Democrats pay for a politically untenable position, but that could be moot if the debate moves back to Roe.\n\n.\u2009.\u2009. 22 days until Democrats head to California for the state party convention\n\n.\u2009.\u2009. 44 days until Jim Clyburn's fish fry in South Carolina\n\n.\u2009.\u2009. 91 days until the start of the Iowa State Fair", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/3d7d47b90d29dda94ed202b914e78624-4500-3000-70-8-AFP_1GA7D9_tstmp_1557433472.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 295135980}, {"uri": "1131927386", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-09", "time": "12:26:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-09T12:26:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2019/05/09/the-health-202-trump-will-call-on-congress-to-protect-americans-from-surprise-medical-bills/5cd305d51ad2e506550b2fc5/", "title": "Analysis | The Health 202: Trump will call on Congress to protect Americans from surprise medical bills", "body": "President Trump walks to board Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House. (Al Drago/Bloomberg News)\n\nIn an address scheduled shortly before noon today, President Trump will call on Congress to pass legislation protecting Americans from the all-too-common problem of surprise medical bills, incurred after a patient receives care from a doctor who is outside his or her health plan's network.\n\nThe president -- who in January directed Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Labor Secretary Alex Acosta to pursue a fix -- is expected to lay out principles he wants upheld in any legislation on surprise billing Congress might consider, lobbyists and advocates confirmed to The Health 202.\n\nTrump's remarks come as a bipartisan group of six senators work to finalize a bill outlining how insurers and doctors should go about settling billing disputes resulting from out-of-network care. That effort is being led by Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and by Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), whose office confirmed she will attend today's address at the White House. The group is expected to roll out legislation by the end of May.\n\nLawmakers aren't targeting just any medical bills that catch people unaware. They are seeking to curtail medical bills widely regarded as truly unfair because patients couldn't avoid them despite their best efforts.\n\nEven when patients carefully select a hospital in their network, they may still end up receiving care during a hospital stay from a radiologist, anesthesiologist or pathologist who isn't part of their insurance's coverage network. As a result, they'll receive higher bills reflecting out-of-network rates -- charges that can amount to thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n\"The pricing is hurting patients, and we've stopped a lot of it, but we're going to stop all of it,\" Trump said during a January roundtable on the subject.\n\nJoe Grogan, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, told hospitals in March they had better address the problem or else expect action from policymakers and lawmakers.\n\n\"If hospitals, providers and issuers don't protect these patients from financial harm, Congress and the administration will need to act,\" Grogan said at the Federation of American Hospitals' annual conference.\n\nInsurers, doctors and hospitals all publicly say they agree that patients should be protected from these kinds of charges. But the effort sets up a potential fight among different stakeholders, as they each try to duck the extra costs that would be shifted away from patients.\n\nBoth providers and insurers agree there should be a process to determine payment rates. The goal here is to bridge the gap between the charge from a hospital or doctor and what insurers say they're willing to pay for out-of-network care. But there are a few different ways to get there.\n\n-- Several previous bills have proposed an arbitration process, where an impartial arbiter examines the figures presented by each side and selects one as the final payment. Proponents of this approach point to New York's baseball-style arbitration process in place since 2015, which has prompted a major decline in out-of-network medical bills in the state.\n\n-- Another approach is to set a fixed standard in which out-of-network care would be reimbursed at a rate such as 125 percent of Medicare rates, or the 80th percentile of rates paid by commercial plans.\n\n-- Some economists have also suggested that bundling payments for hospitals and their on-site doctors could help solve the problem.\n\nThe trick with all these possible approaches is to make sure the payments aren't set too high, which could incentivize doctors to leave a hospital's network, nor too low, to ensure providers still get adequately compensated and that insurers don't gain too much leverage.\n\nAmerica's Health Insurance Plans, the major health insurers association, favors a set payment method, warning that an arbitration process could lead to higher premiums. Doctors appear favorably inclined to both methods, but they've stress that insurers should be required to contract with a sufficient number of doctors and specialists -- a further way to shield patients from encountering an out-of-network physician during a hospital stay.\n\n\"Overly narrow provider networks -- particularly those that lack sufficient numbers of specialists -- are a major factor in unanticipated billing,\" Barbara McAneny, president of the American Medical Association, wrote in an op-ed published Tuesday by the Hill.\n\nAHH: Drugmakers will be required to display the list price of medications in television advertisements, according to a rule finalized yesterday by HHS. The advertisements must also display the sentence \"If you have health insurance that covers drugs, your cost may be different,\" as an acknowledgment that list prices are usually much higher than what insured consumers must pay out-of-pocket for their medications. It will apply to medicines that cost more than $35 for a month supply.\n\nThe regulation, which the pharmaceutical industry decried yesterday, is among a basket of steps the Trump administration is taking to improve transparency in the drug pricing system and put pressure on drugmakers to ease their prices.\n\n\"Requiring drug companies to level with American patients about their prices is about working toward a system where the patient -- not the insurer, not the drug company, not the government but the patient -- is the one in control of her health care,\" Azar told reporters.\n\nOOF: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said she would donate the $4,500 in campaign contributions she has previously accepted from the prominent Sackler family, which owns one of the country's top opioid manufacturers, Purdue Pharma.\n\nIn a Medium post announcing a plan to use $100 billion in federal funding to address the opioid epidemic, Warren criticized the family and its role in the crisis.\n\n\"The opioid epidemic teaches us that too often in America today, if you have money and power, you can take advantage of everyone else without consequence. I think it's time to change that,\" she wrote. \"That's the America we deserve ... An America where, when people like the Sacklers destroy millions of lives to make money, they don't get museum wings named after them, they go to jail.\"\n\nIt's not clear to what groups Warren will donate the funds, the Wall Street Journal's Joshua Jamerson reports, adding the Massachusetts Democrat has received money from numerous members of the family going back to 2012.\n\n-- Warren's $100 billion plan to tackle the opioid epidemic is also an \"eye-catching amount that reflects a broader strategy by Democrats to focus on issues important to President Trump's base where they say he has fallen short,\" our Post colleagues Annie Linskey and Katie Zezima report.\n\nYesterday the Trump administration released a report listing action it has taken to address the opioid crisis, including securing $6 billion in funding from Congress, upping the number of prosecutions of fentanyl traffickers and increasing the availability of medication-assisted treatments and overdose-reversing medication. James Carroll, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, claimed \"significant progress\" in combating the epidemic.\n\n\"The spotlight thrown on the topic by leaders of both parties shows the potency of addiction as a political issue and the continued impact of an overdose crisis that resulted in roughly 70,000 deaths in 2017, most of them from opioids,\" Annie and Katie write.\n\nBut in an interview, Warren insisted Trump \"has been all talk and no action\" and dismissed a question about whether the Trump administration has increased attention on opioids. \"It doesn't matter if you don't back it up with real resources and help for the people who need it,\" Warren said. \"He hasn't made it a priority.\"\n\nOUCH: People living in rural areas are increasingly responsible for the rise in global obesity rates. Our Post colleague William Wan reports a consortium of researchers found in the past three decades, the global rise in obesity has mostly been propelled by unhealthy weight gain in rural pockets, rather than in urban areas.\n\n\"The study -- a massive collaboration by more than 1,000 researchers, drawing on more than 2,000 studies of 200 countries -- found that more than 55 percent of the global increase in body mass index in the past 30 years has come from rural populations,\" he reports. \"The trend was even sharper in low- and middle-income countries, with more than 80 percent of the worsening BMI driven by rural populations.\"\n\nBarry M. Popkin, a University of North Carolina food science researcher who was not involved in the new study, told William: \"It means we need to think of policies that address rural areas or have an effect in rural and urban areas equally. We can't just ignore it anymore.\"\n\n-- Robert Pear, a 40-year veteran of the New York Times and relentless health-care reporter, died this week at age 69. He was, as our Post colleague Emily Langer writes, \"one of the most relentlessly probing journalists on the health-care beat, enlightening readers and rankling partisans with the clarity of his reportage and his savantlike understanding of the federal government and its arcana. With a seemingly ever-present byline on Page One of the Times, Mr. Pear was a constant and authoritative presence in Washington for four decades.\"\n\nAs the New York Times's Sam Roberts writes, Pear tenaciously pursued scoop after scoop, and in the course of more than 6,700 Times articles \"went about his reporting meticulously and, to the wider public, inconspicuously.\" In his memory, the New York Times is retiring the slug \"HEALTH,\" because as editors said: \"it can only be by Pear.\"\n\nMany in the health-care industry, fellow reporters and lawmakers reacted to Pear's death, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.):\n\nAndy Slavitt, who headed CMS under President Barack Obama:\n\n-- Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee batted down a Republican effort to block funding to entities that provide abortions unless certain requirements were met related to babies born alive after attempted abortions, as our Post colleague Erica Werner reports.\n\nThe 23-29 defeat of the amendment by Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) followed impassioned remarks from Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) in support of the measure. She detailed how multiple health-care providers told her to end her pregnancy with her first child, now 6 years-old, who was born without her kidneys. Her first daughter, Abigail, is now doing well and Herrera Beutler is expecting her third child this month.\n\n\"I just think how many other instances are there?\" the Washington Republican told the committee. \"Most of these are moms who want these babies. They're not wanting to terminate late because they didn't want the pregnancies, it's because there's a problem and they were told there's no chance.\"\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) dismissed the Republican effort as a \"ruse to ban safe and legal abortion in the United States.\"\n\n-- Later in the day, the House Appropriations Committee also voted to block a new Trump administration rule aimed at protecting health-care providers, insurers and employers who object to providing or paying for services like abortion that violate religious beliefs.\n\n\"The measure by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) would prevent spending to implement the new rule, which Trump announced last week during a speech before faith leaders,\" Erica writes. Lee's amendment passed on a 30-23 vote along party lines.\n\n\"This dangerous and discriminatory rule attempts to enshrine discrimination in virtually all facets of health care by granting new rights to those who believe their personal beliefs should determine the care a patient receives,\" Lee said. Meanwhile, Republicans called Lee's measure a \"poison pill\" that would hinder passage of the broader spending bill being debated.\n\n-- And the full Democrat-led House plans to vote today on a bill blocking HHS from granting states Affordable Care Act waivers that could make way for some health plans with fewer protections for individuals with preexisting conditions. The White House threatened to veto it.\n\nIn a policy statement threatening a veto, the White House suggested the bill's title -- the Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019 -- was \"misleading.\" \"This bill would not extend any additional protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Rather, it would harm the ability of States to improve coverage for people both with and without pre-existing conditions,\" the statement read.\n\nIn response, Protect Our Care chair Leslie Dach also pointed to Republican efforts to undermine the health-care law and its protections for people with preexisting conditions, including a GOP-backed lawsuit aiming to invalidate the ACA: \"[T]he record shows they'll do everything they can to let insurance companies gut coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions.\"\n\n-- Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s own family is calling out his anti-vaccine views, as the United States grapples with its worst measles outbreak in years that's been in part blamed on the spread of misinformation.\n\nIn a piece published in Politico Magazine, Kennedy's brother former congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-Mass.), sister Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and niece Maeve Kennedy McKean lament the growing number of measles cases that are \"amplified by internet doomsayers.\"\n\n\"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ... is part of this campaign to attack the institutions committed to reducing the tragedy of preventable infectious diseases,\" they write. \"He has helped to spread dangerous misinformation over social media and is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind vaccines.\"\n\nThe trio express their love for Kennedy and praise his work in other areas. \"He is one of the great champions of the environment... However, on vaccines he is wrong\"\n\n-- Shelters at the U.S. border are bursting at the seams after thousands of migrant families have come seeking asylum. For example, one 66,000-square-foot space to house migrants in Tucson is full, the Wall Street Journal's Alicia A. Caldwell reports.\n\n\"The border has seen illegal-immigrant waves before. This one is different,\" Alicia writes. \"Instead of the single job seekers of a decade ago who aimed to sneak in undetected, these are families openly seeking asylum -- more like the groups of refugees familiar on borders elsewhere in the world, where wars, famine and genocide have created massive camps of displaced families with nowhere to go.\"\n\nThis fiscal year, about 248,000 parents and children crossed illegally into the country by April -- more than had done so in any prior full year, according to federal data.\n\nA tent city has opened in Donna, Tex., in the latest effort to house migrant families, but Alicia writes such facilities are only meant to temporarily house 500 family members and unaccompanied minors and \"won't make a dent in the crisis.\"\n\n\"A Homeland Security Advisory Council in a report last month recommended construction of more permanent regional processing centers,\" she adds. \"Without legal changes, they are 'nothing but a welcoming center and will have no impact on stemming the flow of these family units coming across the border in these remote locations,' said Karen Tandy, chairwoman of the Homeland Security Advisory Council panel that produced the report, who headed the Drug Enforcement Administration under President George W.

Behind him, a dusting of cocaine coronates the likeness of an apparent drug kingpin. The back of the shirt declares the wearer a \"cartel member.\"\n\nBut the man on the shirt is no Pablo Escobar. It's Cocaine Mitch -- a.k.a. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose status as the Senate majority leader makes him one of the most powerful politicians in the country.\n\nAnd the shirt is no attack ad. No, it's the newest, hottest-selling item on McConnell's campaign website, where supporters can buy one for $35. The senator's campaign celebrated the shirt's virality on Wednesday by tweeting a GIF that showed stacks of money being counted. They were moving a lot of product.\n\nMcConnell and his campaign's embrace of the nickname is an attempted reclamation of a moniker once deployed against them. Roughly a year ago, GOP Senate candidate from West Virginia and former coal magnate Don Blankenship aired a campaign advertisement that referred to McConnell, without any context, as \"Cocaine Mitch.\" It was an apparent nod to a years-old allegation that the family of McConnell's wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, has a shipping background connected to drug dealers.\n\nThe Washington Post's Fact Checker has debunked this claim and awarded it \"Four Pinnochios,\" meaning Blankenship had absolutely no evidence to support his peculiar assertion.\n\n[The kooky tale of 'Cocaine Mitch']\n\nBut in the months since that ad aired -- and Blankenship lost his primary race -- McConnell and his campaign have repeatedly adopted the name. It's a sign of the senator's good humor, his willingness to take a joke, said Josh Holmes, McConnell's former chief of staff.\n\n\"This all stems from Senator McConnell having a pretty good sense of humor for what, at the time, was a pretty slanderous attack,\" Holmes said. \"It sort of became an online alter ego for Senator McConnell. .\u2009.\u2009. Supporters have rallied around it and love it.\"\n\nBut some policy experts have criticized McConnell and his campaign for selling products that reference and, they say, make light of drug issues.\n\n\"There's something troubling about a politician raising money in this way when so many people are languishing in prison for harsh penalties related to cocaine and other drugs,\" said Michael Collins, the director of Drug Policy Alliance's national affairs office.\n\nAnother critic, Eric Conrad, who has worked for Democratic campaigns, pointed out an apparent double-standard in McConnell's promotion of the Cocaine Mitch brand, writing on Twitter that conservatives like McConnell also typically favor harsher penalties for drug offenses.\n\nMcConnell's campaign responded, writing, \"If we sell enough #CocaineMitch shirts, we'll buy you a sense of humor.\"\n\nBut Andrew Kessler, who founded Sling Shot Solutions, a firm that specializes in behavior health policy, wasn't laughing when he first saw the shirt.\n\n\"One-hundred-ninety-two people die every day from a drug overdose,\" Kessler said, citing government data. \"I'm sorry if my sense of humor is not shining through.\"\n\nKentucky, in particular, has been hard hit with a wave of overdose deaths, fueled in large part by the opioid epidemic. In 2017, McConnell's home state had among the highest age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths in the country, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\n\"It shows me that he is not taking the problem of our current overdose epidemic seriously,\" Kessler said. \"It would be bad enough if he were saying it as Senate majority leader, but to be from Kentucky and doing that, it's reprehensible.\"\n\nBut Holmes said there's no question about where McConnell stands on drug policy.\n\n\"I don't think anyone has done more for fighting drug addiction than Senator McConnell has,\" he said.\n\nAnd his supporters, Holmes contended, recognize the irony in the shirts.

It also underlines the ongoing battle to appeal to white working-class voters, a group that was critical to Trump's 2016 victory and that Democrats hope to court.\n\nMost Democrats believe their path to the White House involves winning back industrial states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania whose populations have been badly hurt by addiction, and they see the opioid crisis as way to expose a gap between the president's rhetoric and his record.\n\n\"Trump has been all talk and no action,\" said Warren in a brief interview Wednesday about her opioid plan.\n\nShe waved off a question about whether the president, who campaigned on solving the opioid crisis, had at least focused attention on the issue. \"It doesn't matter if you don't back it up with real resources and help for the people who need it,\" Warren said. \"He hasn't made it a priority.\"\n\nThe Trump camp would disagree.\n\nAdministration officials say they have made the opioid crisis a signature issue, with the president declaring opioids a public health emergency and first lady Melania Trump highlighting the crisis. Trump appointed a commission in 2017 that made 56 recommendations on combating the scourge.\n\nThe administration has also successfully prodded China to tighten its regulation of fentanyl-related substances. The synthetic opioid is now driving overdose deaths, and most of the illicit fentanyl coming to the United States is manufactured in China.\n\n\"From day one, our mission has been the same -- to save more of our family members, friends and neighbors dying from drug overdoses,\" James Carroll, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, said in a statement.\n\nTrump has also stoked controversy by urging the death penalty for drug dealers, an idea many experts say would do little to stop illegal drug use. And he has made the opioid crisis part of his push for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, though most illicit drugs come through legal ports of entry.\n\nWednesday's announcements come as the presidential field has recently expanded to include former vice president Joe Biden, who argues that he can connect with white working-class voters who flocked to Trump.\n\nHealth experts say Washington's fight against opioids has largely amounted to symbolism or tinkering, and that it has not allocated nearly enough money. Trump's emergency declaration increased awareness but did not result in additional funding.\n\nLeo Beletsky, a law and health sciences professor at Northeastern University, said the federal response to the opioid crisis has been \"abysmal.\" Warren's proposed $100 billion is closer to what is needed, he said, but there should be more explicit attention to structural changes, such as integrating addiction treatment into mainstream medical care.\n\nStill, Warren's approach would be an improvement over Trump's, he said. \"The Trump administration has in many ways fumbled this issue,\" he added. \"It's been primarily rhetoric and not really action.\"\n\nWarren's plan is modeled after the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act, which is credited with stanching the AIDS crisis, at least in the short run. The plan has interested policy experts largely because of the price tag: It's big enough to make a difference in an epidemic that has yet to crest, they say.\n\nWarren has proposed paying for her measure with a new annual tax on the country's wealthiest individuals, which she also wants to use to finance other priorities, including universal child care, canceling billions in student debt, and making tuition free for public colleges and universities.\n\nAs part of her announcement Wednesday, Warren said she would return the $4,500 in political donations from the Sackler family that she has received since 2012. The family controls Purdue Pharma, which manufactures the opioid painkiller OxyContin.\n\nPurdue is facing a cascade of lawsuits alleging that the drugmaker helped drive the opioid crisis, including by aggressively and deceptively marketing OxyContin. The Sackler family has been the subject of lawsuits by attorneys general in New York and Massachusetts. The company and the family deny the allegations.\n\nA spokesman for the Sackler family said that Warren's decision to return the money \"can serve no proper political purpose\" and that the family instead would \"welcome a genuine dialogue with the senator that's fact-based.\"\n\nWarren will highlight her announcement Friday with a visit to Kermit, W.Va., a town of about 400 known as a center of the crisis. It was inundated with about 9 million hydrocodone tablets in a two-year period, according to Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting by the Charleston Gazette.\n\nWarren has made a habit of traveling beyond the early primary states, taking her message to Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee in recent weeks. In the next few days she'll also campaign in Ohio.\n\nHer pitch on opioids goes beyond the white communities that have been devastated by the scourge. She makes a point of noting that residents of majority-black cities struggled with heroin long before the epidemic reached rural America.\n\n\"The crisis has also severely impacted communities of color, exacerbated by existing health disparities,\" Warren said in a post published Wednesday on Medium. In 2017, she said, Baltimore had 692 opioid-related deaths, not far below the 833 in all of West Virginia.\n\nWarren is not the only presidential candidate to see a political vulnerability for Trump on opioids.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), speaking on Tuesday to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, referenced both the Obama and Trump administrations when it comes to addiction treatment.\n\n\"There have been some good things that came out of both administrations when it came to opioids,\" she said. \"But there's still not that kind of funding we need for beds in this country.\"\n\nJenna Johnson contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/st7h92d9-Tz9u3MVXAqjpfbpSZ8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VGHM5CDR4EI6TC7AZJLVM4HJDQ.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4775085", "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 295054500}, {"uri": "1131467225", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-08", "time": "23:15:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-08T23:15:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.501960813999176, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/08/happy-hour-roundup/", "title": "Opinion | Happy Hour Roundup", "body": "Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events\n\nBy Paul Waldman Paul Waldman Opinion writer covering politics Opinion writer May 8 at 6:38 PM\n\n* President Trump today formally exerted executive privilege to conceal some of Mueller's findings.

Mueller III's investigation -- over his involvement in a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer who promised dirt on the Hillary Clinton campaign. Congressional Democrats believe that, during his previous turns on Capitol Hill, Trump Jr. may have lied to investigators about that meeting and whether he told President Trump that the meeting would take place...\n\nAccording to a transcript of Trump Jr.'s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he told lawmakers that he never told his father about the Trump Tower meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. ... Yet in Mueller's report, the president's former lawyer Michael Cohen said that he recalled being in Trump's office when Trump Jr. told him about a meeting to get \"adverse information\" on Clinton.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By Mary Jordan and Mary Jordan National political correspondent and Emily Heil May 7 at 5:57 PM\n\nOne year after Melania Trump launched her Be Best program, she announced Tuesday that she is expanding its most prominent component -- combatting cyberbullying -- to include a comprehensive push for online safety for children.\n\n\"This past year has shown me that children are vulnerable to more than just social media, and so I expanded one of my pillars to online safety,\" the first lady said at an event in the Rose Garden celebrating her program's anniversary.\n\nTrump also said she is planning trips focused on children that will show the world \"that the U.S. cares.\" She did not offer much detail of her plans to expand Be Best, but key online safety issues facing children include sexting, overuse of screen time and learning to identify fake online news.\n\n\"It's everything we want to protect our kids from while pointing them in the right direction toward positive online behaviors,\" said Stephen Balkam, the founder and CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute who attended the first lady's announcement. \"It's a good thing.\"\n\nBalkam said a switch from focusing on cyberbullying to a broader online safety platform could also \"help with the optics that come with this particular White House.\"\n\nThe president has 60.1 million Twitter followers on his @realDonaldTrump account and his tweets have often been called out as at odds with his wife's Be Best message of spreading kindness online.\n\nSince Be Best was launched, President Trump has gone online to label people: \"bozo,\" \"dumb as a rock,\" \"psycho,\" \"low IQ, \" \"weirdo\" and \"crazed lunatics.\"\n\nThe president sat in the front row of his wife's event, applauding. Many top members of the administration also attended, including Vice President Pence, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House adviser Kellyanne Conway.\n\n[Trump defends administration's response to opioid crisis: 'We will never stop until our job]\n\nBe Best, in addition to online safety, has two other pillars: children's social and emotional well-being and opioid abuse. The first lady has focused on the babies born to addicts, but now she will expand her opioid work to \"include kids of all ages.\"\n\nOne memorable moment during the 45-minute event was when Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, took the microphone and urged parents to vaccinate their children.\n\n\"Get them to get their shots!\" Collins said emphatically. Measles was basically eliminated in the United States years ago, but recently the disease has spread in areas where parents have not vaccinated their children.\n\nMicrosoft's Toni Townes-Whitley spoke about making parents more aware of \"family settings\" they can use to limit screen time and promote \"digital civility.\"\n\nAnd, Sinclair TV personality Eric Bolling, whose son died of an accidental opioid overdose, lavished praise on Melania Trump. He said she has saved lives by talking about opioid abuse, including at large events with him. Bolling, formerly of Fox News, called her \"the most important and accomplished first lady in American history. Full stop.\" That immediately set off a heated online debate of what first lady was the \"most important and accomplished,\" with comparisons drawn from Eleanor Roosevelt to Hillary Clinton.\n\nMaryAnne Borrelli, a professor of government at Connecticut College, said there is \"power intrinsic to the office\" of the first lady, but there has been considerable variation in how presidential spouses have used it from Pat Nixon to Michelle Obama.\n\n\"It varies and it's not linear,\" she said.\n\nBalloons at the Be Best celebration at the White House.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nSo far, Melania Trump has kept a relatively light publicity schedule, but many first ladies became more active in their second term. Laura Bush, for instance, made most of her international trips during her husband's second term, visiting 67 countries.\n\nTrump made one solo foreign trip last year -- along with accompanying her husband on others -- and took 15 trips within the United States. And more trips are planned, she said.\n\nBut at least so far, Be Best is not as widely understood as several past East Wing initiatives -- and even its name is puzzling to many.\n\nTo carry out her large mandate, Melania Trump also runs an unusually small office with only 12 employees. She announced Tuesday that she had appointed a \"Be Best ambassador\" from USAID, the international aid agency, and called on other government agencies to appoint an ambassador \"to better highlight and promote the programs and services offered to parents and children.\"\n\nOnline bullying continues to be a huge issue. About 15 percent of high school students said they were they were bullied through Instagram, Facebook, texting or other social media sometime in the past 12 months, according to a 2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.\n\nJustin Patchin, a director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor at University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, said he doesn't really hear much about Be Best.\n\n\"I am not entirely sure what it is,\" he said in a phone interview, adding that what is really needed is money for research into the best programs and methods to curb online bullying.\n\nPatchin said all over the country parents ask what they can do when \"high-profile individuals\" not only call others names online but gain popularity by doing it.\n\n\"I don't want to get political but I just say, 'Look, this is an opportunity for parents to say these kinds of things that are being said -- whether it's by the president, other politicians or other famous people -- and if it's hurtful, if it's mean-spirited, if it's disrespectful, that's not how we treat other people,'\" he said. \"We shouldn't denigrate them.\"\n\nMany on the front lines of the opioid crisis, while welcoming the attention from the first lady and the president, say the focus needs to shift from raising awareness to treatment and how to pay for it.\n\nNearly 48,000 Americans -- about 130 people every day -- died from overdosing on heroin, fentanyl and other opioids in 2017, according to the most recent CDC figures.\n\nBut instead of expanding health coverage for costly addiction treatments, many states and federal health programs are contracting.\n\n\"There is a lot this administration could be doing,\" said Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University.\n\nAsked before the event whether there would be new funding for Be Best, Stephanie Grisham, the first lady's spokeswoman, said \"a successful campaign doesn't always mean spending money.\"\n\n\"There are amazing and successful companies, programs and services already out there. They just need to be highlighted, promoted and replicated -- and that is what Be Best will focus on in its second year,\" she said.\n\nThe program ended when a Minnesota high school robotics team was applauded for building a motorized wheelchair for 5-year-old Rocco Zachow, who cannot walk.\n\nAnd, then the speakers were led to the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden for a reception of lemonade, cookies and lawn games for the children present.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-QmZbti5FFWfWCztTmeUC6S6X4E=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/53XFQUTQ5YI6TEZRGC6FQNXURY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4772911", "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 294963420}, {"uri": "1127346816", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-03", "time": "13:49:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-03T13:49:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/05/03/i-was-meth-addict-thief-today-im-being-honored-by-fbi/", "title": "Perspective | I was a meth addict and a thief.

(Defy Ventures) By Ed Kressy May 3 at 8:00 AM\n\nFor 11 years, I was addicted to methamphetamine. Here's how it went for me:\n\nI thought the FBI was after me, dedicating all available resources to my pursuit. In my mind, an invisible stealth bomber often hovered above me in the San Francisco fog. My family and friends were also spying on me, using cutting-edge military technology to beam disembodied voices at me. Doctored pictures of me had appeared in a Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. This was part of a vast FBI operation with me at its nexus.\n\nLooking back, I think the meth might have had something to do with these thoughts.\n\nOnce, after I'd been arrested attempting to break in to my relatives' home to steal valuables for drug money, I refused to cooperate with police -- instead demanding an audience with the FBI. Cops put me in a locked psychiatric ward for my own protection.\n\nI became a meth addict despite many opportunities I had in life. I earned a college degree and had a successful biotech career. I owned a home in San Francisco, worked for Stanford University (Stanford fired me for violating an arcane Ivy-League-of-the-west tradition that you're expected to show up for work, not hide at home smoking meth.)\n\nDespite my fortunes, in October 2007 I'd sunk low. I hadn't showered or brushed my teeth in months. Mealtimes, I gobbled grub at soup kitchens, shoplifted from supermarkets or used fraudulently obtained food stamps to buy steaks to trade with my dealer for meth. My single-room-occupancy hotel -- sometimes known as a \"flophouse\" -- was evicting me. I was racing toward homelessness, incarceration and possibly the grave.\n\nInstead, at rock bottom, I decided to quit drugs for good. But I discovered that just because you're done with meth doesn't mean meth is done with you.\n\nEven after I stopped using, I sometimes feared the FBI SWAT team would kick down my door and send me to prison for life.\n\nFortunately, help soon arrived. Family, friends and compassionate people inspired me to return to society. Part of that return included giving back to my community by way of volunteering for the Red Cross and for a neighborhood political campaign. Once I began to do that, I felt a shift: Before, I cared mostly about what I could take. As I started to give, I realized it felt good. Strengthened by others' faith in me, even though I had little faith in myself, I began to work hard at working hard.\n\nSoon, the soup kitchen where I used to eat allowed me to volunteer preparing meals for the homeless. An officer of the San Francisco Police Department I used to dread became my 12-step sponsor to help me stay clean. The Toastmasters club where I'd once shown up for free dinner, only to walk out before the meeting began, allowed me to become a member, and after a time, miraculously, its president.\n\nAfter some training, the emergency services sector allowed me to become a volunteer first responder. Me, who used to carry a loaded pistol for protection against people I thought were after me. The San Francisco Fire Department provided hundreds of hours of disaster response training, which I supplemented by earning an EMT certification.\n\nYet all the while, fears of the FBI dogged me. Nights alone in my room, I grappled with dark certainties the Bureau was steps away from ending life as I knew it.\n\nAs part of my self-improvement, I was taking self-defense classes, and I'd become an instructor of Krav Maga, the Israeli self-defense system. I discovered one of my Krav students just so happened to be an FBI SWAT agent. I'd made him aware I participated in fire department emergency training and that I was interested in volunteering for the FBI, too. This was a big step in facing my angst.\n\nOne day after a combat cardio class I'd taught he asked me, \"Ed, would you be interested in organizing an unarmed self-defense session for our team?\"\n\nThat's how, in March 2015, I finally found myself face-to-face with a cadre of real FBI SWAT team agents.\n\nThe irony was not lost on me that for over a decade, I'd been held hostage by terror, the victim of my own mistakes. Yet there I was, freeing myself by volunteering for the bureau. I was helping the very people -- the SWAT team -- I had feared most.\n\nIt was a day of strange turns for me, including when one of the agents, a team lead, offered to sponsor me if I wanted to apply to the FBI Citizens Academy, a selective volunteer program that aims to strengthen relationships with minority groups, faith-based organizations, civic groups and others. It is a six-week series of classes and activities to give community leaders an inside look at the FBI. If anyone needed a greater understanding of the role of federal law enforcement, it was me. I applied.\n\nI was turned down. This happened two more times, but I persevered. My fourth application was finally accepted. (I later learned those rejections were probably due to simple administrative processes.)\n\nIn the days leading up to the Citizens Academy, I waited for the FBI's email saying my acceptance was a mistake. The email never arrived and the academy began. Along with my fellow academy-goers -- mostly tech workers, public safety and community leaders -- we took classes to learn about the FBI. One sunny Saturday we even went to an outdoor tactical range to observe demonstrations, including a bomb disposal.\n\nBut the best part? When I received my diploma on May 15, 2018 -- signed by FBI Director Christopher A. Wray and accompanied by his letter requesting that I, as a Citizens Academy alumnus, serve as an ambassador for the bureau. Me, a former meth addict who once lived in the underworld of drugs and thievery, an FBI ambassador.\n\nIt was hard to believe, but it gets even better.\n\nSix months later, I was invited to speak at a screening of \"Chasing the Dragon,\" a film created by the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration to combat the opioid epidemic (each day in the United States, more than 130 people die from overdosing on opioids). The screening was in November 2018 in Palo Alto, where my old employer Stanford is located. Both the mayor and the chief of police were in attendance. I spoke about my drug abuse, the root causes of addiction, and why I believe positive interactions between addicts and police can help make a dent in the addiction epidemic.\n\nI am now 49 years old, and the next chapters of my story are still to be written.\n\nBut today something monumental is happening: At the D.C. headquarters of the FBI, Wray will present me with the FBI Director's Community Leadership Award for work I've done helping people reintegrate into society after being released from prison. It's connected to work I do with Defy Ventures, a nonprofit providing employment training to people in prison, or those recently released.\n\nThe award recognizes 57 Americans each year, one from each FBI Field Office and the Criminal Justice Information Services Division. Past honorees have educated the public about Muslim culture, founded LGBT community centers and given urban youth alternatives to gangs.\n\nI'm beyond grateful to the FBI and many others for taking a chance on me and helping with my transformation. What I've learned on my path from meth addict, through mental health challenges and finally to community servant is that when people in need are given the right help, we are capable of giving back. And we want to.\n\nToday, one of the least likely people to be receiving a community service award from the director of the FBI will indeed receive it. And let me tell you with extreme certainty: If someone like me can come this far, in your life, anything is possible, too.\n\nEd Kressy is a writer, speaker and volunteer whose work serves addicts and people with criminal histories.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThe Trump administration is making it a top priority to protect doctors, hospitals or other medical providers who object on a moral or religious basis to providing services like abortion, sterilization or assisted suicide.\n\nIn a 440-page rule issued yesterday, the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Health and Human Services said it will use a broader array of tools to enforce more than two dozen \"conscience protection\" laws, some that have been on the books since the 1970s.\n\nThe move was lauded by social conservatives, who have grown to regard President Trump as a close ally for his vocal opposition to abortion rights and other issues dear to them. The president announced the new rule during a midday Rose Garden address timed with the National Day of Prayer.\n\n\"Just today we finalized new protections of conscience rights for physicians, pharmacists, nurses, teachers, students and faith-based charities,\" Trump said. \"They've been wanting to do that for a long time.\"\n\nThe rule, which details how HHS will define religious discrimination and how it will investigate such complaints, is the result of a months-long effort by OCR Director Roger Severino to reshape Obama-era policies in ways that are more favorable to conservatives.\n\nUnder the rule, the administration said it will actively enforce not just three but 25 conscience protection laws, and it drew much broader perimeters around what services providers could opt out of and who is eligible for the protections.\n\nSeverino said beefed-up enforcement is necessary because the office received 343 conscience-related complaints in the last fiscal year, an influx compared with an average of 125 complaints each year under the Obama administration.\n\n\"The rule broadly defines, or in some cases redefines, key terms in the law such as discrimination, referrals and what it means to assist in a procedure,\" my Washington Post colleagues Ariana Eunjung Cha, Sarah Pulliam Bailey and Amy Goldstein report. \"It also meticulously lays out religious exemptions in detail, both in terms of the types of workers that are covered and specific situations that might arise.\"\n\nIt also requires health-care entities to maintain records and report and cooperate with OCR requests. These new mechanisms, Severino said, will ensure \"Congress's protections are not just empty words on paper.\"\n\nThe rule prompted a flurry of response in Washington yesterday, with Democrats and liberals charging that it would undermine care for women and transgender people. Louise Melling, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, told me the rule is a signal \"to encourage people who want to refuse to provide abortion and other health-care services.\"\n\n\"I also think it will have a chilling effect on health-care providers who want to provide those services,\" Melling said.\n\nCommunications adviser to California Attorney General Xavier Becerra:\n\nThe Center for American Progress's Faith and Progressive Policy Initiative:\n\nThe National Women's Law Center:\n\nYet in the past, members of Congress -- including many Democrats -- have passed multiple laws saying individuals or entities shouldn't have to be involved in medical procedures or administer medications to which they're morally opposed. The 25 laws HHS is proposing to enforce include:\n\n-- The Church Amendments, passed by Congress back in the 1970s. The amendments ensure hospitals can't lose their Medicare or Medicaid funds if they refuse to provide abortions or sterilizations based on religious belief or moral conviction.\n\n-- Under the 1996 Coats-Snowe Amendment, federal, state and local governments can't exclude physicians or medical students from public funding or deny them licensing or certifications because they refused to be trained in providing abortions.\n\n-- And the Weldon Amendment, attached to government appropriations bills since 2004, says the government can't discriminate against providers or insurers for refusing to provide, refer for or pay for abortions.\n\nThese provisions, and others, are among the laws OCR says it can enforce more vigorously under the rule finalized yesterday.\n\n\"This rule ensures that government entities don't bully providers out of the practice of medicine, which would result in fewer health-care options,\" Severino told reporters yesterday.\n\nThe last two presidential administrations before Trump issued their own interpretation of how they would -- and wouldn't -- enforce \"conscience protection\" laws.\n\nGeorge W. Bush's administration beefed up and broadened enforcement of some of these laws in a 2008 rule, which allowed OCR to cut off federal funding to state and local government, hospitals, health plans and clinics if they didn't accommodate doctors, nurses or pharmacists who refused to participate in care to which they had religious or moral objections.\n\nThe Bush-era rule also required health-care entities to formally detail how they were complying with federal \"conscience protection\" laws. And it allowed providers to conscientiously object to providing not just abortion and sterilization procedures but contraception too.\n\nA few years later the Obama administration rewrote the rules, characterizing them as too broad. But it still retained protections for doctors and nurses refusing to perform abortions or sterilizations and left in place a process for health workers whose rights are violated to file complaints.\n\nAHH: The Food and Drug Administration announced it would not ban a type of breast implant that has been linked to a rare cancer, following an impassioned hearing in March during which several women demanded the agency take action.\n\nThe agency said it doesn't believe the product \"meets the legal standard for being banned at this time,\" as our Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports. FDA instead said it would bolster efforts to collect and share information about risks involved with the implants.\n\nA specific type of textured implant has been banned or restricted in some other countries due to concerns about breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or BIA-ALCL. The FDA said these specific devices make up only 10 percent or fewer of the implants sold in the United States. The agency had identified 457 cases of the implant-related lymphoma as of Sept. 30 and nine deaths worldwide.\n\nThe FDA said it is \"considering requiring implants to carry what's called a boxed warning -- the agency's strongest safety warning. And it may require doctors and patients to sign checklists of risks to make sure women have the necessary information to make an informed decision,\" as Laurie writes.\n\nOOF: A Democrat in Alabama's House is drawing criticism for his remarks following the passage of a measure making it a felony to perform an abortion at any stage in pregnancy, as our Post colleague Katie Mettler writes.\n\n\"I'm not about to be the male to tell a woman what to do with her body,\" said state Rep. John Rogers as he took to the House floor to express support for a woman's right to choose. \"She has a right to make that decision herself.\"\n\nHe then added: \"Some kids are unwanted, so you kill them now or kill them later,\" he said. \"You bring them into the world unwanted, unloved, then you send them to the electric chair. So you kill them now or you kill them later. But the bottom line is that I think we shouldn't be making this decision.\"\n\nAlabama Senate Majority Leader Greg Reed (R) called the remarks \"chilling.\" \"His comments should be condemned at the state and national level,\" Reed said.\n\nFrom March for Life:\n\nOUCH: A federal jury found five top executives of drug manufacturer Insys Therapeutics guilty of criminal racketeering following a 10-week trial and 15 days of deliberation.\n\nThe top executives, including company founder John Kapoor, were found guilty of charges involving bribing physicians to prescribe the company's potent fentanyl spray to patients who didn't need them. \"The trial brought out evidence that the company paid doctors sham speaking fees and that in one case, an exotic dancer-turned-company executive gave a doctor a lap dance to encourage him to prescribe the spray, Subsys, which is used for pain suffered by cancer patients,\" our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports.\n\nThe case against Insys executives is just one of a swath of cases across the country that aim to hold opioid manufacturers to account for their role in the nation's deadly opioid epidemic. Lenny writes that criminal charges against drug company management are rare.\n\n-- In a separate case, the state of West Virginia and drug distributor McKesson Corp. announced a $37 million settlement in a lawsuit over the company's role in the opioid crisis.\n\nMcKesson did not acknowledge wrongdoing, but agreed to pay $14.5 million this year and $4.5 each year for five years, with money going toward tackling the crisis, Lenny reports.\n\nThe settlement is a record agreement for the state and also marks the largest payment from any of the 13 drug wholesalers that West Virginia has been going after legally.\n\n\"McKesson distributed nearly 100 million doses of oxycodone and hydrocodone in West Virginia -- home to 1.8 million people -- between 2007 and 2012, the state charged,\" Lenny reports. \"That included, for example, 1.3 million doses in Boone County, where 24,629 people lived in 201o.\"\n\n-- Annual deductibles have skyrocketed for people with job-based health insurance, the most common form of coverage for working-age Americans, according to findings by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nOne in 6 Americans who get health coverage this way report having to make \"difficult sacrifices\" to be able to pay for health care, while 1 in 5 report that health-care costs have taken up all or most of their savings. More than 4 in 10 workers who are in high-deductible plans say they don't have enough savings to cover that deductible, the L.A. Times's Noam N. Levey reports on the findings in this first report in a series on high-deductible health plans.\n\nIn the past dozen years, those high-dollar deductibles in job-based health plans have reached an average of more than $1,300 annually.\n\nThe findings are based on a nationwide poll from the L.A. Times, which partnered with the Kaiser Family Foundation, with supplemental analysis from the Health Care Cost Institute and the Employee Benefit Research Institute. \"The explosion in cost-sharing is endangering patients' health as millions, including those with serious illnesses, skip care, independent research and the Times/KFF poll show,\" Noam writes. \"The shift in costs has also driven growing numbers of Americans with health coverage to charities and crowd-funding sites like GoFundMe in order to defray costs.\"\n\n-- Washington D.C. residents may soon be able to legally buy marijuana in the nation's capitol. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced a bill that would legalize recreational marijuana dispensaries in the city.\n\nCurrently, residents in the D.C. can legally grow and possess small amounts of marijuana under a voter-approved law from 2014. It is not legal, however, for residents to purchase pot. And the city can't tax sales of marijuana because of a federal budget provision blocking it from passing or enforcing marijuana legalization laws, as our Post colleague Fenit Nirappil writes.\n\nBowser's \"Safe Cannabis Sales Act\" would rename and task the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration with licensing and overseeing marijuana businesses. \"The minimum age to purchase marijuana would be 21. The bill would also crack down on attempts to avoid the existing restrictions on selling marijuana by offering it as a gift in exchange for purchasing clothing, artwork or other items,\" Fenit writes.\n\n-- As measles cases continue to surge across the country, the spread has put parents of babies too young to vaccinate in a bind.\n\nUsually infants don't get a first measles vaccination until after their first birthday, but as the New York Times's Julie Bosman reports, some parents have been given \"little choice but to chance exposing their yet-to-be-vaccinated babies any time they leave home.\" But it also means some parents are avoiding public areas, including public transportation, malls and playgrounds.\n\nJulie spoke, for example, with parents near Detroit, which has recently been a site of a major measles outbreak. A 29-year-old mother Lucretia Sims said there are \"just some places that we don't go.\" \"I think people have gotten a little selfish,\" she told Julie, talking about families who choose not to vaccinate. \"We depend on the community to take care of each other.

It's a call for real anti-racist policies.", "body": "For two U-Va. professors, Joe Biden's campaign launch raises serious questions.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden takes part in a forum on the opioid epidemic on April 11 at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. (Matt Rourke/AP) By Lisa Woolfork and Noelle Hurd May 3 at 6:00 AM\n\nLast week, much of Charlottesville was buzzing with the rumor that Joe Biden might announce his run for the Democratic presidential nomination here. A sizable contingent of community members, however, including anti-racist organizers, urgently hoped he would not. And indeed, two days before Biden's announcement, Charlottesville City Council member Wes Bellamy affirmed that Biden was not visiting the city.\n\nThursday morning, however, told a different story. Without Biden setting foot in Charlottesville, his presidential launch video managed to transform our hashtagged city from a potential campaign backdrop into a campaign prop. For Biden, #Charlottesville was the event that set in motion \"the battle for the soul of the nation.\"\n\nBiden's video suggests that he is running for president to answer an SOS call from the city. But using footage of the white supremacist attack on Charlottesville is not a sign that Biden wants to dismantle white supremacy. It is a sign of political shorthand and expediency, one that erases the reality of Charlottesville beyond the hashtag and obscures the deeply embedded structures of white supremacy in this city and in this nation.\n\nAs the number of contenders for the Democratic nomination grows by the day, some candidates are looking to draw sharp contrasts with President Trump. This is necessary but not sufficient for a would-be Democratic nominee. To be sure, Trump has aligned himself with white supremacist values in a multitude of ways, doubling down on his comments that play down neo-Nazi violence and commending Robert E. Lee just a few days ago.\n\nCalling out white supremacy and racism is therefore necessary, given the notable uptick in white supremacist violent extremism during the Trump era. But calling out racism and Trump's morally reprehensible speech and actions is not in itself a platform. Mentioning Charlottesville cannot substitute for advancing a genuine racial justice platform.\n\nSuch a platform requires a meaningful understanding of the ways in which white supremacist ideology has been the foundation on which our society was built.\n\nThe white supremacist ideologies that were generated to justify American slavery and maintain a racial hierarchy are hidden in plain sight, coded into our public discourse. Consider, for instance, the continued reverence of Thomas Jefferson, whose legacy infuses the city of Charlottesville. Jefferson is celebrated as the author of the Declaration of Independence but rarely acknowledged for his role in advancing the white supremacist ideology that is baked into every aspect of our democracy. And Jefferson's work as a progenitor of eugenics and an architect of white supremacist thought, though often overlooked, is key to understanding his political philosophy. In fact, it was this white supremacy that attracted the torch-lit mob to his University of Virginia statue, like a moth to a flame, that fateful night of Aug. 11, 2017.\n\nIt is the same white supremacy that drove fierce and violent efforts to oppress blacks in the years after Reconstruction, including President Andrew Johnson's decision to confiscate the land of freed blacks to facilitate the resettlement of Confederate soldiers, the creation of Black Codes and the convict leasing system that instituted slavery by another name, and the legal and extralegal efforts implemented by Southern legislators to prevent blacks from moving north to escape the repressive working conditions they faced during the Great Migration.\n\nIn addition to these efforts, which actively sought to re-create the economic and social conditions of slavery, new laws emerged even in places where plantation slavery had not existed to exploit, exclude and disenfranchise black Americans. These laws included restrictions on where blacks could live and attend school. For example, in the 1930s, the federal government, banks and the real estate industry worked together to prevent blacks from becoming homeowners and to create racially segregated neighborhoods. This process, known as redlining, served to concentrate whites in middle-class suburbs and blacks in impoverished urban centers. Given that public school funding relies largely on local taxes, housing segregation affects the quality of schools students attend.\n\nAll of this means that even after the removal of discriminatory housing policies and school segregation laws in the 1950s and 1960s, the consequences of this intentional segregation in housing persist in the form of highly segregated and unequal schools.\n\nAdd to this a prison industrial complex that literally profits from a racist criminal justice system and voter suppression laws that have been found to \"target African Americans with almost surgical precision,\" and the extent to which a white supremacist agenda permeates every aspect of our society is undeniable.\n\nThe problem with Biden's video is that it engages in a long-standing tradition of our country's leaders remaining unwilling to honestly confront this profoundly racist history. They refuse to ask white Americans to confront the ways in which their African American countrymen and women have remained subjugated long after slavery ended. In fact, within the first six seconds of Biden's campaign launch video, he invokes \"Charlottesville\" and \"Thomas Jefferson\" in warm, nostalgic tones: a quaint college town established by a revered Founding Father, invaded out of the blue by white supremacists.\n\nBut white supremacy is not new to Charlottesville; instead, it is a place that exemplifies how the active residue of white supremacy permeates most aspects of public life in many places around America. Charlottesville is a community with a black population of less than 20 percent, but black people were involved in more than 70 percent of traffic stops in 2017, and were 54 percent of those arrested in the past five years. Just over a month ago, our local schools were closed for two days after an anonymous violent threat against black and brown students as a part of an \"ethnic cleansing.\"\n\nJust a few days ago, a Charlottesville judge -- presiding over the case of city councilors being sued for voting to remove Jim Crow-era statues that once designated the parks as whites-only space -- determined that the Confederate statues were protected \"war memorials,\" discounting the fact that these monuments were erected in the early 1920s at the height of Jim Crow for the purpose of advancing a \"white supremacist future.\" Charlottesville has an untenable public housing crisis facilitated by gentrification but rooted in racist policies like the 1960s-era destruction of Vinegar Hill, a thriving black community in the city.\n\nIt has been 400 years since the first African arrived in Virginia. Since that time, the state's flourishing has unfurled alongside its subjugation of black people. Post reporter Michael E. Ruane describes Virginia as \"the nursery and battleground of slavery, a land of segregation, lynchings and white supremacy, and home to unbending racial oppression and the myth of the Confederate 'lost cause.'\"\n\nCharlottesville is fully implicated in Virginia's racist history. Thus, standing in solidarity with Charlottesville requires deep learning on the part of all Democratic presidential candidates to disrupt the white supremacist thought and deed so entrenched in this nation. Candidates should commit to understanding how our nation's classrooms continue to teach white supremacist pedagogy and tolerate racist imagery. Candidates should be racially literate, aware of white fragility and not easily derailed by discomfort of dealing with it. Candidates who want to engage in a true battle for the \"soul of our nation\" must first take full measure of the contours of its terrain.\n\nIf that candidate were to emerge from this rapidly growing field, it might ensure that our 46th president would be vastly better than the 45th while rejecting the same racist ideology propagated by the nation's third.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LaE2MinHaohhOLIXEU51RvVtX6w=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7GVYHBDH3QI6TJUYFKHYBDE47M.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 294575700}, {"uri": "1127146147", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-03", "time": "09:08:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-03T09:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/us/politics/klobuchar-addiction-plan.html", "title": "Amy Klobuchar Proposes $100 Billion for Addiction and Mental Health", "body": "Senator Amy Klobuchar on Friday released a $100 billion plan to combat drug and alcohol addiction and improve mental health care, focusing one of the first detailed proposals of her presidential campaign on an issue deeply personal to her.\n\nMs. Klobuchar -- who has spoken before about her father's alcoholism, including memorably at Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing -- said she had developed the plan and made it an early focus in part because of that personal experience and in part because of the number of addiction-related stories she had heard from voters.\n\nThe bulk of the plan is divided into three segments.\n\n* Prevention, including funding for mental health programs at schools, training for doctors to recognize early warning signs of addiction and other mental health problems, and a requirement that doctors use prescription drug monitoring programs intended to prevent \"doctor shopping,\" in which patients addicted to opioids receive new prescriptions from a number of doctors.\n\n* Treatment, including funding for addiction and mental health programs and stricter enforcement of the Affordable Care Act's requirement that insurers cover mental health care. The plan highlights in particular the need for more hospital beds and community clinics, especially in rural areas: Some of the counties hit hardest by the opioid crisis are rural, and many of them have no psychiatrists.\n\n* \"Ongoing recovery,\" including job training programs, transitional housing and other social services for recovering addicts. This segment of the plan also calls for treatment instead of incarceration for nonviolent drug offenders and crisis intervention training for police officers. There have been well-publicized instances of officers shooting unarmed people -- especially black men -- who were behaving erratically because of a mental illness.\n\nThe plan also includes funding for suicide prevention programs focused on veterans, farmers, Native Americans and L.G.B.T.Q. people, and for \"an aggressive national awareness campaign to combat stigma.\"\n\nA summary provided by Ms. Klobuchar's campaign said she would pay for the plan by charging opioid manufacturers and importers a two-cent fee per milligram, closing the carried-interest tax loophole, barring pharmaceutical companies from paying competitors to keep generic drugs off the market, and reaching a \"master settlement agreement\" with opioid companies.\n\n(As the opioid crisis has grown, so has the number of lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies and distributors.

The money will go toward state efforts to address the opioid crisis, including rehabilitation, job training and mental health programs, the company said in a statement.\n\nThe payment is the largest from any of 13 pharmaceutical wholesalers the state has been pursuing legally for years. It pushes the total recouped to $84 million, which includes previous settlments with Cardinal Health ($20 million) and AmerisourceBergen ($16 million), according to Gov. Jim Justice (R).\n\nThose companies and McKesson control nearly 90 percent of the distribution of legal painkillers in the United States.\n\nIn 2017, McKesson agreed to pay $150 million in a record-setting settlement of charges brought by federal authorities. Last year the company pledged $100 million toward fighting the opioid crisis.\n\nIn a separate criminal case Thursday, a federal jury in Boston convicted five executives of Insys Therapeutics, including company founder John Kapoor, of racketeering charges for bribing doctors to unnecessarily prescribe the company's powerful fentanyl spray.\n\nThe trial brought out evidence that the company paid doctors sham speaking fees and that in one case an exotic dancer-turned-company executive gave a doctor a lap dance to encourage him to prescribe the spray, Subsys, which is used for pain suffered by cancer patients. The woman, Sunrise Lee, was among the people convicted Thursday.\n\nCriminal charges against drug company management are rare. But last month, federal prosecutors in New York accused two executives of the nation's sixth-largest drug distributor, Rochester Drug Cooperative, of charges that include conspiring to distribute narcotics for non-medical reasons.

April Marks, a spokeswoman for the company, said in a prepared statement that the company \"is committed to working with others to end this national crisis, however, and is pleased that the settlement provides funding toward initiatives intended to address the opioid epidemic.\"\n\nUnder the settlement, McKesson will pay $37 million to West Virginia. Nearly half of the amount is to be paid out within three business days of the case's dismissal, with the remainder paid in annual installments over five years.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, disparaged the settlement as a \"sweetheart deal\" that \"sells out\" the state. \"It's pennies on the dollar to what McKesson cost our state,\" Mr. Manchin said.\n\nThe state will use portions of the settlement money to \"further the collective fight against drug abuse in West Virginia,\" according to a statement released by Gov. Jim Justice and Patrick Morrisey, the state's attorney general.\n\nThe money will support state initiatives including rehabilitation, job training and mental health programs.\n\nMore than 30 states, and more than 1,600 cities and counties and other entities, have filed lawsuits against drug distributors, manufacturers and pharmacies over their roles in the opioid crisis. But huge fines and settlements are nothing new for large drug distributors and may have little impact on their profits.\n\nMcKesson reached a $150 million settlement with the Department of Justice in 2017 over similar allegations, and paid $13.25 million to settle other federal claims as far back as 2008.\n\n[Read more about the role of drug distributors in the opioid crisis.]\n\nThe three largest drug distributors -- McKesson, Amerisource Bergen and Cardinal Health -- supply more than 90 percent of the nation's drugs and medical products and are among the 15 largest American companies by revenue.\n\nMcKesson has enhanced its monitoring of the distribution of controlled substances in recent years, Ms. Marks said, and uses sophisticated algorithms to check for suspicious orders and block shipments to drugstores that reach preset limits. Suspicious orders are reported to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, she said.\n\nIn West Virginia, deaths caused by overdoses of hydrocodone and oxycodone increased 67 percent between 2007 and 2012.

With the drug's sales soaring, Insys became a darling of Wall Street, generating annual sales at one point of more than $300 million.\n\nThe arguments presented at the trial have echoes in cases across the country, where prosecutors and state attorneys general are trying to hold major drug makers, like Purdue Pharma and Johnson & Johnson, accountable for the opioid epidemic that has killed tens of thousands of people in recent years.\n\nBut unlike the amalgam of recent civil lawsuits pending against opioid manufacturers and major distributors around the country, Mr. Kapoor and several former Insys executives were tried on criminal charges. They were accused of racketeering conspiracy, which can carry lengthy prison sentences. In addition to Mr. Kapoor, the other executives found guilty in the case were Richard M. Simon, the former national director of sales; Sunrise Lee and Joseph A. Rowan, both former regional sales directors; and Michael J. Gurry, former vice president of managed markets.\n\nThe former chief executive, Michael L. Babich, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and mail fraud charges.\n\nCriminal charges against drug company executives are uncommon. One of the rare exceptions involved another opioid manufacturer, Purdue Pharma, whose executives pleaded guilty in 2007 to criminal charges that they misled regulators, doctors and patients about the addiction potential of the painkiller OxyContin.\n\nAt the Insys trial, the government suggested executives at the Arizona-based company often operated like drug dealers and that Mr. Kapoor was the ringleader.\n\n\"The decisions, the money, the strategy came from the top,\" K. Nathaniel Yeager, a federal prosecutor, said during closing arguments.\n\nDetails of Insys's strategy from 2012 to 2015 to target doctors and allegedly bribe them have been revealed in lawsuits and news reports for about five years. The trial of Mr. Kapoor and his four co-defendants has brought to light the extent to which the schemes permeated the entire company and its national sales team.\n\nFormer Insys sales representatives, testifying for the prosecution, said their bonuses were tied to the dosages of Subsys prescribed by the doctors they recruited. The higher the dose, the higher the bonus. Evidence presented in court showed that sales representatives had to justify low doses to their boss within 24 hours.\n\nNot only did Subsys cost more at higher doses, but patients were also more likely to become dependent on the highly addictive medication. Subsys is up to 100 times more potent than morphine.\n\nAlec Burlakoff, the former vice president of sales at Insys, has pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy. He wrote in an email read at trial that patients on high doses would be desirable because they \"will continuously refill their monthly prescriptions indefinitely.\" Court filings in a separate case suggest Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, pursued a similar strategy.\n\nTwo Insys sales representatives made a rap video in 2015 about titration, the technique used to increase a patient's dose. The main lyric: \"I love titrations, and it's not a problem. I got new patients, and I got a lot of them.\" The video, in which the salesmen dance alongside a person in a Subsys dispenser costume, was shown at a national Insys sales staff meeting where Mr. Kapoor was present.\n\nTestimony from government witnesses suggested there were few limits to what the Insys sales team was willing to do. Mr. Burlakoff, who testified for the prosecution as part of a plea deal, said the company purposefully targeted doctors with a history of liberally prescribing opioids. \"Pill mills, for us, meant dollar signs,\" he told the jury. \"It was not run the other way. It was run to the pill mills.\"\n\nHolly Brown, a former Insys sales representative in the Chicago area, testified that she saw her boss, Ms. Lee, a former exotic dancer, give a doctor a lap dance hoping it would encourage him to prescribe Subsys.\n\nAfter doctors prescribed Subsys, the company focused on persuading insurance companies to cover the drug, which can cost thousands of dollars a month. Jurors heard recorded calls from the Insys Reimbursement Center in which employees posed as doctor's assistants and invented diagnoses that would smooth the approval process.\n\n\"Insurers were told about medical things that never happened,\" Mr. Yeager told the jury. \"They told deception after deception after deception on recorded lines.\"\n\nBrad Bailey, a former federal prosecutor of drug cases in Massachusetts, said the case highlighted the federal government's efforts to broaden its strategies for curbing the epidemic.\n\nThe government is saying, \"We have got to do something about the flow of opioids in this country -- not from across the borders, not from people's kitchens where they're made and converted -- but from the pharmaceutical companies that are making billions,\" Mr. Bailey said.\n\nIn a similar effort to hold individuals accountable, the attorneys general in New York and Massachusetts have recently turned their attention to the Sacklers, the family that controls Purdue, filing lawsuits that allege members of the family pushed their company to aggressively sell opioids like OxyContin, despite the high risk for addiction.\n\nWhile the legal strategy may be noteworthy, evidence has emerged that aggressive marketing of opioids is far from unique to Insys.\n\n\"The Insys story is symbolic, representative of the kind of conduct, the kinds of things that have been going on behind the scenes to fuel this opioid crisis,\" said Gregory Curfman, deputy editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nGovernment lawyers called witnesses and presented their arguments over the course of two months. Defense lawyers rested their case in less than three days.\n\nBeth Wilkinson, the lawyer for Mr. Kapoor, sought to persuade the jury that many of Insys's marketing strategies were commonplace. Pharmaceutical companies often hire physicians to help promote their medications.\n\n\"In this country, that's not illegal. In fact, it's not even unusual,\" Ms. Wilkinson told the jury during opening statements. Plus, she explained that \"all the information is public\" on the government's Open Payments Data website.\n\n\"Things did go wrong,\" Ms. Wilkinson conceded in closing arguments, but she laid the blame entirely on Mr. Kapoor's colleagues. She singled out Mr. Burlakoff, the ex-vice president of sales who became a star prosecution witness, saying he \"was at the center of it all.\"\n\nLawyers on both sides acknowledged Mr. Burlakoff had a track record of lying and, at the end of one day of testimony, Judge Allison Burroughs called him \"evasive.\"\n\nJudge Burroughs repeatedly questioned whether the government had enough evidence to prove the racketeering charge. Toward the end of the trial, the defense motioned for acquittal, arguing that the government had not proven that there was any agreement between Insys and physicians to write medically unwarranted prescriptions. Judge Burroughs said that while she would defer to the jury, she found this element of the prosecution's case \"pretty darn thin.\"\n\nInsys has struggled to move past its legal troubles. The company's stock currently trades at around $4 per share, down from a high in 2015 of nearly $45, and it has disclosed to investors that it is at risk of going out of business.

Already during my time in office, we have reduced the total amount of opioid prescribed by 34 percent. That's a pretty amazing number.\"\n\n-- President Trump, speaking at a drug summit in Atlanta, April 24, 2019\n\nDuring a recent speech on the administration's efforts to ease the opioid crisis, President Trump asserted that his administration had already achieved its goal of cutting nationwide opioid prescriptions by one-third.\n\nTrump's original goal, made on March 19, 2018, was to reach this target within three years. So obviously we were curious about whether the claim about already reaching the milestone within a year was valid.\n\nHere's what we found out. It's an interesting tale of how data generated in the administration loses its nuance the closer it gets to the president's lips.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe president, after noting the goal to cut prescriptions by one-third, framed this achievement in personal terms: \"Already during my time in office, we have reduced the total amount of opioid prescribed by 34 percent.\"\n\nBut a White House fact sheet, issued the same day, pitched this less as an administration achievement and mentioned no goal, though it kept the time period: \"In the first two years of the Administration, we saw a 34 percent decrease in the total amount of opioids prescribed.\"\n\nFinally, the agency that generated the statistic, the Department of Health and Human Services, was even more careful in its own fact sheet. It cast the percentage decline as tentative and requiring additional research: \"From the President's inauguration in January 2017 through February 2019, initial market data suggests that the total amount of opioids being prescribed monthly has dropped by 34 percent. While we need more data to confirm this snapshot, it shows we may have succeeded in meeting this [three-year] goal already.\"\n\nAs you can see, it is a bit like a game of telephone, with the accuracy of the statement getting diminished with each retelling. Our eyebrows went up when we saw that the statistic apparently was based on monthly data points.\n\nAn HHS spokesman provided the numbers. The data reflected the nationwide prescribing of opioids measured in MMEs (morphine milligram equivalents -- a measure of opioid amount/intensity), drawn from the IQVIA National Prescription Audit, a database for retail pharmacy and mail pharmacy channels only.\n\nJanuary 2017: 13,627,002,271\n\nFebruary 2019: 8,967,556,436\n\n(Technical note: These numbers are not comparable to prescription data on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website because it does not include controlled long-term care environments -- nursing homes and skilled-nursing facilities -- or prescriptions for buprenorphine, which is primarily used for patients in treatment.)\n\nThat's certainly a decline of 34 percent. Experts said that using an MME measure is probably the most useful (though a prescribing rate rather than raw numbers might be more informative).\n\nBut there are several problems.\n\nFirst, two monthly data points are not especially useful to measure long-term progress. We were able to review all of the monthly data, though not publish it. February in recent years for some reason appears to experience big drops, and that happens to be the end point. A three-month rolling average shows a decline, though not as stark as 34 percent.\n\n\"Measuring the decrease using monthly prescriptions is absolutely legitimate,\" said an HHS spokesman. \"We focus on leading indicators to help us better and more quickly respond to this crisis, rather than waiting a year to evaluate what we are doing.\"\n\nBut, more important, time did not start with the Trump administration. Opioid prescriptions have been declining for years, having reached a peak in 2010 or 2012, depending on what data set you use. The declines especially began to accelerate after the CDC in March 2016 issued new guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain -- 10 months before Trump took the oath of office.\n\nHHS has published quarterly fiscal-year data for MMEs dispensed since the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. It shows that decline really sped up in early 2016, about the time the CDC guidelines were issued. The number of MMEs dispensed has fallen about 30 percent from the second quarter of the 2016 fiscal year (January-March) to the end of 2018.\n\nJust looking at second quarter of fiscal year 2017 through the end of fiscal year 2018 -- essentially Trump's first two years -- the decline amounts to 22 percent, from 41 billion MMEs a quarter to 32 billion MMEs.\n\nFinally, we would argue that the president's pledge was to reduce opioids by one-third in three years dating from his speech in March 2018, because he said: \"We're going to cut nationwide opioid prescriptions by one-third over the next three years.\" We reviewed administration briefings after the speech and news coverage and can find no indication it was anything other than a three-year goal starting in 2018. Reporters identified 2021 as the end date.\n\nThat would mean at least a reduction of 12 billion MMEs -- from 35 billion MMEs a quarter at the time of the speech to 23 billion. Backdating to the start of Trump's presidency seems to be moving the goal posts, as the decline in MMEs since Trump's speech is about 20 percent, not 34 percent.\n\nAsked whether progress should be measured from March 2018, the HHS spokesman replied: \"While the March 2018 date marks the release of 'President Donald J. Trump's Initiative to Stop Opioid Abuse and Reduce Drug Supply and Demand,' efforts to combat the opioid crisis were already well underway. The opioid epidemic has been a top priority for the Trump Administration since taking office in January 2017.\"\n\nExperts in the field said the decline in prescriptions is less impressive than it sounds because the trend significantly predates the Trump administration -- and because the more important metric is reducing overdoses.\n\n\"By itself, the number of prescriptions is not a public-health outcome,\" said Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. \"You can't say mission accomplished because the number of prescriptions has gone down.\"\n\nSharfstein noted that even as prescriptions have begun to shrink in recent years, overdoses have soared. (Recent 12-month rolling provisional CDC data touted by the administration indicates the overdose increase may have plateaued and even begun to decline.) The reasons for this disconnect are the subject of dispute among medical professionals, with some arguing that cutting back on opioid prescriptions may have led some people to switch to heroin or synthetic opioids. Other experts say the data does not support that analysis.\n\nIn any case, they said, Trump is wrong to suggest this is an administration success story, even if it has taken steps such as pushing for a reduction in opioid manufacturing.\n\n\"I don't think the Trump administration deserves credit for the more cautious prescribing of opioids,\" said Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University. \"The reduction in prescriptions began in 2012 and improved a bit in 2016. Everything we are seeing is trending in the right direction, but no other country prescribes as much as we do.\"\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nThere are several problems with the way the president framed this statistic. He should have indicated the data was tentative, as HHS responsibly did, but instead he suggests a goal has already been achieved. (As we noted, the goal posts also appear to have been moved.) Moreover, he once again takes credit for a trend that started in the Obama administration, in part because of actions taken under that administration.\n\nThe president earns Three Pinocchios.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7Y2H66tijb8MnNyw4HsuUVIZHsQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q75ERHTG2YI6TJUYFKHYBDE47M.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 294477480}, {"uri": "1125593593", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-01", "time": "11:52:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-01T11:52:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8156862854957581, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2019/05/01/the-health-202-new-cbo-analysis-could-torpedo-medicare-for-all-proposals/5cc85cc11ad2e52459e2470f/", "title": "Analysis | The Health 202: New CBO analysis could torpedo Medicare-for-all proposals", "body": "Democrats eyeing Medicare-for-all are trying to avoid the same trap Republicans fell into back in 2017 when they were trying to replace Obamacare.\n\nThe trap is this: a damaging analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, Congress's official scorekeeper.\n\nThis afternoon, the CBO is expected to release a highly anticipated report on the potential structure and costs of transitioning the United States into a single-payer system. The report, requested by Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), will analyze a number of questions raised by Medicare-for-all proposals, including what services would be covered, what costs consumers would share, how much doctors and hospitals would be paid and how the whole thing might be paid for.\n\nBut Yarmuth notably didn't ask the CBO for a specific cost-estimate of the Medicare-for-all bill proposed by Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), which the House Rules Committee examined yesterday and which more than 100 members of Congress have embraced.\n\nThat score could be sizable -- and probably would fuel charges from Republicans and the health-care industry that Medicare-for-all is an impossible and rash scheme that would jeopardize health care for millions of Americans. The Jayapal measure, which would grant every American a comprehensive health plan with very little cost-sharing, probably would cost more than $30 trillion or even $40 trillion over the next decade, many times the cost of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"There is no avoiding the reality that the Medicare-for-all price tag would not only destroy our current health care system, it would blow up our budget and devastate our economy,\" the Budget Committee's top Republican, Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.), said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats know well how CBO scores can be used as political ammunition. It was only two years ago that they glommed onto the agency's estimates that GOP health-care bills would result in 22 million fewer people having health coverage. Over and over, they whacked Republicans with that figure until the whole repeal-and-replace effort crumbled.\n\nThe CBO report will keep Medicare-for-all on center stage this week, coming on the heels of yesterday's five-hour Rules Committee hearing on Jayapal's bill.\n\nTweets from Jayapal, who attended the hearing:\n\nThat hearing could easily have devolved into little more than a fight over government involvement in health care. But the panel's nine Democrats mostly used it to raise detailed questions about the logistics of transitioning the country's patchworked health insurance system into a single program run by the government.\n\nRep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) quizzed the witnesses on whether Medicare-for-all would result in doctor shortages because physicians would presumably be paid less.\n\nVox's Dylan Scott:\n\nRep. Joe Morelle (D-N.Y.) raised difficulties with paying for a single-payer system by hiking payroll taxes. \"If we didn't go into this with a clearheaded view of what this would mean, I think we're doing a disservice,\" Morelle said.\n\nRules Chair Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) wrapped up the hearing by saying that \"some in the press and watching online have been surprised this was such a civilized and in-depth hearing.\"\n\nEven the committee's four Republicans, who made clear they're not on board with Medicare-for-all, praised the Democrats at times.\n\n\"You kept this focused and very civil,\" ranking Republican Tom Cole (Okla.) told McGovern.\n\n\"I cannot support her legislation, but I support her,\" Rep. Rob Woodall (R-Ga.) said at another point, referring to Jayapal, who was present for the hearing.\n\nThe hearing's seven witnesses mostly maintained measured tones. Two doctors, emergency room physician Farzon Nahvi and retired colonel Doris Browne, told lawmakers the country is already paying for care for the uninsured who visit emergency rooms -- and it's less efficient and more costly because they're not able to visit primary care physicians.\n\nGeorge Mason University economist Charles Blahous said he has estimated Medicare-for-all would add $32 trillion to $39 trillion to federal health-care spending -- but he agreed with Democrats that most of that would be offset by eliminating private health plans.\n\nThe most urgent Medicare-for-all advocate was Ady Barkan, a 35-year-old activist dying of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, who delivered his testimony through a computer because he's no longer able to speak.\n\n\"The ugly truth is this: Health care is not treated as a human right in the United States of America,\" said Barkan. \"On the day we are born and on the day we die, and on so many days in between, all of us need medical care. And yet in this country, the wealthiest in the history of human civilization, we do not have an effective or fair or rational system for delivering that care.\"\n\nVia Vox's Dylan Scott:\n\nYet the lawmakers didn't brush over their differences. Cole called Jayapal's Medicare-for-all measure \"a radical bill,\" saying Democrats have \"not told us how much this massive new program would cost, who would pay for it and how much taxes would have to go up.\" Meanwhile, McGovern stressed that \"health care is a right for all, not a privilege for the lucky few.\"\n\n\"That dispute was part of the subtext that played out in a small House hearing room as congressional proponents of Medicare-for-all put forth their moral, political and economic case,\" my colleague Amy Goldstein writes. \"The hearing offered single-payer proponents their moments in the sun without necessarily moving legislation closer to becoming law.\"\n\nMcGovern:\n\nStay tuned for more Medicare-for-all discussions on Capitol Hill.

Losing those rebates would shift billions of dollars away from them, and they could lose customers if they raise premiums to make up the difference,\" he writes, adding the plans pass Medicare rebates back to the federal government, though they do keep a small percentage of rebates from commercial plans.\n\nAccording to filings with state insurance commissioners, UnitedHealthcare paid $7.3 billion in prescription drug claims and received $4.1 billion in rebates, Humana paid $7.1 billion in prescription claims and received $3.9 billion in rebates, and CVS paid $6.3 billion in prescription claims and received $3.5 billion in rebates.\n\nIf rebates are eliminated, companies like these may raise monthly drug plan premiums to avoid losses, which could dissuade seniors from keeping their plans.\n\nOUCH: A working paper recently circulated by the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests raising the minimum wage and the earned-income tax credit could help reduce the growing suicide rate.\n\nThe suicide rate nationwide has increased 35 percent since 2000, our Post colleague Andrew Van Dam reports. But raising the minimum wage and the EITC by 10 percent each could prevent about 1,230 suicides each year, the report found.\n\n\"There are hints that these deaths are the result of worsening prospects among less-educated people but few immediate answers. But maybe the solution is simple: pursue policies that improve the prospects of working-class Americans,\" Andrew writes.\n\nThe report included analysis of 1999-2015 death data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, examining states that raised their minimum wage or EITC in those years, measuring the change in suicide rates before and after the policies took effect. \"[T]he number of suicides that weren't related to drugs dropped noticeably,\" he reports. \"Among adults without a college education, increasing the EITC by 10 percent appears to have decreased non-drug suicides by about 5.5 percent. Raising the minimum wage by 10 percent reduced suicides by 3.6 percent.\"\n\n-- More young people are attempting suicide using poison, according to new data published in the Journal of Pediatrics.\n\nIn the last decade in the United States, the rate of suicide attempts by poison has more than doubled for people under age 19 and more than tripled for girls and young women ages 10 to 24, our colleague William reports.\n\nThe study also found attempted suicides by poison for people ages 10 to 15 began to skyrocket from 2011 to 2018 after being relatively flat until 2010. During that time, the numbers increased by 141 percent overall, and 338 percent for girls ages 10 to 12.\n\n\"There's something very alarming happening here,\" said study co-author Henry Spiller, director of the Central Ohio Poison Center. \"Even if we don't know why it's happening, it's a major signal that there are big problems in children's lives right now and we as a society need to address them.\"\n\nSpiller and co-author John Ackerman said while they can't answer the \"why\" behind the new numbers, they \"suspect the sudden increase in recent years has to do with the advent of smartphones and how they have made social media much more pervasive in young people's lives,\" William writes.\n\n-- Three hospitals in the District of Columbia have launched programs to provide medication-assisted addiction treatment to overdose victims who come to their emergency rooms, our Post colleague Peter Jamison reports, the city's latest effort to cut its overdose deaths in half by the end of next year.\n\nThe new programs at Howard University Hospital, MedStar Washington Hospital Center and United Medical Center will allow overdose victims to take buprenorphine while they are in the emergency room. The treatment is meant to reduce cravings for opioids, including heroin.\n\nThese programs are part of a series of moves the district has made following a report by Peter in December that highlighted the city's failed response to a growing opioid epidemic. \"Since then, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) has announced a dramatic expansion in the distribution of naloxone, a lifesaving overdose antidote. Federal officials also launched an audit, still ongoing, of D.C. officials' use of $4 million in grant money to treat opioid addiction,\" Peter writes.\n\nThe treatment program using buprenorphine was supposed to launch at United Medical Center, a public hospital in Washington, almost two years ago, but officials had not followed through on the plan, as Peter reported.\n\n-- There are serious discrepancies in the price of identical services common in health care, according to new data from the Health Care Cost Institute that looked at health insurance claims for 34 million Americans. For example, as the New York Times's Margot Sanger-Katz reports, a metabolic blood panel test was found to cost $11 and $952 based on two negotiated prices paid by insurance companies in two U.S. cities.\n\nMargot shares a graphic detailing how the cost of a basic blood test varies in different cities:\n\n\"Although hospitals are now required to publish a list of the prices they would like patients to pay for their services, the amounts that medical providers actually agree to accept from insurance companies tend to remain closely held secrets,\" she writes.\n\nThe Trump administration, which has called for public comments on a proposal to mandate that doctors and hospitals publish negotiated prices, could put an end to the opacity in these prices.\n\n-- New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) announced a ban on alcohol advertisements on city property, including at bus shelters and newsstands, citing concerns public health risks related to excessive drinking.\n\nThe ban takes effect immediately, but spaces that are currently allowed to sell alcohol are exempt, such as restaurants, concert venues and stadiums. Advertisements currently up will be allowed to finish out their contract term.\n\n\"This order banning alcohol ads from City property reaffirms our commitment to health equity and our stand to protect the well-being of all New Yorkers,\" de Blasio said in a statement.\n\n\"In New York City, we see far too many deaths related to alcohol,\" city Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot said in a statement. \"We know exposure to alcohol advertising can lead to drinking more alcohol, more often -- behavior that can be harmful and even fatal.

The rate of attempted suicide by poison has more than doubled among people under 19 in the past decade in the United States and more than tripled for girls and young women 10 to 24.\n\nThe new numbers, published Wednesday in the Journal of Pediatrics, come amid an overall rise in suicides nationwide across age groups and gender. But the sudden and sharp rise in poison-related suicide attempts by children and teens has left researchers and health advocates searching for answers.\n\n\"There's something very alarming happening here,\" said Henry Spiller, director of the Central Ohio Poison Center and co-author of the study. \"Even if we don't know why it's happening, it's a major signal that there are big problems in children's lives right now and we as a society need to address them.\"\n\nSuicide is the 10th-most-common cause of death in the United States and the second- most-common among teenagers and young adults.\n\nDrawing on 19 years of data from 55 poison centers across the country, researchers found that among people 10 to 15, attempted suicides by poison were relatively flat until 2010.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2018, however, the numbers began to skyrocket, increasing by 141 percent overall. The occurrence among girls was particular pronounced. Among girls 10 to 12, for example, the poison-suicide attempts increased by 338 percent.\n\nOf the 1.6 million suicide attempts by youths examined in the study, more than 1.1 million, or 71 percent, were by girls.\n\nPart of that can be attributed to differences in the methods people use to kill themselves that hold true from adolescents to adults.\n\nBoys and men are more likely to employ violent means such as guns and suffocation. Girls and women are more likely than males to ingest pills or other forms of poison.\n\nThe data shows that the rate at which poison-related suicide attempts have resulted in serious injuries or deaths has also increased among young people.\n\n\"The numbers are troubling, and it confirms a lot of current concerns about suicide drifting into younger ages,\" said Christine Moutier, who is chief medical officer for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and was not involved in the study.\n\nSpiller said he is working on a follow-up study that focuses on what poisonous substances are being used most by young people. So far, he said, \"it looks like a wide variety, basically what's in the home: Tylenol, antihistamines, their parents' pills, medication for ADHD, anti-depressants.\"\n\nSpiller said he and others have overlaid their findings with other data to try to identify why the rates have spiked so sharply since 2011. They studied data from the rise of opioid addiction and deaths in recent years, thinking that the sharp increase could be due to increased access to drugs or fallout from parents' deaths or addictions. But the timing did not fit precisely -- the beginnings of the opioid epidemic traces back years before the 2011 spike.\n\nThey also compared it against economic data, but much of the country's downturn occurred in 2008 or 2009.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we can't definitely answer the why. That's not how the data works,\" said John Ackerman, a co-author and clinical psychologist at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nAckerman and Spiller, however, suspect the sudden increase in recent years has to do with the advent of smartphones and how they have made social media much more pervasive in young people's lives.\n\nThe iPhone 3 came out in 2008, Spiller notes, and the Android phones had come into widespread use by 2011. Adults adopted such devices first, but within a year or two, such smartphones became more common among adolescents.\n\nFor years now, across all demographic groups, the death rate from suicide has been rising broadly. Experts cannot easily explain it. There is no single factor driving the phenomenon.\n\nStudies have shown suicidal thoughts among teenagers ages 18 or 19 have increased 46 percent from 2008 to 2017, and suicide attempts among people 22 to 23 have doubled.\n\n\"It's not going to be any one thing that explains these troubling trends,\" Moutier said. \"And the impact of social media on youth mental health is complex, but the research we've seen so far suggests heavy screen time does have an impact on mood, sleep and suicide risk.\"\n\nAckerman at Nationwide Children's Hospital has been working with 125 middle and high schools in Ohio to help them develop stronger suicide prevention programs.\n\n\"There are things we know work, but we haven't even scratched the surface on implementing them,\" he said. For example, he said, universal screening for suicide -- simply asking all students a handful of questions, including whether they have had suicidal thoughts -- has shown to be effective at identifying those most at risk.\n\nBut few schools have such screening programs in place, child advocates say, and there is a shortage of funding, resources and training for suicide prevention in most school systems.\n\nAnother obstacle Ackerman said he often sees among parents and school officials in tackling the rising problem of youth suicides is embarrassment, shame or simply fear they won't know what to say or do.\n\n\"There's this myth that if you talk about suicide you will put it in their minds,\" he said. \"But that doesn't solve the problem. You actually reduce the risk when you have a plan for helping kids through these difficult feelings.\"\n\nRead more\n\nTeenage depression and suicide are way up -- and so is smartphone use\n\nMapping out the causes of suicide in teenagers and children\n\nRegular screening can find teen depression, but getting treatment isn't easy", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WRBuEQxx9y2WWzx-7eqoZzRBozo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PW4WRZDARII6TH7SVPEYJXE65Q.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4757987", "sentiment": -0.4823529411764705, "wgt": 294383340}, {"uri": "1125133228", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-30", "time": "20:06:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-30T20:06:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/opioid-treatment-with-buprenorphine-launches-at-three-dc-emergency-rooms/2019/04/30/b73e0f2a-6b61-11e9-be3a-33217240a539_story.html", "title": "Opioid treatment with buprenorphine launches at three D.C. emergency rooms", "body": "By Peter Jamison Peter Jamison Reporter covering D.C. politics and government April 30 at 3:37 PM\n\nThree D.C. hospitals have launched programs providing medication-assisted addiction treatment to recent overdose victims in emergency rooms, a key component in the District's plan to reduce overdose deaths by half by the end of next year.\n\nHoward University Hospital, MedStar Washington Hospital Center and United Medical Center all have their treatment programs up and running, the D.C. Hospital Association announced Tuesday -- meeting the April 30 deadline established by the D.C. government.\n\nThe programs involve outreach to opioid overdose victims, who will be able to begin taking buprenorphine -- a medicine that diminishes cravings for heroin and other opioids -- while still in the emergency room.\n\nSimilar initiatives have been set up at hospital emergency departments across the country, based on a 2015 study at Yale-New Haven Hospital that showed users who start buprenorphine during emergency-room visits often have more success in recovery.\n\nJacqueline D. Bowens, the hospital association's president and chief executive, said in a statement that the association and hospitals \"have worked with a great sense of care and urgency to launch this most important program as a critical step in battling this terrible opioid epidemic.\"\n\nThe District saw one of the most severe increases in opioid overdose deaths over the last several years, mostly caused by heroin laced with the lethal synthetic opioid fentanyl.\n\nThe city recorded 279 opioid overdose deaths in 2017, more than three times the 2014 number. Deaths dropped to 213 in 2018, according to city officials, a figure that still surpassed the city's homicide total.\n\nWhile America's opioid epidemic is often seen as primarily afflicting rural and suburban whites, most overdose victims in the District are black -- many of them older men who used heroin with relative safety for decades before the arrival of fentanyl.\n\nIn December, The Washington Post reported on the city's faltering response to rising opioid deaths.

(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) By Andrew Van Dam Andrew Van Dam Reporter focusing on economic data April 30 at 10:22 AM\n\nSince 2000, the suicide rate in the United States has risen 35 percent, primarily because of the significant increase in such deaths among the white population.\n\nThere are hints that these deaths are the result of worsening prospects among less-educated people but few immediate answers. But maybe the solution is simple: pursue policies that improve the prospects of working-class Americans.\n\nResearchers have found that when the minimum wage in a state increased, or when states boosted a tax credit for working families, the suicide rate decreased.\n\nRaising the minimum wage and the earned-income tax credit (EITC) by 10 percent each could prevent about 1,230 suicides annually, according to a working paper circulated by the National Bureau of Economic Research this week.\n\nThe EITC was designed to boost the wages of low-income workers, particularly families with children. Many states have supplemented or expanded the credit.\n\n[Why do Democrats love trapezoids?]\n\nRaising the minimum wage and increasing the tax credit help less-educated, low-wage workers who have been hit hardest by what are now known as \"deaths of despair,\" according to the analysis of 1999-2015 death data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by University of California at Berkeley economists Anna Godoey and Michael Reich, as well as public-health specialists William Dow and Christopher Lowenstein.\n\nDeaths of despair, a phrase popularized by Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton in a pair of widely cited 2015 and 2017 papers, typically refers to rising death rates among middle-aged white non-Hispanic Americans.\n\nIn 2017, Case and Deaton wrote that those rising death rates can be attributed to \"drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related liver mortality -- particularly among those with a high school degree or less.\"\n\n[Opinion: The media gets the opioid crisis wrong. Here is the truth. (By Anne Case and Angus Deaton)]\n\nTo evaluate how policy choices could affect those deaths, the Berkeley team identified states that had raised their minimum wage or EITC between 1999 and 2015. They also included states whose wages were affected by federal minimum-wage increases. The researchers then measured the change in the rate for such deaths before and after the policies took effect.\n\nTo control for national trends, they compared the changes with states that hadn't changed their minimum wage or EITC.\n\nThe researchers looked at suicides and drug overdoses. Unlike degenerative liver disease linked to alcohol abuse, those events can be connected to a single point in time.\n\nThe team found little change in drug overdoses, whether intentional or accidental, after the new policies took effect. This falls in line with the growing consensus that, unlike other deaths of despair, drug overdoses probably are linked to increased availability of addictive (and lethal) drugs.\n\n[How fentanyl became the deadly street drug haunting America]\n\nBut the number of suicides that weren't related to drugs dropped noticeably. Among adults without a college education, increasing the EITC by 10 percent appears to have decreased non-drug suicides by about 5.5 percent. Raising the minimum wage by 10 percent reduced suicides by 3.6 percent.\n\n\"When they implement these policies, suicides fall very quickly,\" Godoey said in an interview.\n\nAlthough raising the minimum wage led to an immediate decrease in suicides, raising the EITC had a delayed effect, resulting in fewer suicides the following year, once the tax change came into force. In both cases, it appears as though taking home more money had a positive effect.\n\nThe effect was strongest among young women and others who were most likely to have minimum-wage jobs. Among men, black and Hispanic Americans saw the largest effect.\n\nThe Berkeley team is contributing to a larger body of work that links health, particularly mental health, with economic policy and outcomes.\n\nIn a 2014 analysis in American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, William Evans of the University of Notre Dame and Craig Garthwaite of Northwestern University found that mothers who received a higher EITC reported better mental and physical health.\n\nIn a paper to be published in American Economic Review: Insights, David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, David Dorn of the University of Zurich and Gordon Hanson of the University of California at San Diego drew on data from between 1990 and 2014 to find that the death rate among men tended to rise in cities where jobs were vanishing because of competition from cheap foreign goods.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fEmg7rXyBUYXdaUcxvqkQ3g2Fyg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GDOMAMDKYUI6TJTNVAWT6PMW2U.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4760566", "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 294330840}, {"uri": "1122611425", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-27", "time": "09:14:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-27T09:14:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/27/us/marijuana-california-legalization.html", "title": "'Getting Worse, Not Better': Illegal Pot Market Booming in California Despite Legalization", "body": "COSTA MESA, Calif. -- In the forests of Northern California, raids by law enforcement officials continue to uncover illicit marijuana farms. In Southern California, hundreds of illegal delivery services and pot dispensaries, some of them registered as churches, serve a steady stream of customers. And in Mendocino County, north of San Francisco, the sheriff's office recently raided an illegal cannabis production facility that was processing 500 pounds of marijuana a day.\n\nIt's been a little more than a year since California legalized marijuana -- the largest such experiment in the United States -- but law enforcement officials say the unlicensed, illegal market is still thriving and in some areas has even expanded.\n\n\"There's a lot of money to be made in the black market,\" said Thomas D. Allman, the sheriff of Mendocino County, whose deputies seized cannabis oil worth more than $5 million in early April.\n\nLegalization, Sheriff Allman said, \"certainly didn't put cops out of work.\"\n\nCalifornia's governor, Gavin Newsom, has declared that illegal grows in Northern California \"are getting worse, not better\" and two months ago redeployed a contingent of National Guard troops stationed on the border with Mexico to go after illegal cannabis farms instead.\n\nStepped-up enforcement comes with a certain measure of irony -- legalization was meant to open a new chapter for the state, free from the legacy of heavy policing and incarceration for minor infractions. Instead, there are new calls for a crackdown on illegal selling.\n\nConscious of the consequences that the war on drugs had on black and Latino communities, cities like Los Angeles today say they are wary of using criminal enforcement measures to police the illegal market and are unsure how to navigate this uncharted era.\n\nThe struggles of the licensed pot market in California are distinct from the experience of other states that have legalized cannabis in recent years. Sales in Colorado, Oregon and Washington grew well above 50 percent for each of the first three years of legalization, although Oregon now also has a large glut of pot.\n\nBut no other state has an illegal market on the scale of California's, and those illicit sales are cannibalizing the revenue of licensed businesses and in some cases, experts say, forcing them out of business.\n\nEntrepreneurs in the industry, which spent decades evading the law, are now turning to the law to demand the prosecution of unlicensed pot businesses.\n\n\"We are the taxpayers -- no one else should be operating,\" said Robert Taft Jr., whose licensed cannabis business in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, has seen sales drop in recent months.\n\n\"This is starting to get ridiculous,\" he said of the illegal pot shops, including nearby businesses that list themselves as churches and advertise marijuana as a kind of sacrament. \"It's almost like the state is setting itself up to lose.\"\n\nCalifornia gives cities wide latitude to regulate cannabis, resulting in a confusing patchwork of regulation. Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose and San Diego have laws allowing cannabis businesses, but most smaller cities and towns in the state do not -- 80 percent of California's nearly 500 municipalities do not allow retail marijuana businesses. The ballot measure legalizing recreational marijuana passed in 2016 with 57 percent approval, but that relatively broad support has not translated to the local level. Cities like Compton or Laguna Beach decisively rejected allowing pot shops.\n\nRegulators cite this tepid embrace by California municipalities as one of many reasons for the state's persistent and pervasive illegal market. Only 620 cannabis shops have been licensed in California so far. Colorado, with a population one-sixth the size of California, has 562 licensed recreational marijuana stores.\n\nBut the more fundamental reason for the strength of the black market in California -- and what sets the state apart from others -- is the huge surplus of pot. Since medical marijuana was made legal in California more than two decades ago, the cannabis industry flourished with minimal oversight. Now many cannabis businesses are reluctant to go through the cumbersome and costly process to obtain the licenses that became mandatory last year.\n\nOf the roughly 14 million pounds of marijuana grown in California annually, only a fraction -- less than 20 percent according to state estimates and a private research firm -- is consumed in California. The rest seeps out across the country illicitly, through the mail, express delivery services, private vehicles and small aircraft that ply trafficking routes that have existed for decades.\n\nThis illicit trade has been strengthened by the increasing popularity of vaping, cannabis-infused candies, tinctures and other derivative products. Vape cartridges are much easier to carry and conceal than bags of raw cannabis. And the monetary incentives of trafficking also remain powerful: The price of cannabis products in places like Illinois, New York or Connecticut are typically many times higher than in California.\n\nThe state's illicit cannabis exports appear to be increasing even now, well into California's second year of legalization. New Frontier Data, a data research company that specializes in cannabis, calculates that high demand and more advanced growing techniques will contribute to approximately half a million pounds more illicit cannabis this year compared with 2018.\n\nThe federal government still considers marijuana illegal and the Drug Enforcement Administration says it still investigates marijuana-related crimes. But a spokesman, Rusty Payne, said the agency has a bigger crisis to attend to.\n\n\"We've got our hands full with the opioid epidemic to be honest,\" Mr. Payne said.\n\nIn wildland areas, seizures of illicit pot by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife more than doubled in 2018, the first year that recreational cannabis was legal.\n\nThe department destroyed 1.6 million marijuana plants last year, up from 700,000 in 2017 and 800,000 the year before -- all of them illegally grown.\n\n\"There's a subset of people who are just refusing to get into the process,\" said Nathaniel Arnold, the department's deputy chief of enforcement.\n\nThe Bureau of Cannabis Control, the agency charged with regulating marijuana in the state, has received around 7,500 complaints, most of them about illegal operations, and has sent out more than 3,000 letters ordering illegal businesses to shut down.\n\n\"It's only a matter of time before we start making a dent in the illegal market,\" said Alex Traverso, a spokesman for the agency, who acknowledged there were probably more illegal shops in Los Angeles alone than licensed shops in the entire state.\n\nCat Packer, the executive director of the Department of Cannabis Regulation in Los Angeles, said that even when illicit businesses were shut down, they often soon reappeared.\n\n\"It's been a game of whack-a-mole in the city of Los Angeles,\" she said.\n\nBut Ms. Packer also said the city was mindful that criminal enforcement in the past had disproportionately targeted people of color.\n\nThe city is seeking to find an effective enforcement policy that does not mimic the criminal interdiction policies of the past, Ms. Packer said. One strategy is to turn off water and power services to noncompliant businesses.\n\n\"We can't do Drug War 2.0,\" she said.\n\nMr. Taft, the cannabis entrepreneur, has sent 450 complaints to the Bureau of Cannabis Control and is unapologetic about his calls for an aggressive approach to illegal shops, which he says is the only way that California's giant experiment will work.\n\nHis dispensary pays a cumulative state and local tax rate of 32.25 percent. Unlicensed shops pay no tax.\n\nOne of Mr. Taft's biggest complaints is about Weedmaps, a phone app that allows users to locate marijuana businesses nearby, both licensed and illegal.\n\nIn February last year, the Bureau of Cannabis Control sent a letter to Weedmaps saying the company was aiding and abetting illicit businesses and ordering it to \"immediately cease all activity that violates state cannabis laws.\"\n\nWeedmaps replied that it was a technology company and not under the jurisdiction of the bureau. More than a year later, the company still lists hundreds of unlicensed shops.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Taft resigned as a board member of the Santa Ana Cannabis Association because half the members, he said, were selling illegally and using legalization as a \"shield.\"\n\n\"They are playing both sides of the market,\" he said.\n\nOn a recent weekday morning, Mr. Taft called the Bureau of Cannabis Control to lodge a complaint against his neighbor, a cannabis business that he said did not appear on the list of licensed businesses.\n\n\"We are being pillaged by these people,\" he said. \"My lawyers are ready to launch rockets!\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_fuller@nytimes.com", "name": "Thomas Fuller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/25/us/00cannabis-02/00cannabis-02-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4753024", "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 294052440}, {"uri": "1122302166", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-26", "time": "20:28:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-26T20:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6392157077789307, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/nonprofits-shoudnt-be-so-quick-to-reject-funds-from-tainted-donors/2019/04/26/9fbaa8ba-62db-11e9-bfad-36a7eb36cb60_story.html", "title": "Opinion | Nonprofits shoudn't be so quick to reject funds from tainted donors", "body": "By David Allyn April 26 at 4:09 PM\n\nDavid Allyn is vice president at Graham-Pelton, a fundraising and management consulting firm for nonprofit organizations, and a visiting scholar at the New School for Social Research.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, the National Portrait Gallery in London and the Tate museums, also in London, have all announced that they will no longer accept gifts from the Sackler family. Some Sackler family members are owners of Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, and have been accused of facilitating the national opioid epidemic. Purdue has denied allegations like those made by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey . But it's probably only a matter of time before the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Harvard University and other institutions make similar announcements as well.\n\nThe allegations by Healey and other attorneys general are serious, and the impulse of these institutions to say no to Sackler money is noble. Or, at the very least, savvy public relations.\n\nThese days, brands are expected to be pure, and any hint of corruption or moral compromise can easily trigger protests and harsh online backlash. The threat is as real for nonprofits as it is for celebrities and cosmetics companies.\n\nBut as a former nonprofit chief executive, and someone who now counsels nonprofits on fundraising, I believe that the rush to reject funds from tainted donors is often shortsighted. Nonprofit organizations serve the public interest and should not readily cave in to pressure to return gifts from controversial sources.\n\nThe pressure on organizations to say no to contributions from tainted donors is enormous. Well-meaning activists can quickly marshal vast opposition to an institution. And no organization wants to be accused of taking \"blood money\" -- as the University of Southern California was in 2017 in a Change.org petition , when the university announced a pledge of $5 million from Harvey Weinstein to support female filmmakers.\n\nNot surprisingly, USC leaders quickly reversed course and said they would not take Weinstein's pledged funds. But was it better that Weinstein got to keep his $5 million? Or would that money have done more for the world by nurturing the careers of young female filmmakers?\n\nU.S. charities receive more than $400 billion in donations annually, much of it coming from the ultrawealthy. How many of the ultrawealthy have truly clean hands? And how many of their donations could withstand scrutiny by the online \"cancel culture\" as it grows in fervor and power? Nonprofits themselves are increasingly likely to come under inspection and subject to cancellation.\n\nGiven these factors, the question of ethical gift acceptance will only become more and more urgent. It is critical to recognize that there are distinct types of challenges facing nonprofits.\n\nWithout a doubt, institutions should return money if it was not the donor's to give away - taking stolen property is unacceptable. Accordingly, in 2001, the University of Oregon returned an $850,000 donation from financier Jeff Grayson after a court ruled that the money wasn't even his.\n\nWhat about taking money when a gift seems to be a mere public-relations move by a known wrongdoer? Even the most notorious individuals may have complex motives for contributing to certain causes, and institutions may have complex rationales for accepting the money, but they should balk at slapping a tainted donor's name on a building or program in a quid pro quo for funds.\n\nWhat about anonymous gifts from donors who may have done as much good as they have done evil? It seems inevitable that activists will soon want organizations to reject all money from tainted donors, even gifts that would be publicly designated as anonymous. Already some have argued that anonymity itself is dangerous.\n\nBut a more moderate approach is warranted. First, remember that any money given to a nonprofit ultimately is good for society as a whole. That's why nonprofit organizations are deemed by the Internal Revenue Service to be \"public benefit corporations.\"\n\nWe live in a society that provides limited public funding for social welfare programs. Most arts organizations and social service agencies rely on charitable giving. When nonprofits reject funds from donors -- tainted or otherwise -- we all pay a price. The nonprofit may ultimately be forced to cut back programming, sell property, spend more of its endowment or invest more of its resources in fundraising.\n\nWould you rather visit a new Sackler-funded wing at a museum or see the Sacklers buy another private home?\n\nSome have argued that cultural institutions, instead of returning funds to the Sacklers, should re-donate the money to drug-rehabilitation programs. The idea seems appealing at first, but imagine if the owners of Purdue Pharma had donated directly to a drug-rehabilitation program. The program's directors would no doubt face extraordinary pressure to return the donation amid cries of hypocrisy and reputation-laundering.\n\nLet's not put the goal of shaming wrongdoers above the goal of furthering the common good. Despite activist anger and social media self-righteousness, until governments step up their funding, we would do well to support nonprofits in taking a nuanced, thoughtful approach to the ethics of gift acceptance.\n\nJillian Sackler: Stop blaming my late husband, Arthur Sackler, for the opioid crisis\n\nLetters to the Editor: Blame Arthur Sackler, after all\n\nHugh Eakin: For better or worse, our greatest museums are built on the backs of billionaires\n\nCynthia Wachtell: How to stop the opioid crisis\n\nRobert Gebelhoff: The opioid crisis is too big for justice to stop with the Sackler family", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TObGe8yPDQ_ROGxStlzFSzgaNLk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4QSU5SC4SII6TFRFAHKI2UHPOU.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4754363", "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 294006480}, {"uri": "1122301315", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-26", "time": "20:27:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-26T20:27:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/your-money/notre-dame-donation-backlash-philanthropy.html", "title": "Notre-Dame Donation Backlash Raises Debate: What's Worthy of Philanthropy?", "body": "As flames engulfed Notre-Dame, people from around the world opened their wallets and began making donations. Within two days, nearly $1 billion was raised to help pay for the restoration of the 856-year-old cathedral in Paris.\n\nThe charitable response was a reflection of Notre-Dame's stature as a cherished monument of French cultural heritage. Some benefactors pledged more than $100 million each, including Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, whose wealth comes from luxury brands like Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, and Bernard Arnault, the richest person in Europe and chief executive of the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH.\n\nBut the outpouring met with resistance as critics wondered why tragedies like the incineration of the National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro in September did not receive the same degree of support. And it rekindled class resentment in a city already racked by the so-called Yellow Vest movement, a populist response to economic inequality in France that tapped into a rising global movement against the concentration of wealth.\n\nSome criticism was aimed at donors for not paying their fair share in taxes and thus depriving the French government of the revenue to repair Notre-Dame itself. Others denounced the reputational boost bestowed on philanthropists at a time of national tragedy. And some attacked the premise of giving so much to a damaged cathedral when that money could better benefit social service organizations that could provide food, shelter or a better education to needy citizens.\n\nBut philanthropic experts and advisers said they were not shocked by what seemed like an ungrateful response.\n\n\"It's not surprising,\" said Nicolas Berggruen, a billionaire philanthropist who founded the Berggruen Institute in Los Angeles, which aims to reshape political and social institutions to develop long-term solutions to society's challenges. \"In the age of anxiety, people will look to accuse lots of different groups for all of the evil or some of the evil. Rich people for sure fall into this. Philanthropists are an extension of that.\"\n\nOthers took a less philosophical approach, saying that for society to be most effective, philanthropists need to work with government and the private sector, not alone or in opposition to them.\n\n\"Instead of praising the act of philanthropy itself, people are saying it's not the highest and best use of that capital,\" said Nick Tedesco, senior philanthropic adviser at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. \"When did we get to a place where we feel comfortable criticizing other people's altruism?\"\n\nIf such critical responses toward prominent donations becomes a trend, donors could be forced to rethink big gifts. Some are worried that could have a chilling effect on giving, while others hope it forces people to think differently about what their money supports.\n\nThose who are worried about the backlash think anger over unequal distribution of wealth is bleeding into the wrong areas.\n\n\"There's a lot of understandable concern about wealth inequality and a lot of concern about the bad behavior of some,\" said Phil Buchanan, chief executive of the Center for Effective Philanthropy and the author of \"Giving Done Right.\"\n\n\"But I worry that we're conflating concerns over our approach to taxation with a critique of philanthropy, and I don't actually follow the logic,\" he added. \"I don't believe most big philanthropists are motivated by a desire to maintain the status quo via their giving or to protect themselves from higher taxation.\"\n\nHe said private philanthropic organizations like the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation supported ideas that had become part of the social fabric, like the 911 emergency system and the field of nurse practitioners. And the Libra Foundation, which is backed by a part of the Pritzker family, supplied $350,000 in grants to organizations addressing the needs of families being separated at the United States-Mexico border.\n\nMr. Buchanan said that to solve social problems, all three sectors of society -- public, private and philanthropic -- needed to do the jobs they were meant to do at a high level, not be sidetracked by a backlash.\n\n\"What I'm more concerned about is the broad-brush critique of the whole concept of giving and the under-appreciation of all the good giving has done,\" he said. \"We need a healthy civil society doing different things.\"\n\nMr. Tedesco had a different concern: that already too much money earmarked for philanthropy was not being put to use.\n\n\"With Notre-Dame, you were able to tap into otherwise dormant philanthropic capital,\" he said. \"But that leads to the question: Why is philanthropic capital lying idle? The nonprofit organizations don't know how to compel donors to give.\"\n\nInstead of shying from criticism, philanthropists should accept it as the cost of trying out new things that may not work, Mr. Tedesco said. \"You should be more willing to own that criticism because it shows you're attempting to find solutions or approaches that will ultimately get to success.\"\n\nBut for those who would rather avoid backlash, anonymity is always an option. Caroline W. Hodkinson, director of philanthropic advisory at Bessemer Trust, said some of the firm's wealthiest clients were opting to use limited liability companies to hold money that was earmarked for philanthropy but that could also be used for impact investing. The investment vehicles give donors greater flexibility over how the money is managed, but they also provide near-total anonymity.\n\n\"A private foundation is about the least private thing you can have,\" she said. By meeting Internal Revenue Service reporting requirements, \"you're opening up your affairs to the world,\" she said.\n\nAnonymity on large gifts is also fairly easy to arrange. \"It's a business negotiation,\" said Jared Feldman, who, as the partner in charge of the private client group at the accounting firm Anchin, has worked on four gifts of more than $100 million each.\n\nBut anonymity presents a problem because of its inherent lack of transparency.\n\n\"I'm concerned about the anonymity issue,\" said Lawson Bader, chief executive of DonorsTrust, a donor-advised fund. Knowing who a benefactor is helps build trust, he said, whereas anonymity can hide potential conflicts. For instance, museums are re-examining gifts from the Sackler family, a prominent donor in the art world, after its involvement in the opioid crisis became known. Had the donations been made anonymously, they would not be under scrutiny now.\n\nSome critics hope that the backlash goes beyond assessing the merits of certain donors and donations and instead forces a wholesale re-evaluation of philanthropy.\n\nAnand Giridharadas, author of \"Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World,\" said he found the criticism of the donations to Notre-Dame healthy and wanted to see more of it. \"I've been advocating for exactly that kind of reaction,\" he said. \"It is not hostility to giving. It's simply an injection of skepticism about this kind of exertion of power.\"\n\nWhen philanthropists, particularly in the tech world, make sweeping pronouncements like Mark Zuckerberg's $3 billion plan to cure all disease, Mr. Giridharadas said, society needs to tone down its adulation and be skeptical.\n\nMr. Giridharadas said he would like to see philanthropists make gifts instead to organizations that shake up the social order. \"The kind of giving I advocate is 'being a traitor to your class' giving,\" he said.\n\nUnlike Mr. Giridharadas, who supports shaking up norms, Mr. Berggruen is focused on helping democracies work better by drawing on the best philanthropic traditions.\n\n\"What philanthropists have done in America is much more to put their money to use in society,\" he said. \"The state has a role, but Bill Gates can take more risk than the private sector can and take different kinds of risk than the state can take. In America, on the whole, that's been beneficial.\"\n\nAside from the backlash, the debate stirred by the donations to Notre-Dame has also raised hope.\n\n\"The takeaway form Notre-Dame is, if that can happen in 24 hours, the resources are there to take on major issues,\" said Rob Hansen, founder of Goodnation, which measures the impact of donations. \"Imagine instead of redirecting that billion dollars, we raise another billion dollars to other causes.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_sullivan@nytimes.com", "name": "Paul Sullivan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/26/business/26wealth1/26wealth1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 294006420}]
