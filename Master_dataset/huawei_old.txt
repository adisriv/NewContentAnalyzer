It is yet another example of a civic norm that eroded over decades only to be discarded entirely during the Trump era. By both sides.\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Arthur Vandenberg (R-Mich.) inserted the term into the lexicon in 1947 as he converted from isolationist to internationalist. In the wake of World War II, he backed up Harry Truman on the formation of institutions that remain critical to American security, including NATO.\n\nSeven decades later, the country that pulled the United States into that war by attacking Pearl Harbor is an indispensable ally. Visiting Tokyo this weekend, President Trump repeatedly ripped Joe Biden, who leads in the early polls of Democrats vying to replace him. He even sought to weaponize Kim Jong Un against the former vice president, tweeting that he appreciated recent propaganda put out by North Korean state media.\n\nWhen pressed about seeming to choose a brutal dictator over a fellow American, Trump doubled down. \"Well, Kim Jong Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-IQ individual,\" he said during a news conference on Monday, standing beside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. \"He probably is, based on his record. I think I agree with him on that.\"\n\nBack home, the attacks on Trump from the left certainly did not abate while he was overseas. Foreign policy has become a more salient issue for Democratic primary voters in the wake of the recent saber rattling toward Iran. Several of the candidates have responded by adding language into their stump speeches to criticize the Trump administration's escalation in the Middle East.\n\nStrikingly, the trio of military veterans seeking the Democratic nomination have deployed the most searing attacks on this front. They used Memorial Day weekend to emphasize that Trump did not serve during Vietnam by claiming, dubiously, that he had bone spurs in his feet.\n\n-- Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) repeatedly and explicitly questioned Trump's patriotism over Memorial Day weekend. \"We've had presidents who were immoral, backwards and had terrible policies. We've had presidents who were criminals. I don't think we've ever had a president who is so fundamentally unpatriotic,\" Moulton told Anderson Cooper last night on CNN. \"Even Richard Nixon served his country and was proud to do so. This president is much more interested in siding with dictators, if it's good for his ratings. And that's pretty pathetic for the commander in chief.\"\n\nOn Sunday night, Moulton contrasted Trump with John F. Kennedy -- the last man from Massachusetts to win the presidency. \"He used his father's connections to get medically cleared when he probably shouldn't have been cleared,\" Moulton told MSNBC's Kasie Hunt. \"I don't think that lying to get out of serving your country is patriotic. It's not like there was just some empty seat in Vietnam. Someone had to go in his place. I'd like to meet the American hero who went in Donald Trump's place to Vietnam. I hope he's still alive.\"\n\n-- Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., accused Trump of faking a disability to avoid military service. \"If he were a conscientious objector, I'd admire that,\" he told Bob Costa during a Washington Post Live event on Thursday. \"But this is somebody who, I think it's fairly obvious to most of us, took advantage of the fact that he was a child of a multimillionaire in order to pretend to be disabled so that somebody could go to war in his place. I know that that drudges up old wounds from a complicated time during a complicated war, but I'm also old enough to remember when conservatives talked about character as something that mattered in the presidency. And, so, I think it deserves to be talked about.\"\n\nABC's Martha Raddatz pointed out on \"This Week,\" the Sunday show, that the mayor made this comment at about the same time the president was visiting Arlington National Cemetery to honor the fallen. Buttigieg was unapologetic. \"You have somebody who thinks it's all right to let somebody go in his place into a deadly war and is willing to pretend to be disabled in order to do it,\" he said. \"That is an assault on the honor of this country.\"\n\n-- Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) has made antiwar messaging the centerpiece of her campaign, which has failed to get traction. \"Memorial Day is a time to remember that war should only be waged as a very last resort to keep the American people safe,\" she said on Monday, per ABC. \"So nothing angers me more than the hypocrisy exhibited every Memorial Day by warmongering politicians and media pundits feigning sympathy for those who paid the ultimate price in service to our country, while simultaneously advocating for more counterproductive regime change wars and the new Cold War and arms race.\"\n\n-- \"These baseless attacks from 2020 Democrats are rooted in desperation,\" emailed Kayleigh McEnany, the national press secretary for Trump's reelection campaign. \"As commander in chief, President Trump has the utmost respect for the sacrifice our military men and women have made to keep our nation safe. He has continually made every effort to honor our troops and veterans from fixing the VA healthcare crisis to increasing our military budget.\"\n\n-- After ordering an additional 1,500 U.S. troops to the Middle East at the end of last week, Trump insisted in Tokyo on Monday that he's \"not looking for regime change\" in Tehran. \"We're looking for no nuclear weapons,\" he said.\n\n-- That comment followed a weekend of intense criticism from other 2020 Democrats, who didn't serve in the military, that Trump is not living up to his 2016 rhetoric about getting out of \"endless wars.\" Former congressman Beto O'Rourke (Tex.) said Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" that Trump is \"provoking yet another war in the Middle East.\"\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) spoke at length about his opposition to foreign entanglements during a rally outside the State House in Vermont on Saturday. \"Right now, I am doing everything that I can to prevent Donald Trump and John Bolton from taking us into a war with Iran -- a war which would be much worse than the war in Iraq and could lead, literally, to perpetual warfare in the region,\" Sanders said.\n\n-- Four years ago, in 2015, Scott Walker refused to directly criticize Barack Obama during an appearance at a think tank in London. The then-Wisconsin governor was running for the GOP nomination. \"I don't think it's wise to undermine the president of your own country\" while abroad, he explained. \"When you're in a foreign country, to me, I defer to the president, even though I don't always believe in the same things as he does politically. ... I just don't think you talk about foreign policy when you're on foreign soil. ... Maybe it is a bit old-fashioned.\"\n\nTo be sure, that same year, all but a handful of Republican senators signed on to an open letter by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) to the leaders of Iran warning that they shouldn't count on the U.S. abiding by any nuclear deal that Obama might negotiate. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was invited to give a speech to a joint meeting of Congress opposing the Iran agreement.\n\nThere are examples of politicians going even further. Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign notoriously thwarted peace talks to end the Vietnam War, for example. But he always paid lip service to the idea that politics should stop at the water's edge.\n\nIn 2012, Mitt Romney slammed Obama after the then-president was caught on a hot mic during a summit in South Korea telling Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have more \"flexibility\" to negotiate once he was reelected. John Boehner, who was speaker of the House, chastised Romney. \"While the president is overseas,\" Boehner said, \"I think it's appropriate that people not be critical of him or our country.\"\n\n-- For his part, Obama tried to avoid domestic politics when he was overseas, but sometimes he still wandered into the thicket. He was criticized in May 2016 for saying during a news conference at the conclusion of the G-7 summit, coincidentally in Japan, that world leaders he met with were \"surprised\" Trump had won the GOP nomination. \"They're rattled by it -- and for good reason,\" Obama said, \"because a lot of the proposals that he's made display either ignorance of world affairs or a cavalier attitude.\"\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- The Supreme Court agreed this morning to a compromise on a restrictive Indiana abortion law that keeps the issue off its docket for now. Robert Barnes reports: \"The court said a part of the law dealing with disposal of the 'remains' of an abortion could go into effect. But it did not take up a part of the law stricken by lower courts that prohibited abortions because tests revealed an abnormality. The court indicated it would wait for other courts to weigh in before taking up that issue. The Indiana law at question was signed by Vice President Pence when he was governor of the state.\"\n\n-- Green parties are cheering E.U. election results that vaulted them into a kingmaking position as voters abandoned traditional parties in favor of climate-focused activists in a green wave that swept several countries. Michael Birnbaum, Griff Witte and James McAuley report: \"The results propelled the Greens into second place in Germany and third place in France and elsewhere, amid a surge in excitement from young voters who faulted old-school parties for ignoring their concerns about the environment and offering few alternatives for a generation beset by economic pain following the global financial crisis. In an election for the European Parliament in which far-right, \u00adanti-immigration buccaneers also gained modestly to post their best-ever result, the good showing for the Greens may have the bigger impact on policy. The center-left and center-right parties that long jointly ruled the parliament have lost their majority, meaning they will need to depend on Greens and other centrists to advance their agenda. The far right, meanwhile, captured about a quarter of the seats, up from a fifth -- enough to entrench their angry voices of protest and cause trouble in the legislature, but not enough to actually enact an agenda.\"\n\n-- British voters embraced parties that took clear stances on Brexit. Karla Adam reports: \"Nigel Farage's single-issue Brexit Party was the clear winner of the elections, with the potential to impact the race over who becomes the next British prime minister. The pro-E.U. Liberal Democrats and the Greens -- who also have a simple message on Brexit: Stop it -- made significant gains as well. Overall, support for all the parties that are unabashedly pro-European was slightly higher than for those that are pushing for a hard Brexit. In other words, Britain is as divided as ever.\"\n\n-- Defying his own advisers during his presser in Tokyo, Trump denied that North Korea had fired any ballistic missiles. Ashley Parker and Simon Denyer report: \"Trump gave cover to Kim as he directly contradicted his national security adviser, John Bolton, as well as Abe, by arguing that Pyongyang had not launched ballistic missiles this month or violated U.N. Security Council resolutions. 'My people think it could have been a violation,' Trump said. 'I view it differently.' When pressed, the president added that he was not 'personally' bothered by North Korea's short-range missile tests this month.\"\n\n-- A new report from the United Nations Human Rights Office says that North Koreans are struggling to survive amid corruption and government crackdowns. Min Joo Kim reports: \"The U.N. investigation showed how the rudimentary markets where North Korean people access basic necessities operate in a legal gray area, exposing them to threats of arbitrary arrest, detention and extortion. The report gathers testimonies from more than 200 North Koreans who fled to South Korea. ... Many North Koreans seek a living through rudimentary markets, while paying bribes to get out of duties at official state-assigned jobs, according to the report. The uncertain legal environment surrounding the markets expose the merchants to arbitrary threats of detention and extortion and livelihoods depend on being able to bribe state officials.\"\n\n-- Israel's parliament passed a motion to dissolve itself, putting at risk Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's next term. Netanyahu's conservative Likud party needs the country's ultra-Orthodox parties to converge in order to assemble a 61-seat majority, but the parties are sparring over legislation to replace a military draft law. At the center of the issue is Avigdor Liberman, leader of the Yisrael Beiteinu party, and Israeli officials are now trying to get Trump to pressure him into backing Netanyahu. (Reuters)\n\n-- China continues relentlessly cracking down on its Muslim populations. But Saudi Arabia remains quiet as it tries to strengthen its ties with Beijing. Anna Fifield and Kareem Fahim report: \"Chinese authorities are bullying members of the Muslim minority Uighur community to eat and drink before sundown -- in violation of Islamic rules for Ramadan -- with the implicit threat of punishment if they do not, activists say. ... But Muslim-majority nations have been almost entirely silent -- apparently part of calculated policies to avoid angering China, despite widespread denunciations by the West and rights groups over the treatment of ethnic Uighur Muslims. ... During a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping this month, Saudi Arabia's King Salman said that the kingdom 'is willing to strengthen exchanges with China at all levels,' the Xinhua News Agency reported. His son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, appeared to condone China's treatment of Uighur Muslims when he visited China this year. 'We respect and support China's rights to take counterterrorism and de-extremism measures to safeguard national security,' Chinese media quoted him as telling Xi.\"\n\n-- Chinese tourism to the U.S. fell 5.7 percent last year, marking the first time since 2003 that it slipped. From the AP's Dee-Ann Durbin: \"Last summer, China issued a travel warning for the U.S., telling its citizens to beware of shootings, robberies and high costs for medical care. The U.S. shot back with its own warning about travel to China. Wang Haixia, who works at an international trade company in Beijing, traveled to the U.S. in May for her sister's graduation. She and her family planned to spend 10 days in Illinois and New York. Wang says she might have stayed longer but doesn't want to contribute to the U.S. economy amid the trade war. 'I cannot cancel this trip because I promised my sister I would go to her commencement,' she said. 'My relatives will contribute more than 100,000 yuan to America just staying for 10 days, and that's enough.'\"\n\n-- Germans are being encouraged to wear Jewish yarmulkes in solidarity ahead of an anti-Israel protest scheduled for the weekend. From DW: \"'I call on all citizens of Berlin and across Germany to wear the yarmulke next Saturday if there are new, intolerable attacks targeting Israel and Jews on the occasion of Al-Quds Day in Berlin,' Felix Klein said Monday. He also called on people to take part in pro-Israel rallies on the day instead. Al-Quds Day is an annual event held at the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, initiated by the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979 in support of Palestinians and in opposition to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. Al-Quds is the Arabic name for Jerusalem, meaning holy. In previous years, the event has attracted a range of anti-Israel demonstrators including supporters of Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as neo-Nazis and supporters of conspiracy theories.\"\n\n-- Vandals attacked a Holocaust art installation in Vienna. From Agence France-Presse: \"President Alexander Van der Bellen said he was 'deeply worried' over the assaults. The attack overnight Sunday was the third since the show by Italian-German photographer Luigi Toscano was installed in early May. Faces were cut out of around 80 portraits, an AFP photographer said. Over the past two weeks, others have been daubed with swastikas or slashed with knives. ... Toscano said he was 'devastated' by the attack, the first on 13 such installations around the world. 'There's been vandalism which hasn't been politically motivated, but nothing of this proportion,' Toscano told AFP. 'This is right-wing radicalism.'\"\n\n-- A family in Canberra, Australia, sued Venezuela, claiming the country owes them thousands in rent payments for a property of theirs it had previously used as an embassy. The family alleges that the South American country owes them more than $50,000 in rent. (ABC.net.au)\n\nTHE DOMESTIC AGENDA:\n\n-- On the front page of today's New York Times: \"Trump Administration Hardens Its Attack on Climate Science,\" by Coral Davenport and Mark Landler: \"The attack on science is underway throughout the government. In the most recent example, the White House-appointed director of the United States Geological Survey, James Reilly, a former astronaut and petroleum geologist, has ordered that scientific assessments produced by that office use only computer-generated climate models that project the impact of climate change through 2040, rather than through the end of the century, as had been done previously. Scientists say that would give a misleading picture because the biggest effects of current emissions will be felt after 2040. Models show that the planet will most likely warm at about the same rate through about 2050. From that point until the end of the century, however, the rate of warming differs significantly with an increase or decrease in carbon emissions.\n\n\"The administration's prime target has been the National Climate Assessment, produced by an interagency task force roughly every four years since 2000. Government scientists used computer-generated models in their most recent report to project that if fossil fuel emissions continue unchecked, the earth's atmosphere could warm by as much as eight degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. That would lead to drastically higher sea levels, more devastating storms and droughts, crop failures, food losses and severe health consequences. Work on the next report, which is expected to be released in 2021 or 2022, has already begun. But from now on, officials said, such worst-case scenario projections will not automatically be included in the National Climate Assessment or in some other scientific reports produced by the government.\n\n\"The goal of political appointees in the Trump administration is not just to change the climate assessment's methodology, which has broad scientific consensus, but also to question its conclusions by creating a new climate review panel. That effort is led by a 79-year-old physicist who had a respected career at Princeton but has become better known in recent years for attacking the science of man-made climate change and for defending the virtues of carbon dioxide -- sometimes to an awkward degree. 'The demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler,' said the physicist, William Happer, who serves on the National Security Council as the president's deputy assistant for emerging technologies.\"\n\n-- Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao still has shares in a construction-materials company she pledged to divest from a year ago. The Wall Street Journal's Ted Mann and Brody Mullins report: \"Shares of the company, Vulcan Materials Co., the country's largest supplier of the crushed stone, sand and gravel used in road-paving and building, have risen nearly 13% since April 2018, the month in which Ms. Chao said she would be cashed out of the stock, netting her a more than $40,000 gain, corporate and government filings show. ... Ms. Chao's 2017 ethics agreement, which she signed before her confirmation, said she would receive a cash payout in April 2018 in exchange for the deferred share units she earned while serving on the board, effectively severing her financial ties to the company. ... A Department of Transportation spokesman said the ethics agreement was flawed, because Vulcan's policy calls for directors' deferred share units to be paid out in shares of company stock. A Vulcan spokesman confirmed the shares were paid to Ms. Chao last year. ... The DOT's top ethics official has determined that owning the shares doesn't present a conflict of interest for Ms. Chao.\"\n\n-- Housing and Urban Development regional administrator Lynne Patton acknowledged she might have broken the Hatch Act, which prevents officials from using their government positions to advance political agendas. But she added she \"honestly\" does not care if she broke the law. HuffPost's Nick Visser reports: \"'Just retweeted this amazing tweet from both of my Twitter accounts -- professional and personal,' Patton wrote on Facebook last week, pointing to a message that championed her boss, HUD Secretary Ben Carson, but was critical of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). 'It may be a Hatch Act violation. It may not be.' 'Either way,' she continued, 'I honestly don't care anymore.' ... Patton, who is paid an annual salary of $161,900, according to 2017 figures, is tasked with overseeing one of HUD's largest regions with a budget in the billions of dollars. But when someone pointed out her potential lawbreaking, Patton doubled down on Sunday evening, mocking those critical of her as 'lazy internet parrots' and 'liberal snowflakes' on her personal Twitter account.\"\n\n-- While Trump and his administration, as well as the vast majority of Republicans in Congress, continue to back mandatory vaccination, the anti-vaxxer movement is rapidly infecting Republicans in state legislatures. Politico's Arthur Allen reports: \"Among some of these officials, that libertarian demand for medical freedom has displaced the traditional GOP view that it's a civic responsibility to immunize your kids to prevent the spread of disease. As more politicians take an anti-mandate stand, some end up adopting bogus theories about the supposed harms of vaccination -- threatening to roll back one of public health's great achievements. In Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin said vaccine mandates were un-American. In Oregon, the state party used vaccine mandates to bash Democrats as violating parental rights. And in the California Senate, all 10 Republicans last Wednesday opposed a measure aimed at stopping bogus medical exemptions from vaccination.\"\n\n-- Trump's ban on Huawei products could cut off rural cell-service providers that depend almost entirely on the Chinese telecommunications giant. NBC News's Phil McCausland reports: \"These small telecom companies now face billions of dollars in costs or the end of their businesses entirely after the Trump administration effectively banned the Chinese company last week over spying accusations. It is a prospect that could leave vast swaths of rural America with no cell service. In response, a bipartisan group of senators proposed legislation that would create a pool of $700 million to help local carriers replace their technology. ... The problem is that $700 million is not nearly enough cash.\"\n\n-- Huawei is reviewing its relationship with FedEx after claiming the American delivery company diverted two parcels destined for addresses in Asia and attempted to reroute two others. (Reuters)\n\n-- A group that raised millions of dollars in a GoFundMe campaign to build a stretch of border wall said it has broken ground on private property. We Build the Wall, a private organization, said it has started building portions of the border wall in a New Mexico lot. Kris Kobach, who Trump just passed over for the role of immigration coordinator, is involved. (CNN)\n\nTHERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- Real estate mogul Franklin Haney donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee as he sought government approval and financial support for a bid to acquire a nuclear power plant in Alabama. His donation is now being scrutinized by prosecutors investigating the committee's finances. The AP's Richard Lardner reports: \"Haney, 79, has previously faced accusations that his political gift giving is aimed at cultivating influence. An investigation by House Republicans in the late 1990s alleged that Haney's money and his political pull with senior Clinton administration officials helped him to get the Federal Communications Commission to move into an office building that he had a major stake in. Haney denied any wrongdoing and the Justice Department declined to pursue the matter. But he was charged in 1999 with funneling about $100,000 in illegal contributions to President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and other politicians, then acquitted. A federal prosecutor described Haney as a sophisticated fundraiser who hoped to impress potential business clients with his access to elected officials, like Clinton and Gore.\"\n\nMORE ON 2020:\n\n-- Bernie's 2020 campaign looks a lot like his 2016 campaign, challenges included. The AP's Steve Peoples, Juana Summers and Hunter Woodall report: \"Sanders is struggling with some of the same challenges that sunk his last bid: doubts about his electability, worries about support from minority voters and an opponent with deep ties to the party establishment. As some of his frustrated rivals made changes, Sanders has stuck close to the message, stump speech and campaign style that powered his failed underdog bid in 2016. ... The white-haired self-described democratic socialist is well past the point of reinventing himself or his approach. Example A: As he launched his bid, his campaign told reporters he would adopt a more personal tone on the campaign trail, but Sanders quickly returned to his familiar promises to transform a rigged system that favors the rich at the expense of the working class. ...\n\n\"Armed with a more diverse staff in his downtown Washington headquarters, Sanders has quietly launched a paid media campaign in several South Carolina newspapers that target African Americans. ... Meanwhile, Sanders faces new headwinds in New Hampshire, a state he dominated in 2016. Local Democrats have noticed that Sanders has paid less attention to the state than virtually all his competitors so far; his Monday visit was only his third this year. And as of Monday, he had fewer paid staff on the ground there than little-known former Maryland congressman John Delaney, although more staff announcements are expected soon. Advisers note that Sanders has been particularly focused on the states that will host primary contests on the first Tuesday in March, so-called Super Tuesday. He heads to one of them, California, for a multiday swing late next week.\"\n\n-- Buttigieg is trying to claim top-tier status by juicing his second-quarter fundraising. He's pushing anyone who signs up as a bundler to bring in half their total fundraising commitment by the end of June. (Politico's Maggie Severns)\n\n-- Bill de Blasio raised $458,000 from 115 people who maxed out to his federal political action committee, but very few of the people who cut him $5,000 checks say they actually would vote for the New York mayor. The Times's J. David Goodman writes: \"They said they gave to Mr. de Blasio's federal committee, known as Fairness PAC, for a variety of reasons. Some pointed to his record as mayor. Some said they did so to have a chance to talk to the mayor. Others donated after being asked by another member of their community. 'Honestly speaking, I was asked by a co-worker if I can help, and I did,' said Nail Capri, an executive at a roofing and restoration company who contributed $5,000 last year. In March, Mr. Capri also attended a fund-raiser for the mayor, a Democrat, that drew attendees mostly from New York's Albanian community. So is Mr. de Blasio your candidate for president? 'For me, personally, no,' he said. The same could be said for a better-known $5,000 donor: the billionaire media mogul Barry Diller.\"\n\n-- Rudy Giuliani, Trump's lawyer, is shooting for a big role in the president's reelection campaign. Politico's Darren Samuelsohn reports: \"Now, Giuliani is being cast as someone who can reprise the 'jack-of-all-trades' role he played during the 2016 presidential campaign, helping senior aides brainstorm policy ideas and mark up speeches, introducing Trump at rallies and serving as the president's private sounding board. It also means letting Giuliani be Giuliani during his media hits, drawing eye-rolling fact checks from reporters but giving the president a megaphone for whatever he wants to say, however politically incorrect it may be. 'I think he can be a great warm up act,' said the Trump campaign adviser. 'Having him on the plane is a great idea. As a core messenger he can get sloppy with details and also leave a lot of shrapnel on the ground.'\"\n\n-- The economy is giving Trump a meaningful 2020 tail wind, concedes Steven Rattner, a former counselor to the treasury secretary during the Obama administration, in a New York Times op-ed: \"But how big is that tailwind? Fortunately, economists have worked hard to develop models for predicting election outcomes, and according to one of the best of these, it should be quite large. One of the first -- and perhaps still the best -- of these models was created by Ray Fair, a professor at Yale. He found that the growth rates of gross domestic product and inflation have been the two most important economic predictors -- but he also found that incumbency was also an important determinant of presidential election outcomes. ... In short, while not perfect, the Fair model has done remarkably well. In 2008, it predicted that Barack Obama would receive 53.1 percent of the popular vote; his share actually totaled 53.7 percent. In 2012, when Mr. Obama was running for re-election, its final estimate was a vote share of 51.8 percent, just two-tenths of one percent less than what the incumbent president received.\"\n\n-- Trump is forging ahead with plans to commandeer Fourth of July festivities in the nation's capital. From ABC News's Jordyn Phelps: \"While details of the president's event have yet to be finalized, the White House is facing pushback over the security, logistical and financial strains a presidential event would add on a day where additional security protocols already are in place for the hundreds of thousands expected to flock to the Mall to picnic and watch fireworks. In addition to a presidential address, the administration has ordered that the location of the fireworks display be moved. A source familiar with planning said there have also been talks about adding additional military elements to the regular Fourth of July parade, while the president's orders for a separate, grand military parade remain on perpetual delay.\"\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nAs the president paid a visit, a Wall Street Journal reporter noted this on the uniforms of some airmen:\n\nMeghan McCain asked Amy Klobuchar to refrain from invoking her late father after the Democratic senator from Minnesota told voters in Iowa that John McCain \"kept reciting\" the names of dictators to her during Trump's inaugural address:\n\nThe chief strategist of Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign analyzed Trump's latest attacks on Biden:\n\nFrom a Times reporter covering Trump's trip in Japan:\n\nShe also posed this question:\n\nA Post reporter mocked some takes on the European parliamentary results:\n\nA CNN anchor shared this powerful message for Memorial Day:\n\nThe Navy remembered those who have been lost on Memorial Day:\n\nLawmakers also recognized members of the military for their service:\n\nRep.

An American flag covers the casket. At 8 a.m., I expect a tired expression across the face of each young man and wonder how they will navigate the halls to the narrow chapel. But, stoic and calm, the boys looked at ease. ... Kevin Durazo, the director of campus ministry, began the tradition of providing funerals for veterans with no known living friends or family two years ago when the C.M. hockey team laid to rest veteran John Fitzmaurice. The school considers it a part of its mission to welcome those on the margins into their community -- an active and engaging way for an adolescent to understand the concept of empathy.\"\n\n-- The New York Times, \"With His Job Gone, an Autoworker Wonders, 'What Am I as a Man?'\" by Sabrina Tavernise: \"For Mr. Marsh the plant is personal, but in the three months since G.M. stopped making cars there, it has become political. A parade of presidential hopefuls has come through, using the plant to make the point that American capitalism no longer works for ordinary people. Trump has taken an interest too, berating both G.M. and the union on Twitter, and then suddenly announcing brightly in early May that the plant would be sold to a small company that few people in Lordstown had ever heard of. The news caused a stir. TV trucks showed up at the union hall. But after a few days it became clear to Mr. Marsh that the buyer -- which had no experience in mass vehicle production and quarterly revenues that were less than the price of one high-end sports car -- was probably not a solution.\"\n\n-- One America News Network, a pro-Trump conservative TV channel, has spent years trying to supplant Fox. It has now gained a new fan: the president himself. The Daily Beast's Asawin Suebsaeng reports: \"For the past two years, it has prolifically churned out glowing coverage of the Trump administration and its achievements. OAN's top executives have beseeched the president on Twitter to forget about Fox and to signal-boost them instead. And in the first year of Trump's presidency, the network produced a commercial mocking CNN's 'Facts First' apple-and-banana ad campaign, and declaring OAN the 'Real News.' ... Fox News is still the president's favorite media behemoth. But OAN's team has been catching his eye. This year, Trump has tuned in more often than ever to OAN, two sources close to him say. There's been a conspicuous uptick in his public promotion of OAN's segments, including on his personal Twitter account.

A majority of those surveyed said they expect the central bank to remain on hold until at least the end of this year.\n\n\"It's quite clear there won't be a move this week, or anytime soon,\" said Mathieu D'Anjou, economist with Desjardins Securities of Montreal. While the Canadian economy is beginning to show some signs of spark after a slowdown that began in late 2018, he said the central bank, led by Governor Stephen Poloz, might express more concern about the outlook for the global economy in a statement accompanying its decision.\n\nMore on the Global Economy\n\nTrade Fight, Curbs on Huawei Threaten 5G Growth in U.S. No-Deal Brexit Could Ruin Breakfast in Britain Trade Tension Deals Tractor Makers a Fresh Blow\n\nThe Bank of Canada raised its key rate five times between mid-2017 and October 2018, to the current level of 1.75%. At the last central bank rate decision in April, Mr. Poloz was unequivocal: The Bank of Canada was setting aside past efforts to move rates higher in the face of a domestic slowdown and continued worries about global trade tensions.\n\nRecent economic data suggests the Canadian economy will likely perform better during the first half of this year than the central bank had anticipated. Market expectations are for first-quarter annualized growth of 0.9%, according to CIBC World Markets, compared with the Bank of Canada's most recent forecast of 0.3%. Many economists anticipate the second quarter will come in somewhere above 2.0%, well above the Bank of Canada's estimate of 1.3%.\n\nAlso offering some comfort is the U.S. decision this month to remove steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico. That removes both a trade irritant and some uncertainty related to ratification of a revised North American free-trade pact, economists said. Canada had tied ratification of the renegotiated deal to the removal of the metals tariffs.\n\nHowever, most analysts contend these positive developments wouldn't prompt the Bank of Canada to change course. They said Canada's domestic growth remains relatively muted, and the global outlook has worsened because of heightened tension between the U.S. and China. The U.S. is Canada's most important trading partner, the destination for roughly three-quarters of Canadian exports.\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. increased tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods, prompting an announcement from Beijing that it would boost duties on $60 billion worth of U.S. products beginning in June.\n\n\"The global economy looks as risky as ever,\" CIBC World Markets economist Avery Shenfeld said. Policy makers at the Bank of Canada were concerned about global uncertainties before, he said, \"and those have clearly gotten worse, given the stalemate between the U.S. and China.\"", "source": {"uri": "wsj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-77412/social", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": null, "wgt": 296747580}, {"uri": "1147414088", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-28", "time": "12:49:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-28T12:49:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-technology-202/2019/05/28/the-technology-202-doctored-pelosi-video-is-leading-tip-in-coming-disinformation-battle/5cec9b961ad2e52231e8e810/", "title": "Analysis | The Technology 202: Doctored Pelosi video is leading tip in coming disinformation battle", "body": "The viral spread last week of a crudely doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi highlighted the lack of preparation by the United States for the next frontier in disinformation.\n\nThe Pelosi footage wasn't a deepfake, or videos doctored with artificial intelligence to make it appear people are doing or saying things they never did. But the video -- altered to make Pelosi appear drunk through slowing down the footage and appearing to alter the speaker's pitch -- showed just how quickly even something supposedly less egregious could ricochet through all corners of the Internet.\n\nAnd it is a cautionary tale about what's to come: If a doctored video could go viral and be shared by a top associate of the president, experts warn disinformation challenges may only intensify as deepfake technology advances and becomes more common.\n\nRep. Will Hurd (R-Texas), a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, warned on CBS;s \"Face The Nation\" that the country isn't prepared for the coming onslaught.\n\n\"This wasn't even a deepfake,\" Hurd said on Sunday. \"In this case, at least we had the original to compare the two and recognize that it was doctored in a former fashion. Soon -- I think within months -- we're going to see this deepfake technology continue to grow, we're going to see that more and we're not prepared.\"\n\nThere's broad agreement in Washington that there will be a repeat of disinformation tactics ahead of the 2020 elections. But Hurd's comments underscore that little effort has been made in Washington to get ahead of new the tactics bad actors may use to sway public opinion.\n\n\"We have old laws to decide how you handle disinformation. You have leaders that don't understand how this technology can be used in the future,\" Hurd said. \"This goes back into this whole conversation about disinformation and how are we dealing with it.\"\n\nThere have been previous efforts on Capitol Hill to spotlight deepfakes. Last year, senators pressed executives from Facebook and Twitter about the technology in a hearing about election security.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) in 2018 warned the technology could send the disinformation crisis into overdrive. Warner floated the idea of holding social media platforms liable for failure to take down deepfakes in a widely circulated policy paper last summer.\n\nBut recently, there's been less pressure on the issue on the Hill. Last week when the House held a hearing with technology company executives about election security, there was little curiosity from lawmakers on how disinformation threats are evolving. The panel instead focused its time on the issue of alleged anti-conservative bias on social media platforms.\n\nOn Sunday's show, Hurd made the case that government and social media companies -- as well as the media and academia -- are going to have to work together to address these new challenges. However, it's unclear what role the social media companies will play in policing deepfakes without intervention from lawmakers.\n\nThe Pelosi video also highlighted how the platforms have a wide range of different policies when it comes to removing false content. The Pelosi video gained much of it its audience from Facebook. However, the company refused to remove the video, acknowledging it was fake but saying it didn't violate the company's policies.\n\n\"We don't have a policy that stipulates that the information you post on Facebook must be true,\" Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post.\n\nMeanwhile, YouTube removed the Pelosi videos because they violated \"clear policies that outline what content is not acceptable to post.\" Twitter declined to comment, but my colleague Drew Harwell noted sharing the video would likely not violate the company's policies, which allow \"inaccurate statements about an elected official\" as long as they don't include efforts of election manipulation or voter suppression.\n\nThe viral Pelosi incident could ramp up lawmakers' scrutiny of the diverging company policies on false information. Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), one of Facebook's top critics in Washington, called the company out on Twitter for leaving the video up:\n\nAnd from Sen.

They're unsure how the Trump administration's order targeting the Chinese telecommunications company will impact Android support to popular phones made by Huawei, Amie Tsang and Adam Satariano report in the New York Times.\n\n\"The move by Google this week to cut off Android support to phones made by Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, will hobble their European users and highlights how deeply the Continent relies on American and Chinese companies for gadgets, apps and internet services,\" the New York Times reports.\n\nGoogle's move is \"potentially catastrophic\" for Huawei's ambitions in Europe, Ben Stanton, a senior analyst at Canalys, a research firm, told the Times.\n\nThe Trump administration issued an executive order earlier this month barring U.S. firms from using Chinese telecommunications equipment that could pose a threat to U.S. national security, which it has accused Huawei of doing. But the Times notes U.S. restrictions on Huawei's business will likely impact European customers more than Americans or Chinese citizens. That's because Huawei equipment isn't widely available in the U.S., and U.S. tech services are largely banned in China.\n\n\"But [Huawei phones] are best sellers in countries like Greece, Portugal and Spain,\" the Times notes. \"Those phones, plus robust sales of telecommunications equipment, have made the market covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa into Huawei's second biggest after China. It accounted for 28 percent of Huawei's revenue in 2018, compared with 7 percent from the Americas.\"\n\nNIBBLES: Temps and contract workers now outnumber full-time employees at Google, underscoring how the tech company relies heavily on a shadow workforce around the world that does not enjoy the same benefits and pay as its full-time workers, Daisuke Wakabayashi writes in the New York Times.\n\n\"High-tech companies have long promoted the idea that they are egalitarian, idyllic workplaces. And Google, perhaps more than any other, has represented that image, with a reputation for enviable salaries and benefits and lavish perks,\" Daisuke writes. \"But the company's increasing reliance on temps and contractors has some Google employees wondering if management is undermining its carefully crafted culture.\"\n\nAs of March, Google had 102,000 full-time employees around the world. But it was working with roughly 121,000 contractors.\n\nContractors often work alongside full-time employees, but they make less, have different benefit plans and have no vacation time in the U.S. As Google employees become more engaged in activism, giving these workers better treatment has been a priority. Those benefits were included last year in employee demands when they staged a walkout related to the company's handling of sexual harassment last year.\n\n\"It's time to end the two-tier system that treats some workers as expendable,\" the walkout organizers wrote on Twitter in March.\n\nBYTES: A top Apple executive pushed back on Google chief executive Sundar Pichai's stance that privacy shouldn't be a \"luxury good\" in an interview with The Independent's Andrew Griffin.\n\n\"I don't buy into the luxury good dig,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering told The Independent in a recent interview.\n\n\"On the one hand gratifying that other companies in space over the last few months, seemed to be making a lot of positive noises about caring about privacy. I think it's a deeper issue than then, what a couple of months and a couple of press releases would make. I think you've got to look fundamentally at company cultures and values and business model. And those don't change overnight.\"\n\n\"But we certainly seek to both set a great example for the world to show what's possible to raise people's expectations about what they should expect the products, whether they get them from us or from other people. And of course, we love, ultimately, to sell Apple products to everyone we possibly could certainly not just a luxury, we think a great product experience is something everyone should have. So we aspire to develop those.\"\n\nIn a recent New York Times op-ed about privacy, Pichai wrote, \"privacy cannot be a luxury good offered only to people who can afford to buy premium products and services. Privacy must be equally available to everyone in the world.\"\n\nThough the Google chief executive never directly mentioned Apple -- it was clear he was taking a jab at the smartphone maker, which has been positioning itself as the most privacy-focused of its industry peers.

(Mark Schiefelbein/AP) By Gerry Shih Gerry Shih China Correspondent May 28 at 8:30 AM\n\nBEIJING -- One is a star of one of President Trump's favorite television networks, Fox Business, the other is a polished debater on Chinese state media known for her confidence in China's rise and scorn for \"biased\" Western media.\n\nAfter weeks of back-and-forth sniping on television and Twitter, Trish Regan from the Fox Business Network and Liu Xin from China Global Television Network are facing off Wednesday night on Regan's show to argue on behalf of their respective governments about tariffs and technology.\n\nThe debate might be just another weeknight segment for Fox Business, but it's eagerly anticipated in China, where nationalism and distaste for the United States are running high as the White House tightens the screws on Beijing in their ongoing trade dispute.\n\n\"With anchorwomen like her, and companies like Huawei, why would China need to worry about its rise?\" read a typical patriotic comment on Chinese social media praising Liu, who is one of China's best known faces despite her regular show appearing on an English-language channel.\n\nHashtags about the upcoming debate have been viewed upward of 150 million times, with some Weibo posts retweeted tens of thousands of times.\n\nNearly all of China's tightly controlled state media outlets have covered the Liu vs Regan showdown, often framing the anchor as a symbol of Chinese toughness and rationality. Liu's employer CGTN -- the international division of China's all-powerful China Central Television network, or CCTV -- has hailed the clash between the two anchors as nothing less than a \"historic first.\"\n\nFrom the Chinese government perspective, the debate may be a small victory before Liu even utters a word on Fox Business. Over the past decade, the ruling Communist Party has invested heavily to push its state media into the global conversation and shape international discourse.\n\n\"Just think how many Americans see the Chinese narrative on CGTN versus how many will be viewing the debate on Fox,\" said Yuan Zeng, a lecturer at the University of Leeds School of Media and Communication. \"At least in terms of exposure, it's good for China.\"\n\nWhile many Western outlets have shrunk, Chinese organizations like CCTV and the Xinhua News Agency, once the key cogs of the domestic propaganda machinery, have turned their attention outward and expanded aggressively. The state organizations have spent millions on state-of-the-art hubs in New York, London, Cairo and Nairobi, where hundreds of its journalists work.\n\nNewspapers like the party-run People's Daily these days curate English-language feeds on Facebook and Twitter -- services banned inside China -- that share everything from Foreign Ministry statements to panda videos.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping, meanwhile, has demanded state media pledge \"absolute loyalty\" to the Communist Party and, above all else, \"tell China's story well\" to the outside world.\n\nNow with Chinese state media getting bigger and bolder -- so are its reporters.\n\nChen Weihua, the former chief Washington correspondent for party-owned China Daily, an influential English-language newspaper, said it was \"healthy\" that someone like Liu was going toe-to-toe with Regan. Unlike previous generations, Chen said, some Chinese state media reporters are increasingly happy to tangle with Western reporters, for instance on Twitter.\n\n\"The influence of Western media is disproportionate, and you can't avoid their overwhelming disinformation about China,\" said Chen, now China Daily's Brussels bureau chief. \"That's why China wants its news organizations well-represented so China's story is told by Chinese journalists, not by Western journalists.\"\n\nLiu and Regan first squared off two weeks ago, when Regan argued on her show that U.S. tariffs were a necessary response to China stealing $600 billion worth of technology. Liu then took direct aim at Regan on her talk show, \"The Point with Liu Xin,\" and criticized the Fox Business anchor's argument as \"all emotion\" and \"little substance.\"\n\nThe two exchanged more salvos on-air. They traded tweets. Regan invited Liu to debate. A date was set: May 29.\n\nRegan, who isn't exactly known for her adversarial stance toward the Trump administration, will face off Wednesday with a woman who is unapologetic about championing China.\n\n[China's newsrooms serve as President Xi's loyal mouthpieces]\n\nAn English major from eastern China who speaks flawless English, some French, German and Turkish, Liu became the first Chinese student to win an international public speaking competition in London in 1996. She joined CCTV after graduating and became one of its highest-profile correspondents, covering events like President Barack Obama's state visit to Beijing, the Iran nuclear talks and the conflict in Syria.\n\nLiu, who is married to German man of Turkish descent, said she spent 10 years telling \"the China story\" to her husband and children and found them swayed by negative Western media portrayals of her country.\n\n\"They respond by saying, 'oh, Mom is praising China again,'\" she told Thepaper.com in 2017. \"The same is true for my job: I need to lay out the facts and speak with reason. I want to win over the foreign audience.\"\n\nWhen she speaks to Chinese peers, Liu urges them to be more assertive and self-confident.\n\nLast January, Liu told Chinese reporters in Beijing that \"China has always been the subject of Western media criticism, often downright bashing based on falsehoods.\"\n\nThe country's economic rise reflected \"the validity and rationality of its development path, showing its confidence in its path, theories, institutions and culture,\" she said. \"It reinforces reporters' confidence in telling fantastic Chinese stories based on China's successful practices.\"\n\nLiu's profile is soaring at a time when her employer is increasingly scrutinized by the U.S. government -- precisely for its advocacy. Last year, the Justice Department ordered CCTV's U.S. division to register as an agent of foreign influence.\n\nZeng, from the University of Leeds, said events like Liu's debate could offer more proof to the network's critics.\n\n\"Everything about it is in line with serving the national interest and the party line,\" she said.\n\nParticularly as China's stature rose the last decade, some CCTV correspondents have embraced overt displays of nationalism.\n\nIn 2011, Rui Chenggang, a young CCTV star, famously asked the U.S. ambassador to Beijing, Gary Locke, if he flew economy because it was reminder that the United States owed China money.\n\nThis year, a CCTV London correspondent, Kong Linlin, was charged with assault by British police after she slapped a man twice at a political conference in a heated argument about China's role in Hong Kong.\n\nIf CCTV reporters are increasingly engaging their peers outside China, they've also taken occasional aim at Western correspondents at home.\n\nIn 2012, the veteran anchor Yang Rui celebrated China expelling an female American correspondent for Al Jazeera with a derogatory comment, saying those who demonize China should get lost. (Yang later apologized.)\n\nLast year, a CCTV reporter went on a lengthy on-air jeremiad criticizing the BBC's coverage of China's annual political conferences as inappropriate and unfair. Shortly after that, China's Foreign Ministry punished the British broadcaster by temporarily holding up visa renewals.\n\nThat reporter's name?

(Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nCritics and defenders of the National Security Agency faced off this weekend over a New York Times report detailing how hackers who locked up Baltimore's computer networks for the past two weeks relied partly on a leaked NSA hacking tool.\n\nThe tool, dubbed EternalBlue, has also been used to lock up city networks in San Antonio and Allentown, Pa., the Times's Nicole Perlroth and Scott Shane reported.\n\nCritics say the NSA is hellbent on developing dangerous hacking tools to use against adversaries and isn't adequately preparing for what happens when those tools leak and are used against U.S. targets.\n\nFrank Baitman, a former chief information officer at the Health and Human Services Department, compared the situation to biological weapons that make their way out of a U.S. government lab and infect citizens. The federal government, he tweeted, should shoulder some of the cost of Baltimore's ransomware attack and other such breaches using the leaked code.\n\nBaltimore City Council President Brandon M. Scott echoed that call and urged President Trump to declare a federal disaster, which could speed federal funding.\n\n\"Given the new information and circumstances it's even more clear that the federal government needs to have a larger role in supporting the city's recovery,\" he said in a statement.\n\nMany security researchers, however, say the real problem isn't with the NSA. They say that hacking victims like Baltimore still haven't taken sufficient measures against EternalBlue two years after it first leaked -- and aren't using a software patch released by Microsoft to to protect themselves\n\n\"If an organization has substantial numbers of Windows machines that have gone 2 years without patches, then that's squarely the fault of the organization, not Eternalblue,\" security researcher Robert Graham tweeted.\n\nRobert M. Lee, a former NSA hacker who's now CEO of the cybersecurity company Dragos, said the NSA deserves some blame for EternalBlue being stolen. But he added but that culpability shifts as more time elapses with victims not taking measures to protect themselves:\n\nIn the Baltimore case, EternalBlue wasn't the main element of the malware that permitted hackers to take control of the city's networks. But it allowed them to move more easily from system to system and to broaden the scope of the attack, the Times reported.\n\nAnd that's enough to cause alarm among some traditional defenders of the NSA.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.), whose district includes Fort Meade and part of Baltimore, are asking the NSA for a briefing on EternalBlue's role in the Baltimore attack, the Baltimore Sun's Ian Duncan and Kevin Rector reported.\n\nThe cybersecurity community has long battled over whether the U.S. government draws the right lines when it decides whether to alert companies about hackable vulnerabilities it finds in their software and hardware or to exploit those vulnerabilities to spy on foreign adversaries.\n\nThe Trump administration says it vets those computer bugs through a governmentwide process called a \"vulnerabilities equities review\" and alerts industry roughly 90 percent of the time. But critics point out the bugs government holds onto are usually the most damaging.\n\nThe debate has grown fiercer in recent years as leaks and breaches have exposed a trove of government hacking tools used by foreign intelligence agencies and criminal hackers.Those leaks have raised serious questions about whether the government is capable of keeping its covert hacking capabilities truly secret.\n\nThat includes the 2017 leak of NSA tools -- including EternalBlue -- by a hacking group called Shadow Brokers and a leak of CIA tools dubbed Vault 7 to WikiLeaks that same year. Officials have not publicly tied Shadow Brokers to any foreign government or other organization. The Justice Department charged a former CIA employee with the Vault 7 leak in 2018.\n\nEternalBlue was a component in the WannaCry ransomware that North Korea used in 2017, affecting more than 230,000 computers in 150 countries, and in the NotPetya attack launched by Russia the same year that wiped data from computers at banks, energy firms and government agencies.\n\nThomas Drake, a former NSA official and early whistleblower about the agency's warrantless phone and email surveillance programs, accused the NSA on Twitter of sacrificing the nation's security because of an \"obsession with offensively owning the 'net.' \"\n\nSome security researchers, however, say the NSA is being unfairly blamed for a proliferation of dangerous hacking tools that would have happened whether or not the agency's tools had leaked.\n\nIf those tools hadn't leaked, they say, hackers would just use other ones that are equally damaging.\n\nHere's a take from Beau Woods, founder of I am the Cavalry, a group that focuses on transparency and public safety in computer security:\n\nPINGED: The Chinese telecom giant Huawei, which the Trump administration is trying to oust from U.S. networks, has built much of its technological superiority by stealing from competitors, according to an extensive review of 10 legal cases by the Wall Street Journal's Chuin-Wei Yap, Dan Strumpf, Dustin Volz, Kate O'Keeffe and Aruna Wiswanatha.\n\n\"Huawei's accusers describe a wide-ranging, brazen, and opportunistic appetite: the targets of the alleged thefts range from longtime tech peers, including Cisco Technology Inc., and T-Mobile U.S. Inc., to a musician in Seattle barely making minimum wage in his day job,\" the authors report.\n\nThe conclusion, they write, is that \"Huawei had a corporate culture that blurred the boundary between competitive achievement and ethically dubious methods of pursuing it.\"\n\nOne \"alarm bell\" was \"the discovery around 2012 of secure rooms impenetrable to electronic eavesdropping built in Huawei's U.S. offices, akin to facilities in intelligence stations around the world, American security officials say.\"\n\nRobert Read, a contract engineer from 2002 to 2003 in Huawei's Swedish office, told the Journal: \"They spent all their resources stealing technology ... You'd steal a motherboard and bring it back and they'd reverse-engineer it.\"\n\nThe report comes after the Commerce Department barred U.S. companies from supplying Huawei with software and components over concerns it could aid Chinese spying. The State Department is also lobbying allies to bar Huawei from their next-generation 5G wireless networks.\n\nHuawei has steadfastly denied assisting Chinese spying or stealing technology. The company noted to the Journal that its research budget was $15.2 billion last year, among the highest in the world for global technology companies.\n\nPATCHED: First American Financial Corporation, a leading mortgage settlement company, left hundreds of millions of customer records exposed on the web, cybersecurity blogger Brian Krebs reported Friday.\n\nThe exposure of 885 million records relating to an unknown number of customers marks one of the largest such exposures in history.\n\nThere's no indication hackers stole any of the records, which include Social Security numbers, bank account numbers and other personal information, Krebs reported.\n\nBut stealing records would have been relatively easy and \"the information exposed by First American would be a virtual gold mine for phishers and scammers,\" Krebs reported.\n\n\"Based on a tip from a real estate developer who found the vulnerability, Krebs wrote that anybody with access to a Web portal for the company could have gained access to documents from other customers by altering digits in the Web address,\" my colleagues Craig Timberg and Renae Merle explained.\n\nFirst American acknowledged the exposure in a statement to Krebs and said it had shut down access to the vulnerable site.

Swanson, global-policy director at the Telecommunications Industry Association, a trade group representing telecom-equipment makers that do business in the U.S. She said higher costs could lead carriers to charge customers more for wireless plans, making 5G less attractive for consumers.\n\nCommerce Department representatives didn't respond to a request for comment over the weekend.\n\nThe potential impact on U.S. carriers and consumers shows how globally entwined the internet and telecom sectors are, despite the competition to roll out 5G. \"When there are disturbances in the supply chain, it'll impact the whole industry,\" said Bengt Nordstr\u00f6m, who runs Northstream, a consulting firm that helps wireless carriers buy equipment.\n\nPresident Trump has said the U.S. must win the 5G race by becoming the first major nation to set up a wireless network using the new technology. U.S. officials say 5G, which promises to zap gobs of data around networks much faster than today's systems do, will provide the infrastructure for futuristic commercial and military inventions: driverless cars, flying battlefield drones, automated factories and web-connected pacemakers.\n\nThat potential -- and Huawei's prominence -- worries U.S. officials, who have essentially banned Chinese equipment from U.S. wireless networks since 2012. Huawei is the world's biggest telecom-equipment company and holds more patents for 5G standards than any other company. U.S. officials say Beijing could order Huawei to tap into the hardware or software it makes to spy or take control of internet-connected objects. Huawei and the Chinese government say such a thing would never happen.\n\nThe Commerce Department order earlier this month made it difficult for U.S. suppliers to sell components to Huawei, though some companies have a temporary exemption. If those suppliers lose a chunk of revenue from Huawei, they might have to slow operations to stay profitable.\n\nIf suppliers slow operations, the Western companies that also buy from such suppliers might face a components shortage. \"It's not like the suppliers can instantly swap customers,\" said Mr. Nordstr\u00f6m, the consultant and a former Ericsson AB executive.\n\nAn official at one Silicon Valley supplier of Huawei said a slowdown in its manufacturing was possible and could result in short-term revenue losses. But the supplier expects rival telecom-equipment makers, such as Cisco, Finland's Nokia Corp. , Sweden's Ericsson or even China's ZTE Corp , which currently doesn't face the same Commerce Department restrictions, to step up purchases of popular components that Huawei can't buy.\n\nThe Western industry executives say Huawei rivals are positioned to buy more components from affected suppliers and don't expect major disruptions.\n\nWhile U.S. officials consider the actions against Huawei a national-security matter, the U.S.-China trade feud is already making the American 5G rollout more expensive. Earlier this month, Washington raised from 10% to 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, including major telecom equipment.\n\nEarlier this month, executives at Cisco, a giant maker of routers and switches, said they have shifted some, but not all, manufacturing out of China since last summer, when the 10% tariffs were introduced. Chief Executive Chuck Robbins said that after the tariffs went up to 25%, the company raised prices for some products.\n\nRepresentatives for all four major U.S. carriers -- AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. -- declined to comment for this article.\n\nWashington's campaign might give China's 5G rollout bigger challenges, the industry executives and analysts say. China's three major state-owned telecom providers get at least 70% of their equipment from Huawei and ZTE, the executives said.\n\nA U.S. Chamber of Commerce analysis of a Chinese government plan to upgrade industries said Beijing set a 2020 goal of having 75% of its mobile-systems equipment produced domestically.\n\nHuawei founder Ren Zhengfei said in an interview last week with Chinese media that the company had expected such obstacles from Washington and was prepared. Huawei had previously said it had stockpiled components for such a scenario.\n\n\"Even if Huawei has stockpiled critical components, these will run out,\" said Bernstein analyst Chris Lane, \"and they are unlikely to be able to develop substitutes for all of these in a one-year time frame.\"\n\nChina's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which oversees telecommunications in the country, didn't respond to a request for comment. Neither did China Mobile Ltd. , a state-owned enterprise that is the largest wireless carrier by subscribers in the world. Another state-owned carrier, China Telecommunications Group Corp., said in a written statement that it buys from both domestic and foreign telecom-equipment manufacturers and \"will pay close attention to the development of the situation.\"\n\n-- Sarah Krouse and Drew FitzGerald contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com", "source": {"uri": "wsj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-77234/social", "eventUri": "eng-4813103", "sentiment": null, "wgt": 296733600}, {"uri": "1147280097", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-28", "time": "10:00:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-28T10:00:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cable-answers-cord-cutters-with-half-price-cellphone-service-11559035800", "title": "Cable Answers Cord-Cutters With Half-Price Cellphone Service", "body": "Altice plans cellphone service costing $20-$30 as cable providers undercut wireless carriers, try to keep customers By Sarah Krouse and Sarah Krouse The Wall Street Journal BiographySarah Krouse @bysarahkrouse sarah.krouse@wsj.com Lillian Rizzo Lillian Rizzo The Wall Street Journal BiographyLillian Rizzo @Lilliannnn May 28, 2019 5:30 a.m. ET\n\nA new player is about to enter the crowded U.S. wireless market, pitching monthly unlimited data that costs half as much as rivals.\n\nThe catch? It is a cable-television company.\n\nAltice USA Inc. ATUS -0.37% is preparing to launch a mobile service likely to cost between $20 and $30 a phone, according to people familiar with the matter. This summer it will join rivals Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. in trying to persuade Americans to get their wireless service from their cable providers by promising lower prices.\n\nThe new service, likely to be called Altice Mobile, will run on Sprint S 3.02% Corp.'s mobile network and relies on customers' in-home Wi-Fi and the company's network of hot spots throughout the urban markets it serves, including New York City. The company plans to test the service with its employees in the coming weeks, the people said.\n\nAltice, which has 3.3 million TV subscribers and 4.1 million internet customers, has recently said the company is on track to launch its mobile service this summer. A spokeswoman said pricing isn't set and the \"go-to-market plans are still in development.\"\n\nCable providers are hoping wireless service will make their existing customers less likely to cut the cord and generate additional revenue. Wireless carriers like Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc., meanwhile, are betting the advent of faster, 5G networks will enable them to offer wireless broadband inside homes that sidelines cable companies.\n\nComcast, the biggest cable-TV provider, began selling its Xfinity Mobile service in 2017, and Charter launched its Spectrum Mobile last September. The wireless services are only available to customers who also pay for home broadband.\n\nBoth Comcast and Charter charge $45 a month per line for unlimited monthly data. The two also allow their customers to pay for only the data they use, between $12 and $14 per gigabyte.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nWho Needs Google's Android? Huawei Trademarks Its Own Smartphone OS (May 24)\n\nComcast said it has signed up 1.4 million subscribers to its mobile service as of the end of March, compared with 577,000 a year earlier. The majority of its customers are on plans in which they pay per gigabyte. Charter said it had 310,000 mobile customers as of late March.\n\nUnlimited monthly plans for a single phone start at $80 at Verizon and $70 at AT&T, which also gives discounts to its DirecTV subscribers. Both carriers have more than 100 million wireless connections.\n\nComcast and Charter have added cellphone customers even as the four largest wireless carriers compete for subscribers in the saturated U.S. market. Those consumers, however, have proved data hungry, which can drive up the cost of providing the service. Both cable companies rent Verizon's wireless network and typically pay based on customer usage.\n\nCharter said at an analyst conference in May that it was exploring building its own small cell antennas to boost its network of Wi-Fi hot spots, which would allow it to unload some traffic in areas with heavy data demands and help it save on costs.\n\nEven though the costs of providing mobile service may be high, the cable companies profit in retention and growth of scale, said Moody's Investors Service analyst Neil Begley.\n\nAltice has bolstered its Wi-Fi network in advance of its new service and aims to push some mobile traffic onto those hot spots when consumers are away from home, reducing the amount of cellular data they use. That, in turn, reduces what the cable company must pay Sprint.\n\nAs part of the arrangement, the broadband provider controls its customers' wireless traffic and billing, and Sprint is able to build out its own network within Altice's footprint.\n\nOn May 20, Altice secured commitments from T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint that if their merger is approved, the combined company won't terminate its relationship with Altice. The wireless firms also promised to make good-faith efforts to expand the agreement to include their combined 5G network.\n\nCharter and Comcast have said that even though their services are new, there are signs that selling mobile service helps reduce customer defections and increase the number of products bought.\n\n\"If you're able to save customers $800 a year on their mobile bill and you add that into their existing cable service, then I think that you're going to have a happier customer relationship at the end of the day,\" said Christopher Winfrey, Charter's chief financial officer, at an analyst conference in May. Advertising those potential cellphone savings also can help attract new broadband customers, he added.\n\nCharter, which has 16 million cable TV subscribers, only recently started to allow customers to bring their own phones rather than requiring them to buy a device from the company, a change it expects will attract more customers.\n\nDavid Watson, chief executive of Comcast Cable, said during a recent earnings call that the company is \"seeing some improvement in retention and that's exactly what one of our top goals were.\"\n\nA spokesman for Cox Communications, another cable provider that has offered mobile phone service at times over the past decade, said the company continues to explore launching wireless service in the future but has no immediate plans to do so.\n\n\"We have built out extensive Wi-Fi capabilities through infrastructure investment and industry partnerships,\" he said, pointing to Cox's investment in InSite Wireless Group LLC, which constructs and operates communications tower sites.\n\nWrite to Sarah Krouse at sarah.krouse@wsj.com and Lillian Rizzo at Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com", "source": {"uri": "wsj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-77033/social", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": null, "wgt": 296733600}, {"uri": "1146910868", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-27", "time": "21:42:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-27T21:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5176470875740051, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/27/us/politics/us-huawei-berlin-wall.html", "title": "Trump Wants to Wall Off Huawei, but the Digital World Bridles at Barriers", "body": "President Trump has finally succeeded in building his wall: not the one he keeps demanding on the southwestern border, but a far more complex barrier meant to block China's national telecommunications champion, Huawei, from operating in the United States and starve it of American technology as it builds networks around the globe.\n\nAfter a flurry of new government edicts, Huawei, the world's second-largest cellphone maker after it edged out Apple last year, will soon be entirely cut off from American-made technology. By the end of summer, new Huawei phones will come without Google apps. And American computer chip companies are cutting off supplies that Huawei depends on for building fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless networks.\n\nBut the fight is about far more than merely crippling one Chinese telecom giant. Mr. Trump and his aides want to force nations to make an agonizing choice: Which side of a new Berlin Wall do they want to live on?\n\nWashington is portraying this in Cold War terms, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arguing that world leaders will have to choose between an internet that projects \"Western values,\" including the free, if chaotic, abuse-prone cyberspace Americans have, and one \"based on the principles of an authoritarian, Communist regime.\"\n\nYet it is hardly that simple. The jagged divide built across Berlin in the summer of 1961 was nearly impermeable; it stopped virtually all commerce and human contact between the East and West parts of the city -- and became a symbol of how two adversary camps sought to isolate each other. But even if Mr. Trump is successful in isolating Huawei, billions of bits of data will flow through undersea fiber-optic lines -- many of which its subsidiary Huawei Marine is laying -- and through satellites connecting the two competing internet environments.\n\nIn public and private statements, American intelligence officials and telecommunications executives and experts have begun to concede that the United States will be operating in a world where Huawei and other Chinese telecom companies most likely control 40 to 60 percent of the networks over which businesses, diplomats, spies and citizens do business.\n\n\"You have to presume a dirty network,\" Sue Gordon, the deputy director of national intelligence, said recently at a national security conference in Texas. \"We are going to have to figure out a way in a 5G world that we're able to manage the risks in a diverse network that includes technology that we can't trust. \"\n\nHer meaning was clear. Despite the president's repeated insistence that \"America must win,\" his own aides are struggling to explain what winning looks like around the world. Is a divided internet a victory? Could it even work?\n\n\"We're just going to have to figure that out,\" Ms. Gordon said.\n\nSo far, despite threats from the United States that any allies that side with Huawei and China will be cut off from American intelligence, many are trying desperately to straddle the wall.\n\nAmong the United States' closest allies, only Australia has banned Huawei from building its new networks; Japan has effectively done the same. Britain and Germany, two of the most powerful members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, are hedging. Their politicians fear the job losses that would result as well as Chinese retaliation, and they believe there are elements of the network that Huawei could build without endangering national security.\n\nUnder that plan, Nokia, Ericsson or other Western telecom firms would build the \"core\" of the network, the software-heavy switching systems that govern how machines and humans will talk to one another. Huawei would be relegated to the more peripheral parts of the networks, like the cellular tower systems that communicate with phones and other devices.\n\nGermany has resisted the Trump administration's entreaties. German officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss their internal debates, say they wonder what would happen if they sided with the United States, which helped rebuild their country after World War II and keeps it under the American nuclear umbrella. Would Beijing threaten the joint ventures that produce roughly a million BMW and Mercedes-Benz automobiles in China? And in Singapore, where American ships pull in for fueling and maintenance on their way to the disputed areas of the South China Sea, officials say privately that there is no way they will ban Huawei.\n\nThis may explain why Mr. Pompeo, who has led the charge, has sounded more strident in recent days, describing the decisions made by nations that will build their networks over the next 12 to 18 months as a question not only of national security but of ideological struggle.\n\n\"The company is deeply tied not only to China but to the Chinese Communist Party, and that connectivity, the existence of those connections, puts American information that crosses the networks at risk,\" Mr. Pompeo said last week in an interview with CNBC.\n\n\"We need a single place where information can be exchanged,\" he told one of the interviewers, \"but it has to be a system that has Western values embedded in it, with rule of law, property right protections, transparency, openness. It can't be a system that is based on the principles of an authoritarian, Communist regime.\"\n\nBut intelligence officials give a somewhat different explanation of their concerns. They are far less worried about China's stealing data that moves across American networks than they are about the possibility that, in times of conflict, the Chinese authorities would order Huawei or other Chinese telecom firms to shut the networks down.\n\nTheir thinking is that much of the most sensitive information that moves across those networks -- including military communications and financial data -- is already encrypted. And unencrypted data is already at risk: About a decade ago, Chinese hackers stole the plans for the F-35 fighter jet, and in 2014, the security clearance information of over 22 million Americans was taken from the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nSo at the core of the American concern is that over time, China's domination of the switching systems and the undersea cables that carry data will present a huge vulnerability that most Americans never think about. Rob Joyce, a former White House cybersecurity coordinator who once led the unit in the National Security Agency that breaks into foreign computer systems, distinguished between the threats posed by President Vladimir V. Putin's Russia and President Xi Jinping's China.\n\n\"Russia is a hurricane\" threatening to disrupt American power grids or communications systems, Mr. Joyce said at a conference held in March by The Cipher Brief, an online intelligence newsletter. \"China is climate science,\" gradually altering the environment in its favor by building the networks on which the world depends, he added.\n\nHuawei has argued that all of this is fear mongering. In a series of carefully managed interviews with Chinese reporters and some American news outlets, the company's founder, Ren Zhengfei, has insisted that he would refuse any Chinese government effort to peer into American communications or shut down networks. American officials counter that under Chinese law, Mr. Ren would have no choice but to comply.\n\nBut his interviews point to a greater danger in the crackdown that Mr. Trump has never acknowledged: Halting the flow of American technology to China, or even only threatening to do so, is bound to speed up China's move toward technological independence.\n\nThe country is already four years into the Made in China 2025 movement, a government policy to make domestic manufacturers dominant in critical high-technology fields like semiconductor manufacturing, 5G technology, artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles. (China consumes 60 percent of the world's supply of semiconductors but makes only 13 percent, a recent Council on Foreign Relations report notes.)\n\nMade in China 2025 was based in part on a fear that this day would come -- that the United States, feeling vulnerable, would threaten to cut off Chinese competitors.\n\nMr. Ren, in an interview with Chinese reporters last week, made clear that he had begun stockpiling key components, and accelerated the process after his daughter was arrested in December in Canada on American charges that Huawei had violated sanctions on Iran.\n\n\"We have prepared,\" he said, adding, \"What the U.S. will do to us is out of our control.\" But he made the case that any disruptions to Huawei would be temporary.\n\n\"Even if there is an insufficient supply from our partners, we will face no problems,\" Mr. Ren said. \"This is because we can manufacture all the high-end chips we need ourselves. In the 'peaceful period,' we adopted a '1 plus 1' policy: Half of our chips come from U.S. companies and half from Huawei.\"\n\nSome of that may be bluster. But Mr. Ren's larger point is correct, many who study the issue say.\n\n\"We're not thinking about the way that this will boomerang when we are dealing with a China that is much more self-reliant, much larger and much less dependent on the U.S.,\" said Ali Wyne, a policy analyst at the RAND Corporation. \"We need to be careful what we wish for.\"\n\nThat is exactly the fear of the Europeans, especially middle-size nations that value their trading relationships with Beijing as much as they value their military alliances with the United States. Increasingly doubtful that America would go to their aid in times of crisis, they are keeping a foot in both camps. And even NATO allies, like Italy and Poland, doubt the United States would carry out its threat to cut them off.\n\n\"What they are saying to Washington,\" Mr. Wyne said, is \"no, thank you, we won't make a choice.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_e_sanger@nytimes.com", "name": "David E.

By Song Liuping May 27, 2019 4:33 p.m. ET\n\nThe British Parliament once levied sentences against purported conspirators seeking to overthrow the crown. As a result, the U.S. Constitution prohibits Congress from passing any \"bill of attainder\" -- a law punishing a person or group without a trial.\n\nLawmakers last summer enacted a bill of attainder targeting Huawei, a successful, privately owned and operated Chinese technology company. The 2019 National Defense Authorization Act places a broad ban on certain Huawei equipment: Federal agencies may not procure it, federal contractors may not use it, and federal loan and grant recipients may not use government funds to buy it.\n\nThe law applies to other companies if the defense secretary \"reasonably believes\" -- subject to judicial review -- that they are \"owned or controlled\" by, or \"otherwise connected to,\" the Chinese government. But it directly and permanently applies to Huawei without opportunity for rebuttal or escape.\n\nHuawei has sued and on Tuesday will file a motion for summary judgment asking the court to declare the law unconstitutional. The ban is a quintessential bill of attainder and a violation of due process. Its congressional sponsors promoted it as a punishment both for alleged prior misdeeds and unsubstantiated allegations that the company is associated with the Chinese government -- all of which Huawei vigorously denies.\n\nMoreover, the law provides Huawei with no opportunity to rebut the accusations, to present evidence in its defense, or to avail itself of other procedures that impartial adjudicators provide to ensure a fair search for the truth. Rather, the law simply pronounces Huawei's guilt and imposes vast restrictions with the express purpose of driving Huawei out of the U.S. market. This is the tyranny of \"trial by legislature\" that the U.S. Constitution prohibits.\n\nEven if it were constitutional, the law would do little to advance national security or strengthen the security of government information networks. It does not address the alleged global-supply chain risks from equipment that uses Chinese components or software; it merely targets Huawei. It doesn't even prevent federal agencies from continuing to use Huawei equipment; it merely prohibits new purchases. And it imposes no restriction on the use of equipment manufactured by the Chinese government's joint ventures with other major telecommunications companies.\n\nAt the same time, the 2019 NDAA perversely undermines the technological and economic interests of the United States. Huawei is the world's leading innovator in network switching equipment, including 5G. Impeding Huawei's ability to sell equipment in the U.S. reduces competition, thereby raising prices and constraining access to internet services, particularly in rural and remote parts of the U.S., where Huawei's competitors have chosen not to do business.\n\nOther governments around the world understand that Huawei is not a tool of the Chinese government, and that the company wants to work to improve cybersecurity and provide the best technologies at affordable prices. These other governments are moving forward with Huawei, while the U.S. is not. The American people's best hope may lie in the rule of law -- that U.S. courts, as they have done with prior bills of attainder and violations of due process, will declare the Huawei ban unconstitutional and prohibit its enforcement.\n\nMr. Song is chief legal officer at Huawei Technologies.", "source": {"uri": "wsj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-77206/social", "eventUri": "eng-4813103", "sentiment": null, "wgt": 296687340}, {"uri": "1145157607", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-25", "time": "09:05:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-25T09:05:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/25/technology/huawei-rural-wireless-service.html", "title": "Huawei Ban Threatens Wireless Service in Rural Areas", "body": "OPHEIM, Mont. -- Kevin Nelson was recently in the middle of his 3,800-acre farm in northeast Montana, where the landscape stretches out like an ocean, when his tractor broke. He tried to find a cellular signal strong enough to send a photo of the broken part to a repair shop 65 miles away, but failed.\n\n\"It's really frustrating,\" Mr. Nelson, 47, said about the poor reception. \"We keep being told it's going to improve, it's going to improve.\"\n\nNow it's not likely to improve anytime soon.\n\nPlans to upgrade the wireless service near Mr. Nelson's farm halted abruptly this month when President Trump issued an executive order that banned the purchase of equipment from companies posing a national security threat. That includes gear from Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, a major supplier of equipment to rural wireless companies.\n\nThe chief executive of the wireless provider in Mr. Nelson's area said that without access to inexpensive Huawei products, his company could not afford to build a planned tower that would serve Mr. Nelson's farm.\n\nThe Trump administration's ban, its latest move against the company, rippled through the telecommunications industry. Wireless carriers in several countries, including Britain and Japan, said they would no longer sell the company's phones. Google said it would stop providing its Android operating software in new Huawei smartphones, which are popular in Europe and Asia.\n\nBut perhaps nowhere will the changes be felt more acutely than in rural America, where wireless service is spotty despite yearslong government efforts to improve coverage. They also add to the economic uncertainty created by the White House's trade war with China. Farmers are fearful of an extended hit to their exports.\n\nHuawei is essential for many wireless carriers that serve sprawling, sparsely populated regions because its gear for transmitting cell signals often costs far less than other options.\n\nThe president's ban is forcing carriers like Nemont, which serves Opheim, to scrap expansion plans. In addition, some of the companies already using Huawei equipment fear that they will no longer receive government subsidies meant to help get service to remote areas.\n\nJoseph Franell, the chief executive of Eastern Oregon Telecom, a small carrier that relies on Huawei products, said he was being forced to rethink his business.\n\n\"The reason why we are able to serve our customers is because we are mindful of costs,\" he said. \"We don't go out and buy a Lamborghini when you can buy a Ford pickup.\"\n\nWhile Huawei sells many types of technology, including smartphones, the vast majority of its revenue comes from sales of equipment that moves data through networks and to devices. Only a few other companies, like Nokia and Ericsson, both based in Europe, sell comparable gear.\n\nAmerican intelligence officials have accused Huawei of being an extension of the Chinese government, and say its equipment could be vulnerable to espionage and hacking. Mr. Trump also appears to be using Huawei as a bargaining chip in his escalating trade battle with China.\n\n\"Huawei is something that is very dangerous,\" the president said on Thursday. \"It's possible that Huawei would be included in some kind of trade deal.\"\n\nHuawei denies that it is a security risk, saying it is an independent business that does not act on behalf of the Chinese government. It says 500 carriers in more than 170 nations use its technology.\n\n\"Restricting Huawei from doing business in the U.S. will not make the U.S. more secure or stronger,\" Huawei said in a statement. \"Instead, this will only serve to limit the U.S. to inferior yet more expensive alternatives.\"\n\nMuch of Mr. Trump's focus has been on the next generation of wireless technology, known as 5G. But Huawei already provides equipment to about a quarter of the country's smallest wireless carriers. The Rural Wireless Association, a trade group that represents 55 small carriers, estimates that it would cost its members $800 million to $1 billion to replace equipment from Huawei and ZTE, China's other maker of networking gear.\n\nNemont, based near Opheim, is one of those companies. Its footprint is 14,000 square miles, bigger than Maryland, and requires huge amounts of wires, towers and other costly infrastructure. But the company has only 11,000 paying customers.\n\nNemont first reached out to Huawei nine years ago, when its members decided to upgrade their cellular network. With subsidies from the federal government, Nemont was prepared to spend about $4 million on networking equipment like routers and other gear to put on dozens of cell towers across the region.\n\nEven at the time, officials in the Obama administration voiced concerns about Chinese equipment makers and their ability to break into American networks to steal intellectual property or hack into corporate or government networks. Defense Department officials and lawmakers said they were concerned that the Chinese government and military could use the equipment to intercept American communications.\n\nThe officials were vague about their concerns over Huawei, then a little-known firm. But Mike Kilgore, the chief executive of Nemont, said he had outlined Nemont's plans to buy Huawei equipment in a letter to Senator Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, and asked whether Mr. Tester had security concerns.\n\nMr. Kilgore said he was ready to go another route if Huawei's equipment would put customers at risk. \"I was begging for them to say, 'No, don't buy it,'\" he said.\n\nMr. Tester's office called him and said it didn't see any major concerns with picking Huawei, Mr. Kilgore said. A spokesman for Mr. Tester said an aide had told Mr. Kilgore to contact the F.B.I. and other intelligence officials for advice.\n\nAfter the call, Mr. Kilgore chose Huawei, which offered to customize its equipment and charge 20 to 30 percent less than competitors.\n\nNemont has since expanded its high-speed wireless network using almost all Huawei equipment. Mr. Kilgore even visited Huawei's headquarters in Shenzhen. He is the president of the Rural Wireless Association, the trade group. Huawei has a representative on the group's board without voting rights, one of two board members who don't represent a wireless carrier.\n\n\"The other vendors hardly gave us the time of day, and now they have been acquired or are out of business,\" Mr. Kilgore said. \"We took a gamble, but we clearly made the right bet.\"\n\nThe technological upgrade changed lives. Kevin Rasmussen was recently in the cab of his tractor using an iPad connected to high-speed internet beaming from a nearby cell tower. The connection worked with software on the iPad to help direct where the tractor poked holes in the soil and dropped seeds and fertilizer.\n\n\"I can sit up here in my tractor and do my banking, monitor six weather apps and read up on things like trade and Huawei, all on my phone,\" Mr. Rasmussen said. \"Rural America needs this so badly.\"\n\nNemont had plans to extend that high-speed service. It had leased land in Opheim for a new cell tower that would have delivered a strong signal. That is the tower that would have improved the service on Mr. Nelson's farm.\n\nBut the company tabled those plans after Mr. Trump's executive order.\n\n\"We have no idea what we are going to be able to do,\" Mr. Kilgore said. \"I'm not getting sleep at night.\"\n\nMany companies that extend wireless broadband to rural areas, like Nemont, depend on subsidies from the Federal Communications Commission. But Ajit Pai, the commission's chairman, has proposed cutting off that money to carriers using equipment from Huawei or ZTE.\n\n\"We believe that it is important that networks are secure not just in urban areas, but in rural areas as well,\" the agency said in a statement. \"There are currently many rural broadband providers that use equipment that does not pose a national security risk.\"\n\nMr. Kilgore estimated that it would cost $50 million to replace his Huawei equipment. If that is the only option, he said, he might have to shut down the company, leaving his customers without wireless service.\n\nMr. Rasmussen said that would be a big blow to his farming operation.\n\n\"We're getting squeezed on all sides,\" he said. \"The tariffs and trade affect our prices, and now this could affect our ability to farm.\"\n\nMr. Kilgore has argued, through his work with the Rural Wireless Association, for an exemption to the F.C.C. rule for small rural carriers, or for subsidies to replace the Huawei equipment. A bipartisan group senators recently introduced a bill that would set aside about $700 million in grants to carriers forced to rip Huawei equipment from their networks.\n\nMr. Kilgore got another glimmer of hope, too. On Monday, he got an email saying Brendan Carr, an F.C.C. commissioner, was heading out to Montana. They will get together in the next week.\n\n\"This is a big day,\" Mr. Kilgore said after getting the email. \"It's not every day someone from Washington comes to visit.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cecilia_kang@nytimes.com", "name": "Cecilia Kang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/23/business/00rural1-sub/00rural1-sub-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4809152", "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 296471100}, {"uri": "1144545454", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-24", "time": "13:18:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-24T13:18:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5215686559677124, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2019/05/24/daily-202-trump-keeps-trying-to-pick-winners-and-losers-from-the-bailout-for-farmers-to-a-border-wall-contract/5ce6cad11ad2e52231e8e79a/", "title": "The Daily 202: Trump keeps trying to pick winners and losers - from the bailout for farmers to a border wall contract", "body": "THE BIG IDEA: President Trump fancies himself a hands-on leader. One consequence is that his economic policy is guided less by the invisible hand of the free market than the heavy hand of the central government.\n\nThe president continued his pattern of picking winners and losers on Thursday afternoon when he unveiled a $16 billion bailout to help farmers offset losses from the trade war he started, and which he continues to escalate, with China. This is on top of the $12 billion in emergency cash he made available last July.\n\nThe substance of Trump's announcement at the White House, in which he was flanked by more than a dozen farmers, was entirely overshadowed by his own theatrics. Angry that Speaker Nancy Pelosi claimed he threw a \"temper tantrum,\" the president told reporters: \"I'm an extremely stable genius, okay?\" Standing in front of the press corps, Trump asked five of his aides to tell everyone how \"very calm\" he had been when he walked out of a meeting the day before. \"You were very calm,\" replied Larry Kudlow, the president's top economic adviser.\n\nThe new bailout Trump introduced is significant and merits scrutiny. Make no mistake, these are government handouts. And few conservatives who purport to support free markets are objecting.\n\nThe politics are a no-brainer. Trump cannot win reelection without the farm belt. He narrowly prevailed in 2016 because of overwhelming strength in rural areas that depend on agriculture. Indeed, the Chinese have targeted farmers to cause political pain for the president so that he'll cave in negotiations. As soon as Trump slapped tariffs of 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports, Beijing retaliated with import taxes on U.S. agricultural commodities such as soybeans, which tend to be grown in places the president is depending on in 2020.\n\nTrump began his 47-minute appearance in the Roosevelt Room by noting that farmers have supported him. He said it was a \"great honor to be here with ... people that have been with me from the beginning.\" \"They're patriots. They stood up and they were with me,\" the president said. \"I'm very honored to have done this for you.\"\n\nThe long riff that followed underscored the degree to which Trump sees the presidency as transactional. He seems to think he deserves credit for making the government cut checks to save farmers after pursuing policies that have pushed them toward insolvency. Never mind that there would be no need for this bailout if he hadn't picked a fight with not just China but also allies like Mexico, Canada and Europe. It's been 15 months now since Trump declared that \"trade wars are good, and easy to win.\" He tweeted that the morning after announcing a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum.\n\nIn his remarks, Trump suggested that this trade war could drag on for a very long time. \"I remain hopeful that, at some point, we'll probably get together with China,\" he said. \"If it happens, great. If it doesn't happen, that's fine. That's absolutely fine.\"\n\nTrump proceeded to tout initiatives he's taken to help corn growers. He noted that he directed the EPA to make it easier to sell more ethanol in vehicle fuel, lifting summertime fueling restrictions on E15 gasoline, which means it contains as much as 15 percent ethanol. Iowa is the nation's top producer of both ethanol and corn. Most economists can explain to you why this is shortsighted economic policy, not to mention deleterious for the environment. \"The people in Iowa, and lots of other places, are very happy,\" he declared yesterday afternoon. \"I made a promise during the campaign that I was going to do it. I don't know if it had an impact, but I won Iowa by a lot.\"\n\n-- Not everyone is getting government handouts. The brewers, for instance, haven't received any bailout. America's beer industry yesterday blamed the Trump tariffs for the loss of 40,000 jobs. Metal tariffs imposed by Trump have boosted the cost of aluminum cans, leading to declines in investment, a new report by two trade groups showed, per Bloomberg News.\n\n-- Bigger picture, Trump has pursued something that at times feels akin to a 1950s-style national industrial policy. He's tried to revive steelmakers and domestic manufacturers with tariffs. He's vetoed foreign investments. He's publicly pressuring the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. He has used the bully pulpit of the presidency to attack individual companies, and even corporate executives, by name. Among other things, Trump went after Nordstrom's for dropping his daughter Ivanka's clothing line.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin disclosed during congressional testimony on Wednesday that he's personally been haggling with corporate executives about prices. He said he spoke with the chief financial officer of Walmart after the company warned that customers will need to pay more for furniture and other goods because of the Trump tariffs. To put it mildly, this has not historically been the role of the treasury secretary. At least in America.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has been given immense power over whether to grant waivers to exempt companies from tariffs. This gives government the ability to favor some companies and industries and punish others.\n\n-- It's Economics 101: Central planning like this has never worked in the long run because it distorts incentives, and no bureaucrat setting prices in Washington can outsmart markets. Cliometricians can debate until the cows come home, but the free market -- as much as anything else -- is why we won the Cold War. The Soviets just couldn't keep up.\n\n\"Trump's snap decision to send billions of dollars in new aid to farmers could be bad for the farm economy and the federal budget,\" Politico food and agriculture reporter Catherine Boudreau reports. \"Many farmers are still deciding what to plant this spring and could be swayed toward crops that receive higher payouts from the aid package, such as soybeans. That would add to already record supplies and further depress prices that have been falling for five years. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who weeks earlier denied the White House was discussing another round of aid so soon after a $12 billion bailout last year, suddenly interrupted a trip to South Korea to announce a second program.\n\n\"Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, told reporters Wednesday that the White House should have been more cautious about the timing of the announcement because farmers are still planting. 'We want farmers to make decisions on how many acres of corn and soybeans to plant based on the market and not something the government's doing,' he said. ... Rainfall in the Midwest has delayed planting, so many farmers can still switch up their crops. Even the prospect of another round of trade assistance could encourage them to plant more soybeans.\"\n\n-- \"The new relief plan aims to avoid problems that arose in the first aid package, when soybeans received what many believed was a disproportionate amount of the money, while corn received only a penny a bushel. Other producers were shut out entirely from relief payments,\" Laura Reiley, Colby Itkowitz and Annie Gowen report. \"The bulk of the payments will be set aside for row crops such as alfalfa, wheat and oats, which will be paid at a single rate according to the number of acres planted in each county. More niche crops, including tree nuts, sweet cherries, cranberries and grapes, will also be eligible for relief, depending on tariff impacts. Dairy and pork producers also stand to receive relief under the system. Distributing relief funds by-county, and not by commodity, will hopefully discourage farmers from planting crops that would be more lucrative in aid money.\"\n\n-- But the Trump bailouts are often not going to the farmers who need them the most. Jeff Stein reported last November about some of the people who got money from the first, $12 billion round of bailouts: \"Scott Yocom is a 48-year-old architect who lives in Manhattan, works at an office building near Times Square, and has been recently consumed with designing a new central terminal at LaGuardia Airport in Queens. But late last month, Yocom received a government check worth about $3,300, a payment that came courtesy of a Trump administration program aimed at helping farmers hurt by the U.S.-China trade war. Yocom said he spends two weeks a year on his family farm in Ohio, but as a part-owner he was eligible for the bailout funds. Yocom was one of at least 1,100 residents of the 50 largest U.S. cities who has received bailout funds from the Agriculture Department, according to USDA data.\"\n\nConsider this story published last week by the New York Daily News: \"The Trump administration has forked over more than $62 million -- taxpayer cash that was supposed to be earmarked for struggling American farmers -- to a massive meatpacking company owned by a couple of corrupt Brazilian brothers. The Department of Agriculture cut a contract in January to purchase $22.3 million worth of pork from plants operated by JBS USA, a Colorado-based subsidiary of Brazil's JBS SA, which ranks as the largest meatpacker in the world. ... Previously undisclosed purchase reports ... reveal the administration has since issued at least two more bailouts to JBS, even as Trump's own Justice Department began investigating the meatpacker, whose owners are Joesley and Wesley Batista -- two wealthy brothers who have confessed to bribing hundreds of top officials in Brazil. Both brothers have spent time in jail over the sweeping corruption scandal.\"\n\n-- Despite these and many other problems so far, most conservatives on Capitol Hill were more muted in their response to the second round of agriculture bailouts than the first. It's another proof point of the degree to which Trump's takeover of the GOP has made the party more protectionist, even mercantilist, in its outlook. \"Last year, some Republican senators were incensed by such a move, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) compared it to 'golden crutches' aimed at 'making it 1929 again' and then Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) questioned why 'there isn't an outright revolt in Congress right now,'\" Jackie Alemany notes this morning. \"But Corker retired and Sasse is running for reelection, plus other Republican senators view the decision to go after China as worthwhile even if it means an economic gut punch for farmers and other industries in the interim.\" Sasse did not release a statement yesterday.\n\nFOLLOW THE MONEY:\n\n-- Trump is breaking with norms and pushing military decision-makers who are supposed to be immune to political considerations to give a massive contract to a specific firm. This is the most jaw-dropping story you'll read today:\n\n\"Trump has personally and repeatedly urged the head of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to award a border wall contract to a North Dakota construction firm whose top executive is a GOP donor and frequent guest on Fox News,\" Nick Miroff and Josh Dawsey report. \"In phone calls, White House meetings and conversations aboard Air Force One during the past several months, Trump has aggressively pushed Fisher Industries to Department of Homeland Security leaders and Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, the commanding general of the Army Corps.\n\n\"The push for a specific company has alarmed military commanders and DHS officials. Semonite was summoned to the White House again Thursday, after the president's aides told Pentagon officials -- including Gen. Mark Milley, the Army's chief of staff -- that the president wanted to discuss the border barrier. ... Trump immediately brought up Fisher, a company that sued the U.S. government last month after the Army Corps did not accept its bid to install barriers along the southern border, a contract potentially worth billions of dollars. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, has joined in the campaign for Fisher Industries, along with Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), an ardent promoter of the company and the recipient of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Fisher and his family members.\n\n\"Trump's repeated attempts to influence the Army Corps' contracting decisions show the degree to which the president is willing to insert himself into what is normally a staid legal and regulatory process designed to protect the U.S. government from accusations of favoritism. ... But Trump's personal intervention risks the perception of improper influence on decades-old procurement rules that require government agencies to seek competitive bids, free of political interference.\n\n\"Fisher Industries was one of the six companies that built border wall prototypes outside San Diego in 2017, but the company's concrete design did not afford the see-through visibility that DHS officials wanted. ... When Fisher began promoting a steel version of the barrier that he said could be installed faster and cheaper, the Army Corps said the design did not meet its requirements and lacked regulatory approvals. ... DHS officials also told the Army Corps in March that Fisher's work on a barrier project in San Diego came in late and over budget. ... Officials from the Army Corps and DHS then met with Kushner several times to explain why Fisher wasn't the best deal. Kushner was intimately interested in ... why other companies were being chosen over Fisher ... Trump repeatedly told advisers that Fisher should be the company, administration officials said.\"\n\n-- Programming note: To celebrate Memorial Day, we'll be off on Monday. Talk to you Tuesday.

Conservatives will then pick a new leader, who will become the next prime minister. Karla Adam and William Booth report: \"It seems likely they will choose someone who at least pays lip-service to the prospect of a no-deal Brexit -- leaving the E.U. without a transition period and adopting a relationship governed by World Trade Organization rules. Economists have predicted that abrupt change would wreak havoc on both sides of the English Channel. ...\n\n\"Boris Johnson, a flamboyant politician known around the country simply as 'Boris,' once said, 'My chances of being PM are about as good as the chances of finding Elvis on Mars.' Yet he is the current favorite in opinions polls and betting markets to become the 77th British prime minister. ... A few others have already declared they want the top job, including International Development Secretary Rory Stewart and former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey. Andrea Leadsom, who resigned as House of Commons leader this week, was a finalist alongside May in 2016 and has said she is 'actively considering' another leadership bid.\"\n\n-- Europeans are still voting to form their new Parliament. Voting will end on Sunday, and the center-right European People's Party, one of the largest political groups in Parliament, is likely to lose seats to more nationalist and Euroskeptic parties. (Ruby Mellen)\n\n-- Investigating the investigators and politicizing the Justice Department, Trump formally granted Bill Barr \"full and complete authority\" to compel intelligence agencies to cooperate with the attorney general's audit of the probe into Russian election interference in 2016. Devlin Barrett, Carol D. Leonnig, Robert Costa and Colby Itkowitz report: \"The president's move gives Barr broad powers to unveil carefully guarded intelligence secrets about the Russia investigation, which the attorney general requested to allow him to quickly carry out his review. ... Conservative lawmakers ... have insisted to friends in the administration that declassifying these documents will help Trump protect his presidency and further distance himself from any political fallout from the Russia investigation, according to multiple people involved in those discussions. The move is likely to further anger Democrats who have said that Barr is using his position as the nation's top law enforcement official to aggressively protect the president and attack his critics.\"\n\n-- Stephen Calk, a former economic adviser to the president's 2016 campaign and the founder of the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago, was indicted on accusations that he approved $16 million in loans to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in exchange for help getting a post in the administration. Renae Merle and Rosalind S. Helderman report: \"As the bank rushed through the high-risk loans, Calk gave Manafort a list ranking the senior administrative jobs he wanted, starting with treasury secretary, the indictment alleges. Calk ultimately was interviewed as a candidate for undersecretary of the Army but did not get the job, prosecutors said. Calk, 54, pleaded not guilty in a Manhattan federal court Thursday afternoon and was released on a $5 million personal recognizance bond. The judge ordered him to give up his passport, firearms and not to talk to any potential witness in his case. Calk faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted of the charge of financial institution bribery. He is on a leave of absence from Federal Savings Bank of Chicago, which is privately held.\"\n\n-- Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, replied \"On it!\" when Manafort emailed to ask for help getting Calk a job. Manafort asked Kushner during the transition to ask the Trump administration to consider giving a \"major appointment\" to his banker. (Bloomberg News)\n\n-- House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said Mueller wants to testify in private. Mueller, Nadler said, is \"willing to make an opening statement, but he wants to testify in private.

(MSNBC)\n\n-- WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been charged with violating the Espionage Act. Devlin Barrett, Rachel Weiner and Matt Zapotosky report: \"An 18-count federal indictment alleges that Assange worked with a former Army intelligence analyst to obtain and disseminate secret documents -- actions similar to reporting work at many traditional news organizations. The U.S. government, though, sought to distinguish the anti-secrecy advocate from a reporter. 'Julian Assange is no journalist,' said John Demers, the assistant attorney general for national security. He said Assange had engaged in 'explicit solicitation of classified information.' Press freedom advocates said the distinction being drawn by prosecutors offers little protection for journalists. Noted media lawyer Floyd Abrams said that Assange may be a 'singularly unattractive defendant in a lot of ways' but added that the indictment 'does raise deeply threatening First Amendment issues for journalists who cover national defense, intelligence activities, and alike.'\"\n\n-- Former media mogul Conrad Black enlisted Alan Dershowitz, one of Trump's biggest on-air defenders, to get the president's attention as he sought a presidential pardon. Susan Berger and Toluse Olorunnipa: \"Dershowitz -- a Harvard law professor who has regularly gone on television to declare Trump's innocence of obstruction of justice charges -- said he wrote a letter to the White House requesting the pardon. Dershowitz's letter, which was reviewed by the White House Counsel's Office, played a major role in getting Trump and his legal advisers on board, according to Black, a Canadian billionaire and former Trump business partner who wrote a glowing book about the president last year. ... Black did not apply for the pardon through official Justice Department channels, which largely have gone unused as Trump has issued pardons to people who have praised or supported him. ... He has ... granted clemency to several people after learning of their cases on Fox News. On the same day he pardoned Black, he granted clemency to Patrick J. Nolan, the former Republican leader of the California State Assembly and a friend of [Kushner].\"\n\nCHECKS AND BALANCES:\n\n-- Another legislative defeat for Trump: The Senate approved a deal on disaster aid -- and included none of the money for the border that Trump previously demanded as a condition for signing the bill. Jeff Stein and Mike DeBonis report: \"The Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a $19.1 billion disaster-aid package ... Trump on Thursday evening wrote the Senate had his 'total support' in passing the deal. ... The deal, which congressional leaders presented hours before the Senate vote, would send aid to victims of Western wildfires, Midwestern flooding and hurricanes that hit the Southeast and Puerto Rico, as well as to other disaster-affected areas across the country. The package does not include the U.S.-Mexico border funding the Trump administration requested. ... Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) said Congress would return to border funding in a separate measure after the recess.\"\n\n-- Republicans and Democratic lawmakers are urging Trump not to go over Congress's head to complete controversial arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Karoun Demirjian and Missy Ryan report: \"Lawmakers and human rights advocates are anticipating that the administration may exploit a legal window that permits the president to circumvent congressional roadblocks, or 'holds,' on proposed arms sales. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has placed such a hold on a planned sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia, over concerns that the weapons may be used against civilian targets in war-torn Yemen. Such holds are common -- and the prospect that Trump may try to blow through several objections to such arms sales has alarmed lawmakers, who are anxious to protect their authority to have a say on the executive branch's ability to export lethal weaponry to foreign actors.\"\n\n-- The fight over Trump's financial records could land at the Supreme Court as the 2020 race peaks. Ann E. Marimow and Robert Barnes report: \"A federal appeals court in Washington said Thursday that it will expedite its review of Trump's request to block a congressional subpoena seeking financial records from the president's accounting firm. The brief ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit means the accounting firm will not give a House committee the president's business records while the case is pending. ... The decision Thursday by a three-judge panel puts that agreement in effect and calls for oral argument July 12. The timeline allows the case to move swiftly by court standards and could set up a decision from the Supreme Court that could land in the thick of the 2020 presidential campaign. If the appeals court in Washington -- and perhaps the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York, where a second similar case may be filed -- rules within a matter of weeks rather than months, the justices might have to take up procedural motions this summer.\"\n\n-- Another judge sounded skeptical of the House lawsuit aiming to block Trump from diverting money appropriated for other purposes to pay for his border wall. DOJ argues that Congress cannot sue to enforce its power of the purse. Spencer S. Hsu reports: \"Over nearly three hours of arguments, U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden of the District said there were few cases to guide how courts should rule on a major test of the constitutional separation of powers, and pressed House general counsel Douglas Letter to point to historical precedent allowing one chamber of Congress to sue the president to settle political differences. Whether the House has legal standing to sue is 'problematic' and a 'significant issue in this case,' said McFadden, citing the bedrock legal requirement that a party prove it is being harmed and show that only a court can address it. 'Courts are not there to adjudicate just interesting constitutional or political questions between the branches,' he added later.\"\n\nTRUMP VS. PELOSI:\n\n-- Trump and Pelosi traded fresh insults. The president called the House speaker \"crazy Nancy,\" while the speaker suggested his White House aides and family should consider staging an intervention \"for the good of the country.\" Rachael Bade, John Wagner and Anne Gearan report: \"The fight quickly escalated as Pelosi (D-Calif.) taunted Trump at her Capitol Hill news conference Thursday morning, a move intentionally aimed at portraying the president as erratic and upsetting him, according to an individual familiar with Pelosi's thinking. ... Furious with her scornful comments, Trump, 72, [impugned] the 79-year-old Pelosi's mental clarity -- 'she's lost it' -- and [suggested] the North American trade deal was too complicated for her to understand.\"\n\n-- Altered videos of Pelosi, intended to make her appear drunk, are quickly spreading across the Internet. Drew Harwell reports: \"The video of Pelosi's onstage speech Wednesday at a Center for American Progress event, in which she said Trump's refusal to cooperate with congressional investigations was tantamount to a 'coverup,' was subtly edited to make her voice sound garbled and warped. It was then circulated widely across Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. One version, posted by the conservative Facebook page Politics WatchDog, had been viewed more than 2 million times by Thursday night, been shared more than 45,000 times, and garnered 23,000 comments with users calling her 'drunk' and 'a babbling mess.' ... On Thursday night, Trump tweeted a separate video of Pelosi -- a selectively edited supercut, taken from Fox News, focused on moments where she briefly paused or stumbled -- that he claimed showed her stammering through a news conference.\"\n\n-- Pelosi declined to engage with Kellyanne Conway after the White House counselor took aim at her wealth. Felicia Sonmez reports: \"'I'm not going to talk about her,' Pelosi told reporters at her weekly news conference ... Conway asked Pelosi whether she had a response for the president after he stormed out of the room [on Wednesday]. ... Pelosi replied that she would respond directly to the president, not staff ... Conway -- who lives in a $7.7 million mansion in Northwest Washington -- then went on to take aim at Pelosi's personal wealth. 'Let's face it. She's the sixth-most-rich member of Congress. She treats everybody like they're her staff.' ... Roll Call listed Pelosi as the 30th wealthiest member of the House or the Senate during the last Congress, with an estimated net worth of $16 million.\"\n\nIMPEACHMENT WATCH:\n\n-- The speaker has tamped down impeachment talk among most of her rank and file, at least for now. And she may have bought herself a little more time with Congress heading into a recess. Politico's Heather Caygle and Sarah Ferris capture the state of play: \"The California Democrat sent lawmakers out the door Thursday for a 10-day Memorial Day break after tamping down swelling demands from House Democrats to launch impeachment proceedings against [Trump] ... After working to mollify the party's restive left flank this week by pointing to a pair of legal victories in their oversight battle with Trump, Democrats were ushered into the recess with new talking points from the caucus' messaging arm that were conspicuously silent on impeachment.\"\n\n-- The last time a president was threatened with impeachment, he didn't talk about it. Trump can't help but do the exact opposite. The New York Times's Peter Baker reports: \"Where Bill Clinton tried to appear above the mud fight, leaving it to aides and allies to wage the battle for him, Mr. Trump is determined to get down into the mud himself and wrestle with his enemies at every turn. Some advisers worry that the president is giving oxygen to a fire that otherwise might burn out or at least be left to crackle in the background. ... It is safe to say that there seems to be little prospect for major legislation beyond simply keeping the government open. And even that might prove problematic. 'President Trump is quite willing to sacrifice his agenda to defend himself,' said former Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who was the Democratic leader during Mr. Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999. 'He believes that no one can do that as effectively as he can, and, for him, that takes priority over any legislative issue.'\"\n\n-- Former Republican congressman Tom Coleman (Mo.) said both Trump and Vice President Pence are illegitimate. \"Impeach them,\" Coleman writes in an op-ed for today's Kansas City Star: \"The political calculus not to pursue impeachment is understandable. Current polls show a majority of voters do not favor it. But critical times require exceptional leadership. Lawmakers of both parties should not blindly follow the polls but instead follow the evidence and their conscience. Politics should not rule the day. Partisan politics is what got us to this dangerous place -- so dangerous, I believe, that the survival of our democracy is at risk. ... If this process leads to impeaching Trump in the House of Representatives and also results in convicting him in the Senate, his illegitimacy would survive through Vice President Mike Pence's succession to the presidency. Because the misdeeds were conducted to assure the entire Trump-Pence ticket was elected, both former candidates -- Pence as well as Trump -- have been disgraced and discredited.\"\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Trump is mulling the Pentagon's request to send more forces to the Middle East, acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan said. Paul Sonne and Missy Ryan report: \"The proposal from U.S. Central Command, which oversees the Middle East, comes as the military seeks to address what officials have described as a spike in threats against U.S. forces, detected by U.S. intelligence streams, from Iran and its proxy groups. ... The meeting -- which Shanahan said would involve updating the president on the security situation in Iran -- won't necessarily end in a decision. Before the meeting, Trump said he didn't think it would be necessary to send more troops to the region. 'But if we need it, we'll be there in whatever numbers we need,' he said at the White House. Shanahan dismissed reports that the United States was preparing to send as many as 5,000 or 10,000 more forces to the region. 'There is no 10,000 and there is no 5,000,' Shanahan said.\"\n\n-- Trump will visit a Japan this weekend that's been hit hard by his trade war with China. Simon Denyer and Akiko Kashiwagi report: \"In Japan there is considerable support for Trump's tough line on China, but that's mixed with concern about the impact that the trade war and China's economic slowdown is already having on Japanese exports and factory output. There are also concerns that Japan will be next in the president's trade crosshairs ... In Seoul, the won fell sharply this week and has now depreciated by nearly 5 percent against the dollar in a month, pushed down in large part by the slowdown in China, the fall in its currency, the renminbi, and the impact of the trade war. Both countries also find themselves caught in the middle of the Huawei dispute ... \"\n\n-- The U.S. military is being blamed for contaminating the environment in Okinawa with a carcinogenic chemical that's been found in the rivers around an American air base and in the bloodstream of local residents. Simon Denyer and Akiko Kashiwagi report: \"The controversy is inflaming an already sensitive situation for the U.S. military in Okinawa ... a study by two Kyoto University professors found high concentrations of a chemical called perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in rivers passing through and around the Kadena Air Base and the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. PFOS is a chemical within the PFAS family, and was used by the U.S. military as an ingredient in firefighting foam for five decades until 2015, along with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).\"\n\n-- North Korea has been testing more ballistic missiles but Trump still won't invoke the B-word. Simon Denyer reports: \"The U.S. president is clearly trying to boast about what he considers an important foreign policy success, and minimize the problems that have emerged since the collapse of his summit with Kim Jong Un in Hanoi in February.\"\n\n-- Brazil's highest court voted to extend anti-discrimination protections to LGBT people amid a spike in attacks against them since President Jair Bolsonaro began his right-wing campaign in 2018. Marina Lopes reports: \"A majority of the 11-member Supreme Federal Court voted to find it unconstitutional to exclude sexual orientation and gender from Brazil's anti-discrimination law.\"\n\n-- A prominent French journalist was summoned for questioning by police over her reports on corruption at the highest levels of Emmanuel Macron's government. Ariane Chemin, a reporter for Le Monde, first broke news in 2018 about what has become known as the \"Benalla affair,\" a scandal that has fueled allegations of a coverup within Macron's palace. (James McAuley)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Barack Obama's silence on the 2020 race has sparked speculation he could be biding his time to have major sway if Democrats fail to rally around a nominee. The Atlantic's Edward-Isaac Dovere reports: \"Obama remains firm that he won't endorse soon, while aides are stressing that he might get involved later in the process -- presumably, the thinking goes, to stop a candidate he sees as too divisive or likely to lose from becoming the nominee. (This hasn't been specified, but most assume it would be to stop Bernie Sanders.) Obama and his aides have carefully guarded when and how to deploy him; some have even theorized he could be called on to broker who the 2020 nominee is, if the primaries finish without a clear winner and Democrats face a contested convention.\"\n\nThe uncertain release date of Obama's memoir could affect the dynamics of the Democratic primaries: \"The writing has been going more slowly than he'd expected, and according to several people who have spoken with him, the 44th president is feeling competitive with his wife, whose own book, Becoming, was the biggest release of 2018 and is on track to be the best-selling memoir in history. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, like others in this story, these sources note he'll occasionally point out in conversation that he's writing this book himself, while Michelle used a ghostwriter. ... The untitled memoir, which will reportedly begin with his 2004 Democratic National Convention speech and cover his two terms in the White House, won't be released in 2019, as his publisher, Penguin Random House, had predicted just a few months ago.\"\n\n-- Pete Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan as a Navy Reserve intelligence officer, said it's \"disgusting\" that Trump is considering pardons for U.S. soldiers accused of war crimes. The Democratic presidential candidate warned that such pardons could harm the reputation of the U.S. military and its justice system. \"If the president blows a hole in that, he is blowing a hole in the military, and he is putting troops lives at risk.\" He added that during his military service, \"the flag on my shoulder represented a country that kept its word. ... If we lose that, nothing will keep us safe.\" (John Wagner)\n\n-- Buttigieg also said that NFL players protesting racial inequality by kneeling during the national anthem are \"exercising a right that I had put my life on the line to defend.\" \"The point of defending free speech is not that you expect to be perfectly aligned with every speech act that is protected,\" he said in an interview with my colleague Robert Costa. \"And when that same flag was on my shoulder, I didn't think of the flag as something that itself as an image was sacred; I thought of it as something that was sacred because of what it represented. One of the very things it represented is the freedom of speech, and that's one of the reasons I served.\" (Jacob Bogage)\n\n-- Self-help author Marianne Williamson is virtually guaranteed a spot in the first Democratic debates after meeting both the polling and donor requirements to qualify. A third poll showed Williamson at 1 percent, and her campaign previously said it has received contributions from more than 65,000 donors. (Politico)\n\n-- Nearly half of Democrats say the ideal president would be someone \"in their 50s,\" according to a new Pew Research Center poll: \"Two of the Democratic Party's best-known candidates, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, are in their 70s, yet only 3% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say this is the best age range for a president. And just 6% say it would be ideal for a president to be in their 30s. ... [M]ost who identify as or lean Democratic say it would not have much effect on their enthusiasm if the party's presidential nominee were white, a person of color, or gay, lesbian or bisexual. However, nearly a third of all Democrats (31%) - including 45% of Democratic women ages 18 to 49 - say they would be more enthusiastic if the party's nominee were a woman.\"\n\n-- \"What Reparations for Slavery Might Look Like in 2019,\" by the New York Times's Patricia Cohen: \"Who would be paid? How much? Where would the money come from? ... William A. Darity Jr., an economist at Duke University and a leading scholar on reparations, suggests two qualifying conditions: having at least one ancestor who was enslaved in the United States, and having identified oneself as African-American on a legal document for at least a decade before the approval of any reparations. ... Attaching a dollar figure to a program of reparations resembles a 'Wheel of Fortune' spin, with amounts ranging from the piddling ($71.08 per recipient under Forman's plan) to the astronomical ($17 trillion in total).\"\n\n-- As liberal groups warn of the dire consequences of recent abortion ban bills, the Democratic Governors Association is planning to back two Democratic candidates who oppose abortion rights. HuffPost's Kevin Robillard and Amanda Terkel report: The DGA \"is preparing to potentially spend millions of dollars backing two Democratic candidates who share that position: Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who has indicated he plans to sign a 'heartbeat' bill that would effectively ban abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, and Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, the all-but-certain gubernatorial candidate in Mississippi who is defending a similar law in court. ... [A]bortion-rights activists and progressives argue making that allowance for red-state candidates undermines the party's message and undercuts its supporters.\"\n\n-- The Republicans advancing restrictive abortion laws in states like Alabama and Ohio have risen to power thanks to support from white women, Ronald Brownstein explains in the Atlantic. \"In some of those states, polling shows that opposition to legal abortion is higher among white women than among white men. These attitudes underscore why it's too simplistic to forecast that the renewed push against abortion will uniformly drive women away from the GOP. There's no question that abortion-rights supporters everywhere are mobilizing in opposition to the highly restrictive new laws ... Their success will depend on whether the restrictions dislodge meaningful numbers of white women in these states from their respective Republican coalitions. And that is far from certain, particularly in the southern and border states advancing most of the laws.\"\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nThe president shared a misleading, heavily edited video of the speaker:\n\nPelosi hit back at Trump's comments about her:\n\nRep.

Elderly Mexicans are visiting their undocumented children in the U.S. - with State Department approval,\" by Kevin Sieff: \"Officials in Michoacan call them Palomas Mensajeras (Messenger Pigeons.) They are parents and grandparents in Mexico who have not seen their undocumented children in the United States for years, even decades. Since 2017, officials here have been working with the U.S. State Department to reunite those families for three-week visits in cities and towns across the United States. For many here, it is an unlikely American olive branch amid the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. But it has been welcomed by immigrant families grappling with a crisis that has rippled across both countries: The elderly parents of the estimated 5 million undocumented Mexicans in the United States are dying alone in Mexico while their children remain stuck on the other side of the border.\"\n\n-- New York Times, \"My Rapist Apologized,\" by Michelle Alexander: \"My 12-year-old daughter recently asked me what I think about abortion. She walked into the kitchen, poked around the refrigerator, then spun around and blurted it out: 'I can't decide what I think about abortion. I want to know what you think.' ... I took a deep breath. Her question took me by surprise, and yet I had been waiting for it since the day she was born. I always knew the time would come when I would have to tell my daughters the truth: I was raped. And I had an abortion. One day, you may face these challenges too.\"\n\n-- Foreign Policy, \"IR Theory and 'Game of Thrones' Are Both Fantasies,\" by Paul Musgrave: \"Since the start of the series, Game of Thrones has been catnip for scholars of world politics and foreign policy. They eagerly applied their talents and theories to ranking each character's chances of winning the throne -- repeatedly. There are scholarly journal articles about how to use a simulation based on the show to teach international relations theory. Rand Corp. has compared the show's dragons to nuclear weapons. A Foreign Affairs article argued that, despite its use of violence, the show was no realist text but 'a critique of the myopic focus on national security over the needs of individuals and the collective good.' (The author cited as evidence Daenerys Targaryen's concern for civilians, a point that didn't fare so well.) There's a good reason for this. It would be hard to imagine a fantasy world better concocted to appeal to international relations scholars than that of Westeros, the setting of Game of Thrones. After all, in many ways, international relations theory and Westeros are cousins since they descend from the same source material: bad European history.\"\n\n-- \"Date Lab:\u2009We set a straight woman up with a gay woman.

A near-perfect storm, this one.\"\n\n-- Expect today to be packed with warmth and zero mugginess. The Capitol Weather Gang forecasts: \"A great next couple of days for cleanup after our strong storms yesterday, or dealing with traffic leaving town.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nHi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news:\n\nPresident Trump's latest swipe at Huawei could be the start of a deep transformation of the tech sector.\n\nCiting national security concerns, the Commerce Department said this month that American companies would need special permission to sell some products to Huawei and other Chinese companies. This past week, things escalated.\n\nCompanies including Google, Qualcomm and Broadcom froze some of the supply of products to the Chinese technology giant. (Google, for instance, will no longer offer Huawei the full version of its Android operating system.) The crackdown may expand, with a ban on sales to Chinese surveillance companies possible.\n\nThird-country suppliers also need a license to sell products to Huawei if content from the United States contributes more than 25 percent to their value, and the British semiconductor designer ARM said it would stop licensing technology to Huawei's chip unit. (Mobile carriers in Britain also stopped offering Huawei phones to some customers, over Android support concerns.)\n\nWhat now? The United States government offered a 90-day grace period for some transactions between American companies and Huawei. That \"doesn't mean much,\" Ren Zhengfei, Huawei's founder, said, but it could signal that the overarching ban is little more than short-lived trade posturing.\n\nStill, the Trump administration has spoken repeatedly about its desire to blunt China's technological development, and China threatened to retaliate. So this could be the start of a long fight -- the raising of \"a digital Iron Curtain,\" as my colleague Li Yuan put it.\n\n\"This is a turning point,\" said Xiaolan Fu, the director of the Technology and Management Center for Development at Oxford University. \"It is changing the direction to a more closed, protectionist approach.\"\n\nIf the freeze-out persists, the near term looks rough for Huawei's smartphone division. It has stockpiled Western chips, maintained supply from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (the world's largest contract chip maker) and developed its own phone software. But it could be crippled by an inability to source components and may struggle to find markets outside China for its devices.\n\nIn the long term, the ban could push the world toward divided technologies.\n\n\"The lesson the Chinese have taken from the Trump administration's trade strategy is that the U.S. is pursuing a technology containment approach,\" said Adam Segal, the director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations. The solution is independence -- something China has pushed for by encouraging domestic tech prowess, including in chip production.\n\n\"I think we are moving toward a bifurcated technology system,\" Mr. Segal said. China uses Chinese products, and America uses American products.\n\nA big question then: Which side do other countries take? The United States probably assumes the West will follow its lead. But nations like Britain and Germany aren't yielding to American pressure to block Huawei from building next-generation 5G wireless networks over national security risks.\n\nPoorer countries are likely to be won over by price: Huawei is one of the leading, and cheapest, developers of 5G technology. For some countries wanting to jump-start economies with fast wireless networks, siding with China may be the only option.\n\nSuch fragmentation may affect consumers. Ms. Fu points out that in a globalized economy, manufacturing takes place in the most efficient location.\n\nA move to protectionism would prompt China and the United States to relocate production domestically, or at least to ally nations, which could drive up prices of devices. And the development and deployment of 5G in a fragmented environment could lack economies of scale afforded by globalism, Mr. Segal said. That could potentially delay its rollout and increase cost.\n\nWelcome to tech's Cold War.\n\nQualcomm's court loss\n\nGeopolitics isn't the only force of change in the smartphone industry: So is the tech industry's new obsession, antitrust.\n\nOn Tuesday, Judge Lucy Koh of United States District Court in San Jose, Calif., ruled that Qualcomm had suppressed competition in the smartphone chip market and charged \"onerous\" fees for the use of its patents.\n\n\"Qualcomm's licensing practices have strangled competition,\" she wrote. It must now strike new licensing agreements and be monitored for seven years to ensure compliance.\n\nPhone makers, particularly Apple, had bristled at Qualcomm's royalties, which could be as high as 5 percent of a handset's wholesale price. (Apple turned the other cheek and settled its royalty case with Qualcomm last month, sacrificing $27 billion in damages and making a payment of at least $4.5 billion to use Qualcomm's 5G chips.) So the ruling could reduce costs for smartphone makers and consumers.\n\nIt also undercuts Qualcomm's business model, which is largely based on profits from patent fees. It could also complicate efforts by the United States to assert itself in the creation of 5G networks.\n\nAmerica's first A.I. rules\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development announced a set of principles on Wednesday to guide the development of artificial intelligence. Conspicuous by its presence on the list of nations backing the rules: the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration long shied away from such policies. But as my colleague Steve Lohr reported in April, it was spurred into action by a wave of tech regulation -- particularly Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation. The realization: Regulations that would affect the nation's tech industry were coming, and federal officials needed to participate if they were to shape them.\n\nSo the administration decided to collaborate with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and this is the first time that it has formally endorsed a set of international A.I. guidelines.\n\nThe guidelines -- which suggest that A.I. should benefit people and the planet, and be designed to respect the rule of law and human rights, among other things -- aren't legally binding.\n\nBut Jack Clark, the head of policy at OpenAI, an artificial intelligence lab in San Francisco, said it was \"quite significant\" that the United States had signed on to them. It is, he said, a sign that the administration is \"putting its weight behind\" the development of A.I.\n\nSome stories you shouldn't miss\n\n\u25a0 Big Tech seized the protectionist narrative. Executives have suggested that strict regulation of their companies could hand advantages to the Chinese.\n\n\u25a0 Cleaning up Facebook brings its A.I. whiz to tears. When its chief technology officer discussed the complexity of using artificial intelligence to cure toxic content problems, he welled up.\n\n\u25a0 Tech jobs have the potential to propel people into the middle class. But so far, such results have been few and far between.\n\n\u25a0 Google Glass still exists. The latest incarnation of the smart spectacles, heavily upgraded and priced at $999, is still firmly aimed at workplace users.\n\n\u25a0 There's bipartisan support for facial recognition regulation. At a House committee hearing on Wednesday, lawmakers agreed that it seems to infringe civil liberties.\n\n\u25a0 Hackers have held Baltimore hostage.

And the best ones -- for now -- are made only by America and its allies.\n\nWith names like MEMS accelerometers and field-programmable gate arrays, they operate invisibly to consumers but are at the heart of a long-running technological race that, so far, China is losing despite billions of dollars of investments.\n\nBut while the U.S. now has a strategic edge that China can't easily counter, it may not last. By placing Huawei on its \"Entity List\" last week, threatening the future of one of China's most important international companies, the Trump administration likely prodded China to redouble its efforts to close that crucial technological gap, say industry analysts.\n\nThe U.S. move, based on national security concerns, could have long-term consequences that would not be in U.S. interests, spurring the creation of new competitors in an industry now dominated by Western companies such as Qualcomm, Intel, Arm and others.\n\nChina's renewed commitment to what it calls \"semiconductor independence\" likely already has begun, say industry experts and analysts -- and will continue even if the current trade dispute gets resolved in negotiations.\n\n\"Either way, the Chinese government and Chinese companies will look at this and try to replace a U.S. supplier with a non-U.S. supplier,\" said Stewart Randall, head of semiconductors for market consulting firm Intralink, who is based in Shanghai. \"They won't want to be in a position where the U.S. always wins.\"\n\nMEMS accelerometers allow phones to sense movement. Without them, the phone's screen would not automatically adjust when turned vertically and horizontally. They also tell users which direction to walk while following on-screen GPS directions, or sense different activities, like walking, running or cycling. They are key to newer \"augmented reality\" apps that can place virtual objects in the real world.\n\nThese sensors, which are smaller than a grain of sand, sell for anywhere from 10 cents to as much as 50 cents each. But that low price doesn't mean they're easy to make, and the U.S., German, French and Japanese companies that manufacture the most advanced versions jealously guard the process, building them in in-house semiconductor fabrication labs known in the industry as \"fabs\" to make certain the technology does not leak to competitors.\n\nThe components in the latest accelerometers are microscopic -- the term MEMS means \"microelectromechanical systems\" -- making them impossible to simply take apart and copy. To build one, a company needs to develop the technology from the ground up, or somehow acquire the detailed schematics showing how they are assembled.\n\n\"If they're not allowed to buy parts at all from American companies, eventually they'll run into problems,\" said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst on the U.S. semiconductor industry for Bernstein Research.\n\nLarger and less sophisticated chips can be developed through computer simulation, according to chip experts. But MEMS-based chips are too small for that. Developing one is a painstaking, trial-and-error process that takes years. Chip experts think in 18-month \"development cycles,\" and it usually takes about three of those cycles for a company to get up to par, they say.\n\nSo far, China isn't there.\n\nBut Chinese semiconductor companies in the past haven't had much of a business incentive to devote the research budgets to developing technologies like advanced accelerometers because they could buy them from the West. Now, with the new U.S.-imposed prohibitions, chip experts say Chinese companies like SMIC likely will go into overdrive to develop better chips for a domestic market that is suddenly in play.\n\n\"Eventually they'll get it, but it won't be any time soon,\" said James A. Lewis, a technology policy expert for the Center for Strategic & International Studies, based in Washington.\n\nOthers are not so sure it will take China long.\n\nIndustry analyst Joe Madden recalled a time, in the late 1990s, when a company he worked for was marketing a proprietary component for cellular networks and trying to decide whether to sell the component to Huawei\n\nMadden said his company assumed Huawei would take about three years to make its own version, ample time for Madden's company to profit. But Huawei had its own version in just two months, Madden recalled.\n\nMost of the key device components now made in the United States and allied countries, he said, could likely be replicated in China at some point. Until then, Huawei and its consumers would have to rely on less sophisticated components, making smartphones, for example, bulkier and glitchier.\n\n\"It think it still would take about two to three years,\" Madden, the founder of Mobile Experts in Los Gatos, Calif. \"They could live with lower performance and battery life for a time. Eventually they would catch up to where we are today.\"\n\nAnother important piece of equipment made only in the West is the field programmable gate array, or FPGA, for use in the most advanced 5G cell towers. Huawei has been purchasing these devices from U.S.-based Xilinx to help direct wireless traffic and carry out specialized tasks necessary to make 5G technology work. FPGAs are valuable for their versatility. The microprocessors in computers are like a traditional, three-bedroom homes that have all the necessities but never change. An FPGA is like a house that can have seven kitchens one day and 10 bathrooms the next, depending on what task is needed.\n\nBuilding an FPGA is incredibly complex. A single one is comprised of billions of transistors, all of which can be physically reprogrammed on the fly with computer software. But there's no standard coding language for FPGAs. Companies that build them also need to create customized software that can interact with each one of those transistors perfectly. That's a herculean task, even for big companies like California-based Intel, which paid $17 billion to acquire FPGA maker Altera in 2015.\n\nChina will require \"a humongous body of software developed in close relationship with the hardware\" to develop an FPGA industry, said Hadi Esmaeilzadeh, a professor of computer science at University of California, San Diego. \"It will be challenging.\"\n\nBut there are signs that Huawei and the Chinese government have been preparing for this moment. As far back as 2015, Chinese leaders announced \"Made in China 2025,\" a strategic plan that called for increasing independence in a range of key industries, including the production of computer semiconductors.\n\nChinese investment in the industry is projected to surpass $100 billion, and China has developed several manufacturers for chips, including a Huawei subsidiary, HiSilicon. But most Chinese chips, say industry experts, rely on designs from Arm, a British-based company that announced Wednesday that it will cut off Huawei because of the U.S. trade ban.\n\nEven before that happened, Chinese companies had failed to make some of the most advanced components in a range of major products, including for its rollout of 5G, the high-speed next generation of wireless technology expected to allow a range of new products and services including self-driving cars.\n\nAdding to Huawei's woes is the fact that their smartphones run on Google's Android operating system. While Huawei can install publicly available versions of Android, new phones won't have access to the Android Play store and won't be able to run popular Google services like YouTube, Gmail and Google Maps, unless the company can find some way to work around Google's inability to license its products to Huawei.\n\nIn implementing the trade ban against Huawei, U.S. officials cited Huawei's alleged violations of sanctions against Iran. But the Trump administration also has argued that Huawei's potential dominance of 5G networks -- it currently controls almost 30 percent of the global 5G equipment market -- would create unacceptable national security risks by giving China the advantage in gathering signals intelligence. Huawei has denied that its equipment could be used for espionage.\n\nIndustry players are watching to see if the U.S. trade ban on Huawei remains in place amid the broader trade negotiations with China. Last year U.S. officials banned another Chinese company, ZTE, over allegations that it had violated sanctions against Iran and North Korea, pushing the company to the brink of closure. But Trump lifted the ban after a few weeks after a request Trump said was made by Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nTrump underscored the unsettled nature of what will happen with Huawei Thursday afternoon by calling the company \"very dangerous\" but leaving open the door to negotiations. \"If we made a deal, I could imagine Huawei being possibly included in some form of, or in some part of, a trade deal,\" he said.\n\nFor Huawei, one alternative to paying Western companies for advanced technology is finding free versions of it. While Arm has earned billions of dollars licensing chip designs that can power mobile phones' operating systems, a group of Berkeley researchers have for years been working on a free one called RISC-V, a blueprint anyone in the world can use.\n\nThe RISC-V Foundation, created in 2015, counts technology giants like Google, Huawei, Qualcomm and others as members, but has so far made little impact on the handset industry. Thanks to a U.S. ban on Huawei, that could be about to change.\n\nEllen Nakashima contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 296396160}, {"uri": "1144322377", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-24", "time": "08:18:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-24T08:18:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5254902243614197, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/trump-visits-a-japan-buffeted-by-americas-trade-war-with-china/2019/05/24/4bbe6026-7d84-11e9-b1f3-b233fe5811ef_story.html", "title": "Trump visits a Japan buffeted by America's trade war with China", "body": "By Simon Denyer and Simon Denyer Tokyo bureau chief covering Japan, North Korea and South Korea. Akiko Kashiwagi May 24 at 3:40 AM\n\nTOKYO -- Japan's economy is faltering, South Korea's currency is plunging and both countries have been caught in the middle of U.S. efforts to isolate Chinese tech firm Huawei.\n\nAs President Trump arrives in Japan this weekend for a four-day state visit, the fallout from his trade war with China are reverberating around the region.\n\nIn Japan there is considerable support for Trump's tough line on China, but that's mixed with concern about the impact that the trade war and China's economic slowdown is already having on Japanese exports and factory output.\n\nThere are also concerns that Japan will be next in the president's trade crosshairs, with Trump impatient for a deal to open its market further to U.S. agriculture and threatening to impose steep tariffs on imported cars on national security grounds.\n\nIn Seoul, the won fell sharply this week and has now depreciated by nearly 5 percent against the dollar in a month, pushed down in large part by the slowdown in China, the fall in its currency, the renminbi, and the impact of the trade war.\n\nBoth countries also find themselves caught in the middle of the Huawei dispute: Japan effectively banned the company from competing for government contracts last December, but the private sector's ties to the company are much harder to unravel.\n\nThe Sankei newspaper reported this week that 100 Japanese companies supplied Huawei with parts worth $6.6 billion last year while some of the country's cutting-edge tech firms also collaborate with the Chinese company on development projects.\n\nShares in Japanese electronic component makers Taiyo Yuden and TDK Corp have fallen more than 20 percent this month.\n\nIn a news conference, the chairman of the Keidanren business federation said Japan would have to change its supply chain if the ban on trade with Huawei gets applied to firms here. \"So as not to step on the tail of the U.S. tiger, we must take measures,\" Hiroaki Nakanishi warned on Monday, according to local media.\n\nIn Seoul, the Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported this week that the U.S. government is lobbying South Korea not to use Huawei products.\n\nWhile the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei has helped pushed up shares this week in its competitors in the smartphone market, such as Samsung and LG Electronics, it hit shares in the company's suppliers and sparked wider concerns in a country that depends on China for nearly a quarter of its exports.\n\n\"Lacking a governmental strategy, South Korea gets dragged into a war between China and the United States,\" Chosun Ilbo wrote in an editorial Friday. \"Strategizing on security with the United States and the economy with China will not work anymore, as the two have started an explicit fight for supremacy.\"\n\n[Japan's Abe visits White House in bid to soothe Trump's ego and avoid his ire]\n\nThe broader trade war is also a concern in Japan. A survey of more than 1,000 companies by Mizuho Research Institute, found that more than half are concerned about its impact.\n\nMany are moving to dual-bases for the Asian operations -- not pulling out of China but limiting investment there while expanding operations elsewhere in Southeast Asia, Mizuho found.\n\nThe bigger question is whether Japan will be sucked into a trade war of its own with the United States.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe has been carefully courting Trump to prevent that happening, and on his April visit to Washington boasted that Japanese companies have invested $23 billion to create 43,000 jobs in the United States since Trump took office.\n\nStill, Japan finds its auto industry threatened with 25 percent tariffs, although Trump recently declared he would delay imposing them for 180 days to allow room for negotiations on restricting import volumes.\n\nThe threat was greeted with an unusually sharp rebuke from Akio Toyoda, the president of Toyota Motors and chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, who said he was \"deeply saddened.\"\n\n\"We are dismayed to hear a message suggesting our longtime contributions of investment and employment in the United States are not welcomed,\" he said in a statement.\n\nJapan's car companies, keen to avoid trade frictions, have long operated factories in the United States, and Toyota alone has promised to invest nearly $13 billion there between 2017 and 2021.\n\nBut it is not only cars that are buzzing in Trump's trade bonnet. Japan's decision to push ahead with the Trans Pacific Partnership, an 11-nation trade deal, and also its success in agreeing to a separate deal with the European Union, has resulted in promises to cut agricultural tariffs for a whole swath of countries -- just not the United States.\n\nBecause Trump withdrew from the TPP, the United States is not one of them, and U.S. pork, wheat and barley exporters are already reported to be under pressure.\n\nTrump wants Japan to agree to swift agriculture tariff cuts.\n\nJapan says any deal has to be reciprocal and include corresponding concessions by the United States, to comply with WTO rules and have a chance of ratification by Japan's parliament.\n\nTatsuhiko Yoshizaki, a market economist at Sojitsu Research, says the TPP and Japan-E.U. trade pacts have strengthened Japan's hand in the trade talks with the United States.\n\n\"When the latest round of talks began, Japan did feel under pressure, as it's beholden to U.S.-Japan security relations,\" he said. \"But thinking hard, the situation is different now. It is the United States that is hard pressed to make a deal without delay. Time is on Japan's side.\"\n\nMasahiko Hosokawa, a professor at Chubu University, and former Japanese trade negotiator in the 1980s and 1990s, isn't worried about a trade war. He says Abe's strategy of building a strong personal relationship with Trump is paying off, and notes that there isn't interest in Washington to go after Japan, the country's most important Asian ally.\n\n\"Both Republicans and Democrats are hoping to see President Trump be tough on China, and the tougher he gets, the more votes he gets,\" he said.\n\nHajime Takata, executive economist at Mizuho Research Institute, says Japan's trade deficit in goods, at $68 billion in 2017, was much smaller than China's $419 billion and also a much smaller share of the total than it was three decades ago.\n\n\"At a time when countries are increasingly divided globally, Japan could serve as a bridge in the divided world,\" he said.\n\nMin Joo Kim in Seoul contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nFrom the emperor to sumo wrestling, Abe harnesses Japan's traditions to impress Trump\n\nJapan effectively bans China's Huawei and ZTE from government contracts, joining U.S.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/y00AIV0Z5pP-00dfBhTXP36zwcM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BNHE5IT564I6TDW66SV7KIPPC4.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4806759", "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 296381880}, {"uri": "1144178674", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-24", "time": "04:04:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-24T04:04:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/business/huawei-us-china-europe-.html", "title": "Huawei's European Customers Are Put on Hold by U.S. Ban", "body": "LONDON -- Europe has been one of Huawei's biggest success stories. Now it is on the front line of the trade and technology war between China and the United States.\n\nThe move by Google this week to cut off Android support to phones made by Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, will hobble their European users and highlights how deeply the Continent relies on American and Chinese companies for gadgets, apps and internet services.\n\nFrom its early days selling equipment to wireless carriers, Huawei has expanded at an extraordinary rate in Europe, capturing more than a quarter of the smartphone market. Google's action is \"potentially catastrophic\" for Huawei's hopes in Europe, said Ben Stanton, a senior analyst at Canalys, a research firm.\n\nThe Trump administration's order this month barring American telecommunications firms from using foreign-made equipment that could pose a threat to national security -- exactly what Washington has accused Huawei of doing -- is likely to have a knock-on effect on smartphone users' experience. Google Maps and other apps, for example, will not be supported.\n\nEuropean customers will be hit harder than those in the United States or China. Huawei phones are largely unavailable in the United States, and Google's services have long been blocked in China by the government.\n\nBut they are best sellers in countries like Greece, Portugal and Spain. Those phones, plus robust sales of telecommunications equipment, have made the market covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa into Huawei's second biggest after China. It accounted for 28 percent of Huawei's revenue in 2018, compared with 7 percent from the Americas.\n\nThe pressure has mounted. Since the administration's order, one company after another has moved to suspend business with the company, which is the world's second-largest smartphone maker, after Samsung.\n\nGoogle announced its pullback on Monday. The Commerce Department said it would grant a 90-day extension for companies to work out how to support existing cellular networks and handsets, but Google said it planned to abide by the ruling once the time expired.\n\nOn Wednesday, two British carriers, EE and Vodafone, said they would not offer Huawei phones to customers who wanted access to their new 5G services. Two of Japan's largest mobile carriers also said they would delay the debut of a new smartphone by Huawei.\n\nHuawei will be unable to recover quickly, analysts said.\n\n\"It would be extremely unlikely that they would use their own operating system here in the short term,\" said Dario Talmesio, a telecommunications analyst at Ovum, a research and consultancy firm in London. \"And that means people with existing Huawei devices will gradually see devices that are reliant on Android deteriorate because they are not able to perform certain upgrades.\"\n\nCustomers shopping for a handset are unlikely to buy one that doesn't come with Google's latest version of Android, apps like Gmail or the Play app store. The drop in demand for Huawei phones could also hurt European carriers that are \"very heavily relying on the quality, with fairly low cost, of Chinese devices\" to get customers onto the new hyperfast networks that are on the horizon, Mr. Talmesio said.\n\nHuawei's bottom line could suffer from the loss of sales of its more expensive phones, with their high profit margins, said Steve Tsang, the director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. And the diminished prospects in Europe may hinder Huawei's ability to expand elsewhere.\n\n\"Being able to make it in Europe means that it is a lot easier for Huawei to make it in the rest of the world,\" Mr. Tsang said. \"Success in Europe is significant for Huawei, both in terms of revenue and in terms of future growth.\"\n\nTo succeed in Europe, Huawei made a sustained effort over nearly two decades to work with network operators and allow governments to test its equipment for security flaws. Huawei first made inroads by providing cheap gear to build phone networks in countries including Britain, Germany, France and Poland. The company became the world's largest seller of telecom equipment, besting Nokia and Ericsson.\n\nHuawei deepened its reach when it began selling mobile devices, first as low-cost alternatives to a Samsung Galaxy or an Apple iPhone and then with pricier models respected for their technology. Huawei gives carriers and retailers better financial terms than rivals by allowing them to make money from every handset sale. Industry analysts said retailers had an incentive to display and promote Huawei phones.\n\nThe strategy helped Huawei sell more than 42 million smartphones in Europe last year, according to Canalys. \"Huawei has been the darling of the European smartphone industry for the last three or four years,\" Mr. Stanton of Canalys said.\n\nHuawei's growth highlights how Europe's influence in tech has faded.\n\nEuropean policymakers have been trying to nurture the region's technology sector, which played an important role in the growth of the global tech industry. Finland's Nokia was once the world's largest seller of mobile phones, and Skype, founded by Scandinavians, helped pioneer the now-common ability to make calls over the internet. But Europe could not keep up with Silicon Valley or Shenzhen, where Huawei has its headquarters.\n\nFor months, Washington has been warning allies of security risks associated with Huawei, but several balked at its assessment. The Trump administration has threatened its intelligence-sharing relationship with Germany, Britain and other allies as Huawei sought to build their fifth-generation, or 5G, networks. The networks promise not only faster cellular service but also better wireless connections for \"internet of things\" devices like autonomous cars, security cameras and industrial equipment.\n\nThe Trump administration's order moved the debate about Huawei beyond the more obscure equipment needed to make wireless networks to which handsets consumers can buy and apps they can use.\n\n\"It's not in our control,\" said Mr. Talmesio at Ovum. \"We are stuck in the middle of this commercial war, and we are becoming very much a kind of proxy war territory.\"\n\nGoogle's decision surprised potential phone buyers in Europe, and many were hesitating. Security risks were not their worry. They wanted to know that their phones would work anywhere.\n\n\"Such applications as YouTube and Google Maps, they are vital,\" said George Kirmizidis, a civil servant browsing at a BASE mobile phone shop in Brussels. \"If I cannot access those through my smartphone, what's the point of buying a smartphone altogether?\"\n\n\"As a customer, of course I would like to have the choice to choose between different products, and now Huawei is out of the market for me,\" Mr. Kirmizidis, 44, added. \"I have a limited choice of products, which is not fair if we support capitalism.\"\n\nSolongo Unurbat was examining a Huawei phone priced at more than $1,000 in the Mall of Berlin, and the 34-year-old was not concerned about the loss of Google functionality.\n\n\"For me, it's all about the camera, \" she said.\n\nKeerthana Annamaneni contributed reporting from Brussels, and Christopher F.

You look at what they've done from a security standpoint, from a military standpoint, it's very dangerous,\" Trump said. \"So it's possible that Huawei even would be included in some kind of a trade deal. If we made a deal, I could imagine Huawei being possibly included in some form of, or in some part of, a trade deal.\"\n\nAsked how that might work, Trump added: \"It's too early to say, but I mean, we're just very concerned about Huawei from a security standpoint.\"\n\n[Huawei is in the crosshairs of the Trump administration. So why do so few Americans know about the smartphone giant?]\n\n\"It shows that the Art of the Deal is alive and well,\" said Jeff Moon, who negotiated trade issues with the Chinese during the Obama administration. \"In his mind, there are no principles that are not negotiable, including national security.\"\n\nTrump's comments echoed the president's handling of a similar case in 2018 involving another Chinese company, ZTE, which had violated U.S. sanctions by shipping telecommunications equipment to Iran and North Korea.\n\nThe Commerce Department last year banned U.S. companies from supplying ZTE after finding that the Chinese manufacturer had violated the terms of an earlier settlement over its sanctions-busting.\n\nGiven ZTE's dependence upon U.S. makers of semiconductors and other essential components, the move was seen as a corporate death sentence.\n\nBut after a personal plea from Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump abruptly reversed course one month later saying that \"too many jobs in China\" otherwise would be lost.\n\nHuawei, a global leader in 5G network equipment, has long raised national security concerns among U.S. officials in both parties. Officials have said the company could design its equipment to facilitate the Chinese government's efforts to spy on the U.S. or disable critical networks in the event of a conflict -- concerns Huawei has called unfounded.\n\n\"The Huawei case is very different,\" Moon said. \"ZTE was not a spying issue. That's the difference.\"\n\nDerek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute and a sometime administration adviser, said Congress would erupt if the president chose to restore Huawei to good standing as part of a comprehensive trade deal.\n\n\"I think people will tell him: The Congress will go crazy on a bipartisan basis and you'll hurt yourself politically,\" Scissors said. \"But the president will say, if I get a good enough trade deal, it's worth it, right?\"\n\nThe national security concerns that have been raised about Huawei are \"not a priority for him,\" he added.\n\nHuawei has denied U.S. government claims that it has close links to Chinese authorities. But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNBC on Thursday that the company was lying.\n\n\"For them to say that they don't work with the Chinese government is false,\" Pompeo said. \"The Huawai CEO on that, at least, isn't telling the American people the truth.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sG0L42bpGcSIDv9ow6KSqstNhmY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/33XENHD5VII6TDW66SV7KIPPC4.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4809152", "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 296353800}, {"uri": "1144080532", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-24", "time": "00:27:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-24T00:27:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/the-blacklisting-of-huawei-might-be-chinas-sputnik-moment/2019/05/23/9352fc66-7d99-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html", "title": "Opinion | The blacklisting of Huawei might be China's Sputnik moment", "body": "By Fareed Zakaria Fareed Zakaria Columnist focusing on foreign affairs Columnist May 23 at 7:42 PM\n\nMany of us have been waiting for a new Sputnik moment, the point at which the challenge from China spurs the United States to get its act together. We may now be witnessing such a watershed, but in Beijing. The Trump administration's decision to blacklist Huawei -- the world's seventh-largest technology company -- might well be China's Sputnik moment, with seismic consequences.\n\nThe administration has provided some temporary exemptions to the blacklist, but it seems that Huawei will lose key hardware (ARM's chip design) and software (from Google) that it relies on for its cellphones and associated technology. This move can be interpreted only as an attempt by the Trump administration to kill the company, already the world's second-largest maker of smartphones.\n\nThe Chinese will see this as a turning point. If Washington can cut China off from American technology at will, China will be determined to build its own technological infrastructure, top to bottom. Huawei, anticipating this moment, has been developing its own operating system, which doesn't rely on U.S. companies, and says it could be in place by year's end. (Losing ARM would actually be a much more crippling loss for the Chinese company, making it extremely difficult for Huawei to produce its own chips.) Watching China's technological prowess these days, it is easy to imagine the country rising to this challenge.\n\nWe might be moving toward a bipolar world in digital technology with two walled-off ecosystems: U.S. and Chinese. This division would erode the open world economy, the deep levels of interdependence and the cross-border investments and supply chains that characterize the global economy today. Before traveling down this road, the United States should ensure that it has the smartest strategy in place to deal with the real challenge from China.\n\nFirst, the Trump administration should make clear the broad principles it is defending in punishing Huawei. It has so far been reluctant to outline the evidence, perhaps because it is classified. It must help the world understand that it is not simply blocking a successful foreign competitor but acting to preserve the security of networks and the privacy of individuals. The British government has concluded that it can use Huawei's technology as long as certain safeguards are put in place. We need to understand why London is wrong and Washington is right.\n\nSecond, the United States should have built an international coalition to confront Beijing. From the start, I have supported the Trump administration's tough stance on China. But I am still bewildered as to why it is going solo, rather than forging a broad alliance. Pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership remains a foolish \"own goal,\" only hurting the United States and helping China. A senior European leader told me that President Trump has dismissed European offers to act together on trade.\n\nThird, we should think through what this bipolar world would look like. China's technology will be cheaper because of its lower labor costs, looser regulations and government assistance. Huawei is already dominant in the developing world. Many of those countries might well keep opting for the cheaper technology. In their view, whatever technology they choose comes with the risk that a government -- China's or America's -- will snoop on them.\n\nFourth, is it realistic to take on China through bans and blacklists? The world is so deeply interdependent. Is there a smarter way? A senior technology executive I spoke with suggested that the better response would be for the United States to become the world's leader in encryption and countering cyberespionage. He suggested that a university such as MIT be tasked with using only Huawei products to build a system that is encrypted end to end, which would shield all data from the company. \"It would be a tall challenge but definitely one America's best engineers could solve,\" he said.\n\nFinally, isn't the real answer to China's extraordinary gains in technology to make the policy changes and investments that allow the United States to compete with Beijing? It is difficult to imagine that Washington would be able to shut down the economic rise and innovations of a dynamic country of 1.4 billion people that already boasts many of the globe's top tech companies. Instead, we need our own Sputnik moment, focusing the country to outcompete China.\n\nThis technology strategy is far more consequential than trade talks. On trade, the Trump administration has many legitimate complaints about Chinese behavior. It is playing hardball with Beijing. But the end goal is to create more economic interdependence between the two countries. If there is a deal, China will buy more American goods, invest more in America and provide more market access to American companies.\n\nA technology war would take us in a very different direction. It would lead not to a cold war but a cold peace, in a divided and less prosperous world.\n\nRead more from Fareed Zakaria's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his daily newsletter.\n\nDavid Ignatius: Wall Street expects Trump will ease up on Huawei.

While Beijing claims the camps are vocational schools, eyewitnesses -- the modern Jan Karskis -- relate a story of coerced indoctrination and mass ethnic cleansing. People are not being killed as they were under the Nazis, but their way of life and their heritage are being eradicated against their will. These people are being stamped into conformity and obedience to the ruling Communist Party.\n\nThe existence of the camps has been confirmed by satellite photography, and outside investigators have shown that China is using Xinjiang as a laboratory for intrusive surveillance of the Uighurs, from video cameras to genetic fingerprints, creating massive databases that can be used to target the population.\n\nCaught up in the trade dispute with China, the Trump administration's response has been late, and negligent. The administration is still debating whether to impose sanctions on companies and people involved in the Uighur repression. Officials should stop talking and start acting. Meanwhile, bipartisan legislation aimed at holding the Chinese accountable, sponsored by Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), has cleared the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and is in committee in the House. Hopefully it will pass both chambers soon.\n\nOne aspect of the bill would require reports to Congress on the transfer and development of technology for surveillance and mass internment, including a list of Chinese companies involved in the construction and operation of the camps. At the top of the list should be Hikvision, a giant of the video surveillance business, as well as other companies whose gear is used for such purposes. Hikvision products rely on technology sourced from the West, and denying such access can be leverage. We have previously expressed misgivings about the role of Huawei, also a Chinese corporate giant, in next-generation 5G communications networks, but cautioned about crippling sanctions that could destroy the company. However, Hikvision and others abetting the Xinjiang ethnic cleansing deserve punitive action. Also, senior Chinese officials who are overseeing the camps should be targeted by Global Magnitsky Act sanctions. These are the tools that exist today, and using them will show that the lessons of Jan Karski are not lost.\n\nNathan Sales and Sam Brownback: China's attack on Uighurs isn't counterterrorism.

Benchmark indexes in China, Germany, France and the United States all dropped. American crude oil prices were down roughly 5 percent, amid growing concern that the ongoing trade war would start to drag on global economic demand. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level this year, in a sign investors were pricing in lower levels of growth and inflation.\n\nHopes for a quick resolution to the China trade fight faded further this week, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying on Wednesday that no additional meetings with Beijing are scheduled and that he is encouraging American firms to reorient their supply chains and source their products elsewhere.\n\nChina's president Xi Jinping this week called for the Chinese people to begin a modern \"long march,\" invoking a time of hardship from the country's history as it braces for a protracted trade war with the United States.\n\n\"The tone of rhetoric that political leaders in both countries have adopted also suggests that it will take time to restore the U.S.-China relationship to where it was prior to the breakdown in talks, let alone to reach the point where a detailed agreement can be finalized,\" Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a research note on Wednesday.\n\n\"I am growing more and more skeptical that there is a place where the two sides can come to a deal,\" said Edward Alden, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"If I look at the positions the two sides have taken at the moment, I do not see a path to a deal.\"\n\nMore companies have been pulling back from doing business with Chinese firms, especially multinationals that provided services to Huawei, the telecommunications equipment giant. The Trump administration announced last week that it would blacklist Huawei over security concerns, prompting Google and mobile carriers to say they would no longer do business with it.\n\nThe Huawei ban, coupled with Mr. Trump's decision to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods and begin the process to tax another $300 billion have exacerbated tensions with Beijing. It has vowed to further retaliate on American products, particularly agricultural goods.\n\nIn a note Wednesday, analysts from Nomura Global Markets Research said their baseline scenario was that Mr. Trump would put a 25 percent tariff on all Chinese exports to the United States by the end of 2019, most likely after he is scheduled to meet with Mr. Xi Jinping at the G-20 in late June.\n\nMore restrictions on dealing with Chinese tech companies could come soon. The New York Times reported Tuesday that the Trump administration is considering another ban on American companies supplying components to Hikvision, a Chinese surveillance camera maker that has been criticized for playing a role in the Chinese government's monitoring and repression of Uighurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic minority.\n\nThe Commerce Department said Monday that it would allow Huawei to continue doing business with American companies for 90 days to prevent disruption to mobile networks that use the company's equipment. But many companies are quickly announcing plans to exit their relationships with Huawei. In addition to Google, which announced that it would cut off support to Huawei for Android hardware and software services, as well as popular applications like Maps and Gmail, German supplier Infeon announced a similar ban. The benchmark index of American semiconductor stocks fell more than 2 percent in early trading, as investors continued to grapple with Trump administration efforts to restrict sales to Huawei.\n\n[Read more about the fallout in financial markets on Thursday.]\n\nMr. Trump has been fighting several trade wars at once, wielding tariffs against metals from Europe, Japan, Canada and Mexico as well as goods from China. In response, trading partners have hit back at American farmers, imposing punishing tariffs on everything from peanut butter to soybeans to orange juice.\n\nOver the last week, the Trump administration has moved to resolve or delay trade conflicts on other fronts, to better focus its efforts on Beijing.\n\nOn Thursday, the Agriculture Department said it would provide up to $16 billion in aid to farmers hurt by Chinese trade retaliation. The amount \"is in line with the estimated impacts of unjustified retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods and other trade disruptions,\" the department said in a statement.\n\nThe new program will make $14.5 billion in direct payments to producers, channeled through the Commodity Credit Corporation, a program that helps shore up American farmers by buying their crops. The payments will be made to agricultural producers for a wide range of products, from soybeans and cotton to chickpeas and cherries, in up to three tranches, beginning in late July or early August.\n\nThe government will also implement a $1.4 billion program to purchase surplus commodities affected by the trade war and distribute them to food banks, schools and other programs for the poor, as well as put another $100 million toward developing new export markets for American farmers.\n\nThe financial support comes after the administration handed out $12 billion in emergency relief for farmers last year, also funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation.\n\n\"China hasn't played by the rules for a long time and President Trump is standing up to them, sending the clear message that the United States will no longer tolerate their unfair trade practices, which include non-tariff trade barriers and the theft of intellectual property,\" Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, said in a statement.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump has insisted any pain will be short-lived and worth the price, administration officials have grown concerned that the president could lose the support of farmers, an important political constituency, ahead of the 2020 election. Those worries helped spur Mr. Trump last week to suddenly drop steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which agreed in turn to withdraw stiff levies on American farm goods.\n\nAfter two years of steadily escalating its trade fights on front after front, the Trump administration appears to be recognizing that the window for cutting deals with allies before the 2020 election is closing. According to administration officials and lawmakers, the president and his top advisers are increasingly feeling that, on the trade front, too many issues remained unresolved and, that trade wars -- like military wars -- are best waged one front at a time.\n\nThat thinking pushed the president and his advisers to decide to delay for six months a decision about imposing tariffs on automobiles around the world, and to reverse their position last week on the tariffs they had levied on Canadian and Mexican metal. It was one of the few times the president has chosen to lift a tariff, instead of imposing new ones.\n\nRobert Lighthizer, the president's top trade adviser, had for months been trying to persuade Canada and Mexico to agree to permanent caps on the amount of metal they send to the United States. But when progress toward a sweeping trade deal with China unexpectedly stalled earlier this month, Mr. Lighthizer decided it was time to try to bring to a close the battle he had been waging in North America, the better to focus on the long war with China, according to people familiar with the deliberations.\n\nHe reached out to Canadian and Mexican officials, offering a deal in which the United States would lift its tariffs if the countries would agree to prevent future surges of metal into the United States market, these people said. If those surges happened, the United States could reimpose tariffs of 10 percent on aluminum and 25 percent on steel on the specific products affected. And Canada and Mexico would agree that, if they retaliated, it would only be on American metal and not on American farmers.\n\nOn Monday, Canada and Mexico officially lifted the tariffs they had imposed on American pork, milk, cheese, wine and other products, a major relief to American farmers who count the countries as two of their top three export markets, in addition to China.\n\nThe collateral damage to farmers from the trade clash with China now looms as a potential obstacle to the president's re-election. China's tariffs against products like soybeans and beef and a recent move to cancel a major pork order have hit swing states, including Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin, especially hard.\n\nA survey of 400 American farmers by Purdue University and the CME Group, a global markets company, showed that sentiment plunged in April, stemming from concerns about worsening tensions with China. Only 28 percent of farmers surveyed said that they believed a soybean dispute with China would be resolved by July 1, down from 45 percent in March, while 74 percent of those surveyed said now was a \"bad time\" to make big farm investments.\n\n\"Farmers are becoming increasingly anxious over their future financial performance,\" said James Mintert, the survey's principal investigator and director of Purdue University's Center for Commercial Agriculture.\n\nThe president is increasingly focused on rural communities as he looks ahead to a fight with the Democratic nominee for the 2020 election.\n\nMr. Trump's political advisers have pointed to the rapid rise of Joseph R. Biden Jr. to the top of Democrats' 2020 field, powered, in part, by the former vice president's popularity with blue-collar voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, as a reason to mitigate the pain on farms and factories of tariffs in the Midwest, current and former administration officials said.\n\nTom Vilsack, a former agriculture secretary who now represents the dairy industry, said on Friday that the removal of the tariffs was an important step but that passage of the revised North American trade agreement and new trade deals with China and Japan remain most crucial to reviving the dairy sector.\n\n\"With the difficulties experienced with the China talks, it was fair to assume that the administration needed to have some positive news coming out of the trade side of the shop,\" Mr. Vilsack said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/23/business/23DC-TRADE-promo/23DC-TRADE-promo-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v2.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800969", "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 296329140}, {"uri": "1143712715", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "15:17:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T15:17:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/05/23/escalating-us-china-trade-threats-stagger-global-markets-dow-slumps-more-than/", "title": "Escalating U.S.-China trade threats stagger global markets; Dow slumps more than 400", "body": "Technology sector is hit hard as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on Chinese firms.\n\nThe three major U.S. indexes were in retreat Thursday as the United States and China exchanged back-and-forth accusations over trade and amid the fallout from Trump's ban on Chinese smartphone giant Huawei Technologies. (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg) By Thomas Heath Thomas Heath Local business reporter and columnist, writing about entrepreneurs and companies in the Washington metropolitan area May 23 at 10:15 AM\n\nGlobal markets sagged Thursday as uncertainty over trade relations between the United States and China continued to sour investors.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average dropped 350 points at the outset, dipping into negative territory for the week, and was down 400 as of midmorning. If the Dow finishes red for the week, it would be the fifth week in a row and the first such slump in eight years.\n\nTechnology continued to sink the blue chips as President Trump ratcheted up pressure on Chinese tech firms. Energy, industrials and materials -- all vulnerable to a Chinese trade freeze -- also dragged down stocks.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index and the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite also were in retreat Thursday as the U.S. and China exchanged back-and-forth accusations over trade and amid the fallout from Trump's ban on doing business with Chinese smartphone giant Huawei Technologies.\n\n\"It's all trade and tech,\" said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer at Tigress Financial Partners. \"Tech and hopes for a trade deal drove the market up. And now it's driving it down.\"\n\nEuropean and Asian markets also took nose-dives, with the European STOXX 600 dropping 1.2 percent, the German Dax falling 1.6 percent, and France's CAC 40 hitting a negative 1.6 percent.\n\nChina's tech-heavy Shanghai Composite closed down 1.4 percent, while the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index dropped 1.6 percent Thursday.\n\nStocks had been on a roll coming into May, due to a strong U.S. economy that is thriving on low interest rates, record low unemployment and robust corporate earnings. But external forces pushed markets into a detour in the last few weeks as anticipation over a U.S. China trade deal has evaporated. The Federal Reserve also signaled that it probably will not raise rates this year, feeding more disappointment.\n\nThe U.S. also finds itself in a dangerous war of wills with the Iranian government over American sanctions on that country. The Trump administration dispatched aircraft carriers, bombers and other military equipment to the Persian Gulf region this month as threats between the two countries escalated.\n\n\"After posting the third best year-to-date return through April since WWII, the U.S. equity markets were vulnerable to any potential setback,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. \"Investors were then greeted by disappointing news about rate cuts from the Fed and a breakdown in the much-anticipated culmination to the China-U.

Instead they faced a grilling about whether their platforms are biased against conservatives.\n\nA string of Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee skipped questions about how the companies were tackling disinformation campaigns or preventing Russians from purchasing political ads on their platforms in the run-up to the 2020 election. They were more interested in whether Facebook and Twitter were \"shadow-banning\" -- quietly blocking or restricting -- conservatives' accounts on their platform.\n\n\"The minute you start putting your hand on the scale of freedom and justice to tilt it one way or another, quite frankly we've got to act as members of Congress,\" warned Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.).\n\nThe technology executives vehemently denied that they engage in shadow banning. There is no evidence that the platforms have been systematically biased against one political party.\n\nThe hearing highlights how Republicans have made it their default playbook to hammer the tech companies on this single issue over all others -- even when faced with pressing national security concerns about foreign influence campaigns ahead of the 2020 elections. But it also underscores how, even in a divided Washington, both sides are threatening to crack down on Big Tech -- though they have very different motivations for doing so.\n\nDuring the same hearing, Democrats also expressed concerns about Silicon Valley's content moderation decisions -- with a focus on curbing the spread of disinformation over their platforms. They pressed the companies on what steps they had taken to prevent foreign actors from buying political ads on their platform and how effectively they were coordinating with one another to address security threats.\n\nRepublicans are using the groundswell of criticism on both sides to bolster the case for change. Meadows told the companies their \"freelance\" approach to making content decisions is \"over with.\"\n\n\"Even if it takes extreme measures, you have now collided with a bipartisan issue for different reasons, and we'll make sure that we do that,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans alike have been escalating their attacks on the tech giants in recent months. As prominent Democratic presidential candidates make calls to break up Facebook, the White House has stepped up its own attacks against the social network, as well as Google-owned YouTube and Twitter. The White House last week launched a tool where people could submit stories about times they felt they experienced bias on these services.\n\nSome of Trump's top allies in Congress sought to drill down on these allegations. They asked questions focused on an incident at Twitter last year when the company said it accidentally limited the visibility of four Republican members of Congress -- including Meadows and the panel's ranking member Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio) -- in its search results. When users typed their names into Twitter, they did not auto-populate, according to reporting from Vice News.\n\nKevin Kane, Twitter's public policy manager, said the company made a mistake, which it quickly fixed and publicly explained. But the members pressed him on why it appeared only Republican members of Congress were impacted by the mistake.\n\nDemocrats have largely brushed off Republicans' accusations of bias against conservatives, but in a rare display of bipartisanship, Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), the chairman of the subcommittee hosting the hearing, warned the companies that he found the Republicans' accusations concerning.\n\n\"That worries me,\" Lynch said. \"Certainly I probably didn't agree with anything those members were ... but still it is free speech. Right now we have 257 million Americans with smart phones and everyone is mobile right now, so the scale of what can happen if you make a mistake as you've conceded is enormous so that cannot happen, that cannot happen. Especially in the campaign context, that hurts our credebility as well.\"\n\nBITS: Both Republicans and Democrats blasted facial recogntion at a Congressional hearing yesterday, raising concerns that the artificial intelligence software could pose a threat to Americans' privacy and civil rights, my colleague Drew Harwell reports.\n\nMembers of the House Oversight and Reform Committee slammed the largely unregulated technology as inaccurate and invasive, and several raised the prospect of passing a federal law regulating the technology that is growing in popularity with law enforcement. Some members even raised concerns about whether the technology could be used by the U.S. government as it is in China to exert social control.\n\nCommittee chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) said there's a consensus among lawmakers that they should crackdown on the technology. \"The question, he said, is whether the systems should face a moratorium while the technology is assessed or refined, or whether it should banned outright,\" Drew wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon shareholders voted on two facial recognition proposals yesterday -- including a sales ban on the technology that The Technology 202 covered yesterday. Both of the proposals failed. However the breakdown of the votes has not yet been released, and if shareholders got at least 3 percent of the votes, they could bring forward the proposals again in the future. (Amazon chief exeutive Jeff Bezos also owns The Post.)\n\nNIBBLES: Justice Department staffers reviewing the proposed merger of T-Mobile and Sprint have recommended that the agency sue to block the $26 billion deal due to concerns that such a deal could limit competition, my colleague Tony Romm writes.\n\nThe recommendation came before the companies pledged this week to divest certain lines of business and to cap prices for consumers. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai signaled he would greenlight the deal following those concessions earlier this week.\n\nWhile Justice Department staff has made this recommendation, it's not a final decision. DOJ's top antitrust official, Makan Delrahim, will make the final call. A spokesman for DOJ declined to comment to Tony.\n\n\"A lawsuit to block the merger -- if it is brought -- would mark a rare break within the government's own ranks,\" Tony writes.\n\nBYTES: Huawei holds a measly 0.03 percent of the U.S. market for handset sales. But abroad it's a phone-making juggernaut that was on track to surpass Apple as the second-largest phone maker in the world before the Trump administration took aggressive actions against the company in recent weeks, my colleague Greg Bensinger writes.\n\nMany American's aren't even familiar with the company in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, largely due to a decade-long rift with the U.S. Greg writes the allegations against the company sound \"straight out of a James Bond film\" and include espionage, trade violations and intellectual property theft.\n\nBrittney Jones, a 27-year-old Olympia, Wash., resident is one of the small minority of Americans who prefers Huawei phones. She said she's never met another American who owns a Huawei phone, except for the man she bought her own handset from on Craigslist. She preferred the device due to its front-facing camera.\n\n\"I didn't really care what the name was,\" Jones, a student, who researched the phone online, told Greg. \"It's not fair that we don't have access to the best technologies in the U.S. I should be able to just go to the store and buy the best phone out there.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/7a1c2e79ae2c026f02ff03662e91aa19-3936-2624-70-8-VOZRLRSXFUI6TDXT7PKBULHE2U.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 296312700}, {"uri": "1143567051", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "12:19:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T12:19:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5333333611488342, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/us/politics/trump-administration-farm-aid.html", "title": "Trump Administration to Announce Farm Aid to Ease Pain of Trade War", "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is preparing to announce a substantial aid package for farmers as early as Thursday, one of several recent moves aimed at mollifying an important political constituency hurt by President Trump's trade war.\n\nMr. Trump has been fighting several trade wars at once, wielding tariffs against metals from Europe, Japan, Canada and Mexico as well as goods from China.

On Thursday, the White House was preparing to welcome farmers for a meeting where it expected to announce a generous bailout.\n\nThe measures are aimed at giving Mr. Trump the ability to continue his trade fight with China, which shows no signs of easing and could continue for months, if not years. Tensions between Washington and Beijing have worsened in recent weeks as the Trump administration increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, prepared to tax another $300 billion and placed Huawei, the Chinese telecom equipment giant, on a United States blacklist.\n\nA spokesperson from the Department of Agriculture said Wednesday that details on a new farming support program would be forthcoming shortly, but cautioned farmers to avoid changing their planting decisions until the details had been clarified.\n\nAfter two years of steadily escalating its trade fights on front after front, the Trump administration appears to be recognizing that the window for cutting deals with allies before the 2020 election is closing.

The United States signed that deal with Canada and Mexico late last year, but it still needs to be ratified by legislatures in all three countries.\n\nIt had become increasingly clear that the metal tariffs, which the administration once viewed as leverage to getting a revised Nafta, had become an obstacle to its resolution. Republican lawmakers, along with policymakers in Canada and Mexico, have insisted the tariffs come off before the trade pact was passed into law.\n\nAlso championing their removal was Vice President Mike Pence, who had also been pushing the president to lift the metal tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Mr. Pence, who advocated free trade policies while serving as governor of Indiana, has been touring the United States to promote the passage of the Trump administration's revised North American free trade pact and brought back stories to the White House about manufacturers and farmers who were hurt by tariffs.\n\nThe changes, while helpful, are likely to fall short of propelling the new United States Mexico Canada Agreement through the Democrat-controlled House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats have raised concerns about the deal, arguing that its labor and environmental provisions do not go far enough, and calling for the administration to roll back protections for pharmaceutical companies that Democrats say will complicate their effort to make health care more affordable.\n\nThe administration had been hoping for a Congressional vote on their trade bill this summer. But Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats are in no particular rush to give the president a major domestic policy victory in 2020. She has told associates that she is looking for a way to get to yes, while at the same time depriving Mr. Trump of a domestic policy victory she believes he lucked into.\n\nMr. Lighthizer has a good relationship with the speaker, and other Democrats, but recently he had begun to vent his frustrations about the pace of the talks, according to two senior administration officials involved on the issue.\n\nThat could pose problems for farmers who are depending on the revised pact, which includes more access to Canada's dairy market.\n\nTom Vilsack, a former agriculture secretary who now represents the dairy industry, said on Friday that the removal of the tariffs was an important step but that passage of the revised North American trade agreement and new trade deals with China and Japan remain most crucial to reviving the dairy sector.\n\n\"With the difficulties experienced with the China talks, it was fair to assume that the administration needed to have some positive news coming out of the trade side of the shop,\" Mr. Vilsack said.\n\nBoth the aid package for farmers and the lifting of tariffs on Canada and Mexico are also likely to cultivate some good will for the administration with Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa senator and farmer who also heads the powerful Senate Finance Committee, which will play a role in the deal's passage.\n\nMr. Grassley has been outspoken in his opposition to the metal tariffs and his defense of farmers. On April 28, The Wall Street Journal published an op-ed by the senator arguing that the tariffs would make it virtually impossible to pass the deal, and entitled \"Trump's Tariffs End or His Trade Deal Dies.\"\n\n\"If these tariffs aren't lifted, USMCA is dead,\" Mr. Grassley wrote. \"There is no appetite in Congress to debate USMCA with these tariffs in place.\"\n\nMr. Grassley -- whom Mr. Trump views as the archetypal representative of the Midwest's farming industry -- had given Mr. Lighthizer and Mr. Pence advance notice that he planned to publish the piece. And the article, appearing in one of the few print spaces -- The Wall Street Journal editorial page -- to which Mr. Trump pays close attention, had an impact.\n\nMr. Lighthizer quietly suggested to Mr. Grassley that the tariffs would be dropped. Last Friday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Grassley two hours before announcing the move to tell him that he was lifting the tariffs for the country's workers and farmers, according to a person familiar with the interaction.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/23/business/23DC-TRADE-01/23DC-TRADE-01-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800969", "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 296309940}, {"uri": "1143557917", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "12:08:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T12:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-finance-202/2019/05/23/the-finance-202-wall-street-may-need-to-worry-about-trump-impeachment-talk/5ce5ab3f1ad2e52231e8e782/", "title": "Analysis | The Finance 202: Wall Street may need to worry about Trump impeachment talk", "body": "It may be time for Wall Street to start sweating impeachment talk out of Washington again.\n\nInvestors have largely ignored special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe into President Trump's 2016 campaign -- and subsequent moves by Trump to stymie the investigation, and the fallout over Mueller's report -- for the past year and a half.\n\nBut that wasn't always the case. And the president Wednesday renewed the argument for markets to focus on the matter, amid gathering momentum among congressional Democrats to push for a formal impeachment inquiry. In a huffy Rose Garden performance, Trump declared legislative negotiations will grind to a halt until Democrats drops their investigations of him.\n\nThat would imperil top White House priorities that could also prompt markets to shudder, or worse. Namely, the administration is eager to forge congressional consensus on its reworked trade pact with Canada and Mexico. And as soon as late summer, according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the federal government will exhaust its borrowing authority unless Trump and Congress can agree to lift the debt ceiling. Failing to do so could have cataclysmic results for markets and the wider economy.\n\n\"You certainly want to start thinking about debt ceiling risk,\" says GeoQuant CEO Mark Rosenberg, whose firm uses artificial intelligence-powered indexes to measure various types of political risk. One of his tools -- the \"Mueller Risk Index,\" which measures the likelihood of Trump's early removal from office -- has been trending down since the release of the special counsel's report.\n\nBut his measure of institutional support for the president shows Trump is at one of his weakest points in his ability to bend the branches of government to his will. And, significantly, it shows Trump's grip weakening further as the summer wears on:\n\nThe index, Rosenberg explains, is \"an aggregate of projections for a number of issues relative to institutional support -- investigations of the president, legislative debates, legal battles, appointments and confirmations\" and more, including the fight over the debt ceiling itself. He isn't, however, ready to predict a debt default yet. \"To the extent there's an upcoming calendared event where the elevated institutional risk could have a market impact, that is it... But the pattern is pretty clear: So long as economic data supports the bull market, it's unlikely that politics will derail it,\" he says, adding the administration and lawmakers probably will forge a deal to head off a default.\n\nA senior Trump official appeared determined to communicate that message to markets on Wednesday, telling CNBC's Eamon Javers that Trump's ultimatum to Democrats wouldn't hold up progress toward deals on the debt ceiling and government funding, which is primed to run out Sept. 30. \"Debt ceiling is must-pass, as is Govt funding,\" the official texted Javers. \"So no, that isn't precluded by what happened today.\"\n\nIt wasn't long ago that investors drew a direct link between the investigations dogging the president and policy outcomes critical to economic performance.\n\nIn May 2017, the revelation that Trump pressured former FBI director James Comey to drop a probe of Michael Flynn, the president's former national security adviser, set off one of the steepest stock dives of the year. The fear at the time was that Trump's presidency would unravel before he could deliver major corporate tax cuts and deregulation.\n\nFinanciers flooded Washington analysts with questions about impeachment procedures and stopped in their tracks when Trump-related alerts popped up on their Bloomberg terminals. In June, when Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, both CNBC and Bloomberg TV carried the hearing live.\n\nInterest cooled as summer turned to fall that year and it became clearer the tax cuts were more or less on a glide path to passage.\n\nLately, investors have appeared less spooked by the specter of Washington dysfunction: The S&P 500 actually gained about 11 percent during the month-long government shutdown that ended in January. And with deadlines for the debt ceiling and a budget deal still months away, it's unlikely market participants will start to fixate on those negotiations soon.\n\n\"Obviously this is a concerning headline, but there is a meaningful difference between fiscal brinkmanship today versus fiscal brinkmanship weeks away from the debt ceiling deadline,\" Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point, said in an email.\n\n\"There is a confluence of political risk in the fall with the debt ceiling and spending deadline, but I think the market still expects a resolution on these fiscal fights. Instead, these comments reinforce our bearishness on the prospects for other efforts such as infrastructure spending or prescription drug pricing.\"\n\n-- Fed looks to hold steady. WSJ's Nick Timiraos: \"Federal Reserve officials were broadly comfortable with their make-no-moves posture on interest rates at their April 30-May 1 policy meeting. Many officials at the meeting said they expected a recent soft patch in inflation would be temporary, according to minutes released Wednesday. But several raised concerns about the implications for the economy if price pressures continued to defy expectations by holding at lower levels. Officials didn't specifically raise the prospect of an interest-rate cut, according to the minutes. Investor speculation over a rate cut had increased in the run-up to the meeting.\"\n\nNew York Fed President John Williams to reporters on Wednesday: \"I don't see any strong argument...to move interest rates one way or the other.\"\n\n-- Trade tensions rock global stocks. Bloomberg's Yakob Peterseil: \"Stocks slumped globally on Thursday as the simmering trade dispute between the world's two largest economies took a greater toll on markets. Safe assets were in demand, with gold and the yen gaining alongside the dollar and Treasuries. S&P 500 futures pointed to a big drop at the New York open after the Communist Party's flagship newspaper published two commentaries assailing American moves to curb Chinese companies. Tesla sunk to below $185 in premarket trading, setting it up for a seventh day of losses. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index headed for its worst day in two weeks as automakers tumbled after an EU official said the U.S. was unlikely to start trade talks with the bloc soon while it's preoccupied with China.\"\n\nOne early trade war winner: Active managers. MarketWatch's Chris Matthews: \"Active stock pickers are having one of their best years since the financial crisis, and these money managers can thank rising U.S.-China trade tensions for their better fortunes, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. The analysts, led by Arjun Menon, wrote in a Wednesday research note that 42% of large-cap active mutual funds are outperforming their benchmarks so far in 2019, well above the 34% rate averaged during the last decade. Menon argued that escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China are one reason for this improved performance, noting that mutual funds have been underweight the 20 S&P 500 companies with the highest sales exposure to China.\"\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\nEuropean Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the United States might not be ready to work out a trade deal. (Denis Balibouse/Reuters)\n\n-- E.U. says U.S. not ready for a trade deal: \"The U.S., which is embroiled in a tariff war with China while juggling negotiations with nations including Japan, Mexico and Canada, may not be prepared to start talks with the European Union on a proposed trade deal,\" Bloomberg News's William Horobin reports: \" 'We are ready from the EU side to start and we have the mandate,' Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU's chief trade negotiator, told reporters in Paris on Wednesday. 'But I don't think the U.S. is ready to start on the tariff negotiations.\"\n\n\"Malmstrom said she met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer earlier on Wednesday, which was the first time the two had seen each other in person since EU member states gave the European Commission the green light to begin negotiations more than a month ago.\"\n\n-- Mnuchin: Next China tariffs at least a month away: \"The United States is at least a month from enacting its proposed tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese imports as it studies the impact on American consumers, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday,\" Reuters's Jason Lange and Michael Martina report: \"'I'm still hopeful we can get back to the table. The two presidents will likely see each other at the end of June,' Mnuchin said, adding that the impact of tariffs on American consumers was a key consideration in the U.S. trade strategy.\"\n\n\"Mnuchin said the Trump administration is open to holding new talks with China if the two sides can proceed on the basis of previous negotiations.\"\n\nBut he's pressing companies for their contingency plans. \"Mnuchin said on Wednesday that he was personally questioning some of America's largest companies about their plans for weathering the Trump administration's trade war with China, including encouraging firms to reorient their supply chains and source their products elsewhere,\" NYT's Alan Rappeport writes. \"Mnuchin said he spoke to the chief financial officer of Walmart -- which recently warned that customers would see higher prices on furniture, clothing and accessories because of the duties on Chinese imports -- about how the company plans to proceed.\"\n\n-- Why 5G is at the center of the U.S.-Chinese fight over Huawei: \"5G has also played a role in the U.S. trade war with China, because of concerns that Huawei's equipment and phones can be used to spy over wireless networks,\" CNBC's Todd Haselton reports. \"Earlier this month, the Trump administration blacklisted Huawei's equipment for use in America's 5G rollout. Huawei wants U.S. business, however, and has argued that our 5G networks won't roll out quickly if we don't use its equipment.\"\n\n\"The ban on working with Huawei also hit chip businesses that work with the company, including Broadcom, Intel, Xilinx and Qualcomm, some of which also have a hand in building out 5G networks and modems. Those companies will be missing out on new business as Huawei works to expand 5G networks outside of the U.S.\"\n\n-- Steve Bannon wants to drive Huawei out of the U.S. and Europe, no matter the cost: \"Driving Huawei out of the United States and Europe is '10 times more important' than a trade deal with China, according to former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon,\" South China Morning Post's Jun Mai reports.\n\n-- Judge refuses to block bank subpoenas in defeat for Trump. The Post's Renae Merle, Michael Kranish and Felicia Sonmez: \"A federal judge on Wednesday rejected a request by President Trump to block congressional subpoenas for his banking records, dealing the latest blow to the president in his bid to battle Democratic investigations into his personal finances. The decision in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York could clear the way for Deutsche Bank and Capital One to hand over the president's financial records to Democrats in the House. Trump's attorneys could appeal the decision.\"\n\nWells Fargo, TD Bank have already handed over documents. NBC News's Leigh Anne Caldwell and Alex Moe: \"A key congressional committee has already gained access to [Trump's] dealings with two major financial institutions, two sources familiar with the House probe tell NBC News... Wells Fargo and TD Bank are the two of nine institutions that have so far complied with subpoenas issued by the House Financial Services Committee demanding information about their dealings with the Trump Organization, according to the sources...

NYT's Alan Rappeport: \"Harriet Tubman -- former slave, abolitionist, 'conductor' on the Underground Railroad -- will not become the face of the $20 bill until after President Trump leaves office, [Mnuchin] said Wednesday. Plans to unveil the Tubman bill in 2020, an Obama administration initiative, would be postponed until at least 2026, Mr. Mnuchin said, and the bill itself would not likely be in circulation until 2028.\n\n\"Until then, bills with former President Andrew Jackson's face will continue to pour out of A.T.M.s and fill Americans' wallets. Mr. Mnuchin, concerned that the president might create an uproar by canceling the new bill altogether, was eager to delay its redesign until Mr. Trump was out of office, some senior Treasury Department officials have said. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Mr. Trump criticized the Obama administration's plans for the bill.\"\n\n-- Amazon's shareholder meeting turns testy: \"Amazon's annual shareholder meeting on Thursday turned hostile as shareholders demanded change on a number of issues, ranging from renewable energy use to equal pay,\" CNBC's Eugene Kim and Paayal Zaveri report.\n\n\"Dozens of shareholders, including current employees, joined the meeting in Seattle, presenting their case in over 12 different proposals.

(iStock)\n\nFor the past year, a group of tech and cybersecurity companies has been quietly pooling their intelligence about new software bugs and hacking campaigns.\n\nThe goal of the program, organized by the nonprofit Cyber Threat Alliance, is to get fixes to all the companies' customers before the hackers know they've been spotted. It's sort of like everyone in a neighborhood locking their doors at once.\n\nAnd because the group contains industry giants such as Cisco, Symantec, McAfee and Palo Alto Networks, it's a very big neighborhood -- and can give cover to a huge swath of global businesses.\n\n\"Our members are big enough that they cover a big chunk of real estate,\" Neil Jenkins, a former Department of Homeland Security cybersecurity official who is leading the initiative for CTA, told me. \"When we do this at the same time, it makes it much harder for bad actors.\"\n\nThe effort, which CTA calls \"early sharing,\" comes as top cybersecurity officials are looking for ways industry and government can cooperate to punish government-linked hacking groups in Russia, China, Iran and North Korea that are behind many of the most damaging campaigns.\n\nBy denying those hacking groups as much access as possible, CTA can help government by making it much costlier for the groups to restart operations, its president Michael Daniel told me.\n\n\"From my perspective, the U.S. government won't be able to tackle this without the cybersecurity companies,\" said Daniel, who was White House cybersecurity coordinator during the Obama administration. \"Together we can raise the cost on the adversary much more ... than if the government does something by itself.\"\n\nTo make this work, these security companies are setting aside business concerns about competition in favor of helping improve the threat landscape. It reflects a general conclusion in recent years that companies are better off sharing big picture information about threat intelligence rather than competing for small advantages.\n\nThe program is an offshoot of CTA's main mission to share much more basic digital threat indicators among top cybersecurity companies. The effort also comes amid an industry-wide push to fight back against the ravages of cybercrime, which cost consumers about $600 billion in 2017, according to a report by McAfee.\n\nAlthough Jenkins was hesitant to quantify how much CTA members' cooperation had averted in financial damage, he said the group has delivered early warnings to millions of organizations and helped decrease the spread of some major hacking campaigns.\n\nThe early sharing program launched last year when Cisco shared information with other members about a powerful strain of malicious software it had discovered called VPNFilter. The company believed Russian hackers might use the malware to shut off the Internet for at least 500,000 people on Ukraine's Constitution Day.\n\nCisco was also sharing information about the malware with the FBI, and on May 23 -- one year ago today -- three things happened simultaneously:\n\nCisco's biggest concern about going public with what it knew was that the Russian hacking group might decide to activate the destructive component of its malware -- potentially shutting off vital internet-dependent services for hundreds of thousands of people across the globe, Matt Olney, manager of threat detection and interdiction in Cisco's Talos threat intelligence division, told me.\n\n\"We were able to use CTA as a means to get some of the world's largest security vendors to come together and have protections in place to minimize the possible negative outcomes,\" he said.\n\nThe FBI declined an interview request for this story.\n\nSince the VPNFilter alert, CTA has shared advance warnings about approximately a dozen hacking groups linked to nation-states and numerous other criminal hacking campaigns, Jenkins told me.\n\nFor example, Symantec shared early information about a China-linked group that allegedly stole and repurposed hacking tools the National Security Agency used against it. The company also shared early data about another group based in Iran that compromised government agencies throughout the Middle East.\n\nThe group has also met to strategize about hacking threats exposed by other organizations, Jenkins told me -- including a new form of ransomware that locked up networks at the Norwegian aluminum maker Norsk Hydro in March, causing $40 million in damage, and a bug Microsoft revealed last week that could be as destructive as the $4 billion WannaCry attack launched by North Korea.\n\n\"It's good to have a unified place to share this information with trusted parties who are well placed to deliver unified protection very quickly to a large portion of the Internet,\" Olney said. \"And it's more consequential for threat actors.

Beijing will match \"extreme pressure\" from the U.S. with its own measures, he said in remarks posted on the ministry's website.\n\nThe trade frictions have \"aroused great concern from the international community,\" Wang said. \"I stress to everyone that China's actions are not just about preserving our own legitimate rights and interests but also to maintain the norms of international relations and safeguard the international free trading system.\"\n\nA security group dominated by Moscow and Beijing, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization also includes Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India and Pakistan.

It could also target Apple and other companies that rely on Chinese manufacturing and sales.\n\nSo far, though, Beijing has sought to win sympathy and support by burnishing its credentials as a rules-abiding member of the World Trade Organization.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry lashed out Thursday at an order by the Trump administration that will cut access for Chinese technology companies such as telecom gear giant Huawei to advanced American computer chips and other components.\n\nThe move, to take effect after a 90-day grace period, constitutes the use of \"American national power to suppress Chinese companies,\" the ministry said in a statement on its website. This \"not only seriously disrupts regular business cooperation between the sides' enterprises, but also seriously threatens the security of the global industrial supply chain.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has singled out Huawei, accusing it of posing a security threat.

It is also putting at risk a wide array of U.S.-China technology cooperation, including easy access to visas for researchers and venture capital funds for U.S. start-ups -- and threatening to boomerang on U.S. companies that China might retaliate against.\n\nThe administration's decision to blacklist one of China's most prominent companies, Huawei Technologies, along with the likelihood that U.S. officials will take similar action against additional Chinese targets, means the administration's offensive against China is likely to intensify before Trump meets Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit in Japan at the end of June.\n\n\"The trade war really is more about technology than about trade,\" said Paul Triolo, who heads Eurasia Group's global technology policy practice. \"Our sense is that the gloves are off.\"\n\nThe escalating U.S. actions are starting to inflict genuine pain on China.\n\nOn Wednesday, two British telecommunications companies, Vodafone and a unit of BT Group, said they would halt the use of Huawei smartphones on their newest networks. And Arm Holdings, a major designer of mobile-phone computer chips, said it was \"complying with all of the latest restrictions set forth by the U.S. government.\"\n\nAs the financial casualties mount, Xi shows no signs of blinking. On Wednesday, during a visit to southern China, he urged people to prepare for difficulties that he likened to a \"new Long March.\"\n\nThe reference was to the Communists' 1934 fighting retreat that traversed more than 5,000 miles and became an inspirational touchstone for later generations, filling a role akin to that of Valley Forge or Gettysburg in the United States.\n\nIn coming weeks, the administration is expected to impose sanctions on Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology as part of a crackdown on Chinese companies and possibly government officials involved in repressive government policies in Xinjiang province in western China, Triolo said.\n\nOther Chinese companies involved in supplying cameras and computers for the \"Big Brother\" surveillance system that China uses to control the Muslim inhabitants of Xinjiang, known as Uighurs, also may be hit with a range of U.S. punishments, according to Triolo and other industry executives tracking the administration debate.\n\nAmong the potential targets is Hangzhou's Zhejiang Dahua Technology, the world's second-largest video surveillance company, with revenue of $3.4 billion last year.\n\nAn estimated 3 million Uighurs are detained in government camps, Randall Schriver, the assistant U.S. defense secretary for Asia, said earlier this month.\n\nCui Tiankai, China's ambassador to the United States, has denied reports of concentration camps and insisted that Xinjiang residents voluntarily attend vocational training centers. Xi is certain to bristle over any U.S. penalties tied to what Chinese officials traditionally describe as their internal affairs.\n\nThe administration is moving on other fronts to limit commercial ties between the two countries.\n\nEarlier this month, the Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously to bar China Mobile from providing telecom services in the United States. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the commission was \"looking at\" licenses previously granted to two other Chinese carriers, China Unicom and China Telecom.\n\nA Treasury Department-led panel now scrutinizes more closely proposed Chinese investments in U.S. technology companies, and the Commerce Department is drafting new regulations to limit exports to China of 14 categories of advanced technologies, including quantum computing, robotics and artificial intelligence.\n\nLittle more than two weeks ago, the United States and China were on the brink of what Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin billed as a \"historic\" trade deal. Eleventh-hour efforts by Chinese negotiators to water down core provisions prompted Trump instead to more than double tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods and begin the process of taxing all products from China.\n\nOver the past week, Trump also has unleashed his national security team, which has been eyeing tough measures against China for more than a year. On May 15, the president signed an executive order giving the commerce secretary power to bar U.S. companies from buying foreign telecom equipment that might open U.S. networks to \"potentially catastrophic effects.\"\n\nHuawei was not named in the presidential order, but analysts said the measure was clearly aimed at the Chinese telecom giant, which had $105 billion in sales last year.\n\n\"The meltdown of the trade talks gave license to the national security hawks to really run with the ball. It seems like this is just the beginning,\" said David Hanke, a partner at Arent Fox and a former Senate Intelligence Committee staffer. \"China has been waging a tech war against us, but until now the U.S. government was barely pushing back.\"\n\nThe administration says the crackdown is warranted to prevent Chinese companies from embedding their products with technology back doors that would allow Beijing -- in the event of a conflict -- to spy on Americans or disrupt essential services.\n\nIn 2017, the Army ordered a halt to the use of drones manufactured by Shenzhen-based DJI, a leading maker of the unmanned aerial vehicles, amid U.S. government warnings that they were sending data to computer servers in China.\n\nThe company denied the reports, but just this week the Department of Homeland Security alerted U.S. companies about \"the inherent risks associated with using [drone] technology manufactured in China\" and suggested measures they should take to reduce those risks.\n\nChinese companies are heavily dependent on U.S. suppliers for many critical components, including semiconductors. When the Commerce Department last year barred U.S. companies from supplying ZTE, another Chinese telecom company, it was widely seen as a death sentence for the company.\n\nTrump lifted the ban after a personal appeal from Xi and the company's agreement to pay a $1 billion penalty.\n\nChina does not enjoy equivalent leverage, but Chinese authorities can inflict pain on U.S. tech companies if they choose to do so. China accounts for more than 90 percent of global production of rare-earth materials used in smartphones, batteries, guided missiles and other products.\n\n\"China has few if any companies that supply technology inputs to U.S. companies that America either don't produce or cannot buy from friendly nations. China does, however, have a dominant position in rare-earths, a position they have achieved in large part through predatory pricing,\" said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. \"This now can be a potent weapon because rare-earths are key inputs to many advanced products. And while Australia produces rare-earths and the U.S. has significant rare-earth resources, ramping these up will take time.\"\n\nChina also can retaliate against U.S. action via various administrative measures. Already, roughly 1 in every 5 U.S. companies operating in China have experienced additional government inspections or slower customs clearances during the tariff war, according to a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China.\n\nWith little more than five weeks before the American and Chinese presidents are scheduled to meet, most analysts say they think Trump still wants a trade deal.\n\nHe has been mum on Huawei, neither tweeting triumphantly nor warning of potential security risks. And the Commerce Department has granted a temporary license, allowing U.S. companies to continue supplying existing Huawei operations for 90 days, well past Trump's G-20 meeting with Xi.\n\n\"I still think the White House wants a deal,\" said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"Right now, we're in free fall. The hope is we can find some equilibrium.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/piTWIQB8xMXrEbaL_X5KSL74wBQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MCSDVGD4ZII6TDW66SV7KIPPC4.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 296279760}, {"uri": "1143131297", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-23", "time": "01:01:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-23T01:01:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5058823823928833, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/23/wall-street-expects-trump-will-ease-up-huawei-dont-be-so-sure/", "title": "Opinion | Wall Street expects Trump will ease up on Huawei.

(Hector RETAMAL / AFP)HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP/Getty Images By David Ignatius David Ignatius Columnist covering foreign affairs Columnist May 22 at 8:39 PM\n\nWith the Huawei case, as with so many other Trump administration gambits, the puzzling question is whether President Trump is using tough tactics to make a deal -- or whether he really means to put China's most powerful telecommunications company on what's informally known as the \"kill list\" by denying it U.S. technology.\n\nU.S. financial markets have been fairly calm this week, and investors appear to be assuming that Trump is using the Huawei sanctions as a bargaining chip. They seem to be expecting that Trump will ease Huawei sanctions as part of an eventual overall trade deal with China, perhaps brokered at a summit meeting with President Xi Jinping in Osaka, Japan, next month.\n\nSeveral Wall Street contacts told me Wednesday that the markets took it as evidence of flexibility that on Monday the Trump administration granted a 90-day reprieve before Huawei is placed on the deadly \"Entity List,\" which would block Google and other U.S. companies from selling technology to the Chinese telecom giant. Investors apparently see Trump as repeating his maneuver with ZTE Corp. last year, when he imposed harsh sanctions and then withdrew them, at Xi's request.\n\nBut analysts who carefully follow China warn that this scenario for an eventual megadeal may be overly optimistic. They note several factors that could get in the way:\n\n-- Beijing has signaled through various channels this week that it won't conduct further trade negotiations with Washington until Huawei issues are resolved, according to two U.S. China-watchers. This would require Trump to retreat on Huawei before getting the trade deal he wants, something he may resist.\n\n-- Trump's actions against Huawei have a detailed framework. First came a broad executive order on May 15 declaring a \"national emergency\" to impose controls on the import of products that threatened U.S. communications security. Then came a designation by the Commerce Department that U.S. companies selling technology to Huawei must obtain a special license because Huawei \"is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security,\" according to Commerce. These actions will be hard to reverse.\n\n-- Trump's decision to grant the 90-day reprieve may reflect U.S. desire to clean up details of the Entity-List process, rather than willingness to compromise. Officials say the Commerce designation was imposed in haste, without detailed review or briefing of allies, partly because of Trump's pique at China's refusal to cut the expected deal on trade. Trump wanted action quickly and selected the biggest guns in the U.S. trade arsenal.\n\nTrump's anger toward Beijing was voiced by Robert E. Lighthizer, the chief U.S. trade negotiator, on May 6, on the eve of the breakdown of negotiations. \"We have seen an erosion in commitments by China ... [a] retreating from specific commitments that had already been made,\" he told reporters.\n\nSince then, U.S.-Chinese trade relations have gone downhill fast, with the imposition of the executive order and the Commerce announcement that Huawei was on the entity list.\n\nOne U.S. expert on trade with China warned Wednesday against expecting any easy breakthrough soon. \"I've gone from bullish on prospects of a deal ... [to thinking] this will take time,\" he said. This expert added that a Trump-Xi meeting in Osaka could provide the \"best opportunity to change posturing and tone,\" but he cautioned, \"If two leaders miss that opportunity to blink, we could see prospects of a deal before elections slide away.\"\n\nWhat went wrong? \"Both sides miscalculated and overplayed their hand,\" this trade expert argued. He predicted: \"Xi will not surrender to U.S. demands even if some of the asks are reasonable and in line with responsibilities of a great economic power which China has become.\"\n\nDavid Ignatius: Trump loves walls.

She prefers Huawei.\n\nShe is part of such a small group that the 27-year-old Olympia, Wash., resident says she has never met another Huawei owner, save for the man she bought the handset from for $800 in cash last year after seeing a listing on Craigslist.\n\nJones bought the device because of its superior front-facing camera, perfect for taking selfies, she said. \"I didn't really care what the name was,\" said Jones, a student, who researched the phone online. \"It's not fair that we don't have access to the best technologies in the U.S. I should be able to just go to the store and buy the best phone out there.\"\n\nHuawei -- pronounced \"hwa-way\" -- commands a measly 0.03 percent of the U.S. market for handset sales, according to Gartner, and is available primarily on Amazon. But abroad it is a giant and, until a kerfuffle with the Trump administration this month, was on a clear path to overtake Apple as the second largest seller of mobile phones in the world for the year.\n\n[U.S. blacklisting of Huawei prompts global firms to follow suit]\n\n\"They are as good or even better than Samsung, but for a lower price,\" said Roger Entner, an analyst for Recon Analytics. Its phones -- such as the P30 Pro, available to Americans for about $900 on Amazon -- have won generally positive reviews. Like Samsung, Huawei phones run on Google's Android operating software.\n\nHuawei's microscopic U.S. market share -- far behind Apple, Samsung and LG -- is due largely to a roughly decade-long spat with the U.S. government over a laundry list of allegations straight out of a James Bond film: espionage, trade violations and intellectual property theft. Huawei booked about $107 billion in sales last year, up 20 percent from a year earlier, with nearly half of that coming from its consumer business, which includes smartphones. The rest of its revenue comes from other divisions selling 5G network equipment, as well as services such as cloud computing. By comparison, Boeing posted $101 billion in sales in 2018.\n\nU.S. officials believe that Huawei maintains close ties to the Chinese government, and as a result, have tried to keep the company at bay. The company says it is owned entirely by employees. Huawei has steadfastly denied the U.S. allegations, to little effect. Huawei didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA 2012 congressional report contended Huawei's telecom equipment, including gear essential for deploying 5G networks, posed a national security threat. As a result, U.S. carriers such as AT&T and Verizon haven't offered Huawei's mobile phones for sale. Other companies have also taken action against Huawei: As long ago as 2003, Silicon Valley firm Cisco sued the Shenzen-based company over claims Huawei stole software code for routers and network switches.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States has sought the extradition from Canada of Huawei's chief financial officer, who happens to be the daughter of the company's founder, over fraud charges.\n\nThe dispute with the United States reached a boiling point this month when the Trump administration said it would ban U.S. firms from providing components or services to Huawei, effectively preventing it from manufacturing phones or other equipment. Google said complying with the ban would mean future phones sold by Huawei would be without a license for its Android operating software and would have no access to its Play app store, which would render them nearly useless.\n\nA similar sanction last year on Chinese firm ZTE, over alleged trade violations, crippled it and forced it to accept a $1 billion fine, among other penalties. The device-maker's U.S. smartphone market share has crumbled in recent years, analysts say, representing a tiny fraction of leaders Apple and Samsung.\n\nA few years ago, Huawei was ascendant in the United States, gaining market share by offering handsets to lower-income customers on prepaid plans. It sponsored a 2013 U.S. tour by teen heartthrobs the Jonas Brothers, with executives spinning up plans to be \"a leading smartphone brand.\"\n\nThat has largely come true -- just not in the United States, the world's third largest smartphone market after China and India. In this year's first three months, Huawei sold 59.1 million smartphones globally and had a 19 percent market share, up from 12 percent a year earlier, making it the second largest ahead of Apple and behind Samsung's 23 percent, according to IDC data. As recently as last year's fourth quarter, Apple held the second spot by market share. Huawei's increase was all the more notable because industry-wide growth in smartphone sales has declined for six straight quarters, IDC said.\n\nBecause of the U.S. ban on American companies supplying to Huawei -- which could come into effect in August following a 90-day reprieve -- subsequent Huawei devices are likely to be without popular Google apps such as Gmail and YouTube. Huawei would have to seek out publicly available versions of the Android operating software, rather than getting them directly from Google.\n\nExisting Huawei customers will continue to be able to download the latest versions of Google apps, the U.S. search engine company said.\n\nHuawei has said it can deploy mobile operating software it has been developing on its own, if it needs to. Chief executive Ren Zhengfei struck a defiant tone on Chinese state television this week, saying the 90-day reprieve was of little value.\n\nMeanwhile, Silicon Valley firms could face skimpier sales of routers, computer chips and other components they typically ship to Huawei, which spent $11 billion buying from U.S. companies out of its roughly $70 billion budget last year.\n\nMicrosoft, which had offered Huawei laptops on its website, recently pulled them, according to reports.\n\nFirms such as Qualcomm and Intel, as well as smaller companies supplying Huawei with components, have seen their shares slip in recent days.\n\nJones, the U.S. Huawei fan, expressed concern her P20 Pro smartphone would falter amid the international dispute. \"I can't live without my phone,\" she said. \"I absolutely love it.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/T8ui0s0qfVTZ4RFMk6ghhPpT7To=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AKMXG5D4D4I6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4801602", "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 296258280}, {"uri": "1142853653", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "16:57:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T16:57:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.9372549057006836, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/asia/china-surveillance-xinjiang.html", "title": "How China Uses Technology to Segregate and Subdue Minorities", "body": "KASHGAR, China -- A God's-eye view of Kashgar, an ancient city in western China, flashed onto a wall-size screen, with colorful icons marking police stations, checkpoints and the locations of recent security incidents. At the click of a mouse, a technician explained, the police can pull up live video from any surveillance camera or take a closer look at anyone passing through one of the thousands of checkpoints in the city.\n\nTo demonstrate, she showed how the system could retrieve the photo, home address and official identification number of a woman who had been stopped at a checkpoint on a major highway. The system sifted through billions of records, then displayed details of her education, family ties, links to an earlier case and recent visits to a hotel and an internet cafe.\n\nThe simulation, presented at an industry fair in China, offered a rare look at a system that now peers into nearly every corner of Xinjiang, the troubled region where Kashgar is located.\n\nThis is the vision of high-tech surveillance -- precise, all-seeing, infallible -- that China's leaders are investing billions of dollars in every year, making Xinjiang an incubator for increasingly intrusive policing systems that could spread across the country and beyond.\n\nIt is also a vision that some of President Trump's aides have begun citing in a push for tougher action against Chinese companies in the intensifying trade war. Beyond concerns about market barriers, theft and national security, they argue that China is using technology to strengthen authoritarianism at home and abroad -- and that the United States must stop it.\n\nHow China Turned a City Into a Prison\n\nChildren are interrogated. Neighbors become informants. Mosques are monitored. Cameras are everywhere.\n\nDeveloped and sold by the China Electronics Technology Corporation, a state-run defense manufacturer, the system in Kashgar is on the cutting edge of what has become a flourishing new market for services and equipment that the government can use to monitor and subdue millions of Uighurs and members of other Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang.\n\nTreating a city like a battlefield, the platform was designed to \"apply the ideas of military cyber systems to civilian public security,\" Wang Pengda, a C.E.T.C. engineer, said in an official blog post. \"Looking back, it truly was an idea ahead of its time.\"\n\nThe system taps into networks of neighborhood informants; tracks individuals and analyzes their behavior; tries to anticipate potential crime, protest or violence; and then recommends which security forces to deploy, the company said.\n\nOn the screen during the demonstration was a slogan: \"If someone exists, there will be traces, and if there are connections, there will be information.\"\n\nA New York Times investigation drawing on government and company records as well as interviews with industry insiders found that China is in effect hard-wiring Xinjiang for segregated surveillance, using an army of security personnel to compel ethnic minorities to submit to monitoring and data collection while generally ignoring the majority Han Chinese, who make up 36 percent of Xinjiang's population.\n\nIt is a virtual cage that complements the indoctrination camps in Xinjiang where the authorities have detained a million or more Uighurs and other Muslims in a push to transform them into secular citizens who will never challenge the ruling Communist Party. The program helps identify people to be sent to the camps or investigated, and keeps tabs on them when they are released.\n\nThe Trump administration is considering whether to blacklist one of the Chinese companies at the center of the Xinjiang effort, Hikvision, and bar it from buying American technology. Hikvision is a major manufacturer of video surveillance equipment, with customers around the world and across Xinjiang, where its cameras have been installed at mosques and detention camps. C.E.T.C. owns about 42 percent of the company through subsidiaries.\n\n\"Xinjiang is maybe a kind of more extreme, more intrusive example of China's mass surveillance systems,\" said Maya Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch who has studied the technology in the region. \"These systems are designed for a very explicit purpose -- to target Muslims.\"\n\n[The Times's Privacy Project explores the surveillance technology used by companies and governments, and where it's taking us.]\n\nVirtual fences\n\nIn the city of Kashgar, with a population of 720,000 -- about 85 percent of them Uighur -- the C.E.T.C. platform draws on databases with 68 billion records, including those on people's movements and activities, according to the demonstration viewed by a Times reporter at the industry fair, held in the eastern city of Wuzhen in late 2017.\n\nBy comparison, the F.B.I.'s national instant criminal background check system contained about 19 million records at the end of 2018.\n\nThe police in Xinjiang use a mobile app, made by C.E.T.C. for smartphones running the Android operating system, to enter information into the databases.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, which obtained and analyzed the app, said it helped the authorities spot behavior that they consider suspicious, including extended travel abroad or the use of an \"unusual\" amount of electricity.\n\nThe app, which the Times examined, also allows police officers to flag people they believe have stopped using a smartphone, have begun avoiding the use of the front door in coming and going from home, or have refueled someone else's car.\n\nThe police use the app at checkpoints that serve as virtual \"fences\" across Xinjiang. If someone is tagged as a potential threat, the system can be set to trigger an alarm every time he or she tries to leave the neighborhood or enters a public place, Human Rights Watch said.\n\n\"The government's arbitrary power is reflected, or coded, in the app,\" Ms. Wang said, adding that the system \"is programmed to consider vague, broad categories of behaviors, many of them perfectly legal, as indicators of suspiciousness.\"\n\nIntelligence agencies in many countries use sets of behavior to single out individuals for greater scrutiny. But China has taken that approach to an extreme, treating the Muslim population in Xinjiang as suspect from the start and defining suspicious behavior in sweeping terms, including peaceful religious activities such as making a donation to a mosque.\n\nThe Chinese government has defended the surveillance program, saying it has improved security in the region, and says the indoctrination camps in Xinjiang are job training centers. Hikvision has denied \"any inappropriate actions in Xinjiang,\" and C.E.T.C. declined to comment when reached by phone.\n\nC.E.T.C. traces its roots to the military research labs that helped build China's first nuclear bomb, satellite and guided missile. Established as a state defense manufacturer in 2002, it soon expanded into civilian security matters, working with Microsoft, for instance, to create a version of Windows that meets the government's internal security requirements.\n\nIn recent years, it turned to Xinjiang.\n\nThe Communist Party, which took control of the region in 1949, has long been wary of the Uighurs, whose Turkic culture and Muslim faith have inspired demands for self-rule, and sometimes attacks on Chinese targets. State investment in surveillance took off a decade ago after anti-Chinese rioting in the regional capital, Urumqi, killed nearly 200 people.\n\nThe real bonanza of security contracts came after Xi Jinping took the helm of the party in late 2012. Spending on internal security in Xinjiang totaled nearly $8.4 billion in 2017, six times as much in 2012, including funds for surveillance, personnel and the indoctrination camps.\n\nHikvision has received contracts in Xinjiang worth at least $290 million for its cameras and facial recognition systems. Another company tapping into Xinjiang's security gold rush is Huawei, the Chinese tech giant that the United States has described as a security threat. It signed an agreement last year with the region's police department to help officers analyze data.\n\n'The goal here is instilling fear'\n\nThe multilayered program to harvest information from Uighurs and other Muslims begins on the edges of towns and cities across Xinjiang in buildings that look like toll plazas.\n\nInstead of coins, they collect personal information.\n\nOn a recent visit to one checkpoint in Kashgar, a line of passengers and drivers, nearly all Uighur, got out of their vehicles, trudged through automated gates made by C.E.T.C. and swiped their identity cards.\n\n\"Head up,\" the machines chimed as they photographed the motorists and armed guards looked on.\n\nThere are smaller checkpoints at banks, parks, schools, gas stations and mosques, all recording information from identity cards in the mass surveillance database.\n\nIdentification cards are also needed to buy knives, gasoline, phones, computers and even sugar. The purchases are entered into a police database used to flag suspicious behavior or individuals, according to a 2017 dissertation by a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences that features screenshots of the system in Kashgar.\n\nNot everyone has to endure the inconvenience. At many checkpoints, privileged groups -- Han Chinese, Uighur officials with passes, and foreign visitors -- are waved through \"green channels.\" In this way, the authorities have created separate yet overlapping worlds on the same streets -- and in the online police databases -- one for Muslim minorities, the other for Han Chinese.\n\n\"The goal here is instilling fear -- fear that their surveillance technology can see into every corner of your life,\" said Wang Lixiong, a Chinese author who has written about Xinjiang as well as China's surveillance state. \"The amount of people and equipment used for security is part of the deterrent effect.\"\n\nA database stored online by SenseNets, a Chinese surveillance company, and examined by the Times suggests the scale of surveillance in Xinjiang: It contained facial recognition records and ID scans for about 2.5 million people, mostly in Urumqi, a city with a population of about 3.5 million.\n\n\"This can be pulled off by anyone, and that's the part that worries me,\" said Victor Gevers, a Dutch security researcher and co-founder of GDI Foundation, a nonprofit that promotes internet security.\n\nAccording to Mr. Gevers, who discovered the unsecured database, the online records indicate that a network of about 10,000 checkpoints in Urumqi made more than six million identifications in 24 hours.\n\nThe authorities in Xinjiang also sometimes force residents to install an app known as \"Clean Net Guard\" on their phones to monitor for content that the government deems suspicious.\n\nThe monitoring extends into homes and bodies. Kashgar and other areas of Xinjiang have in recent years systematically collected DNA and other biological data from residents, especially Muslims. Officials now collect blood, fingerprints, voice recordings, head portraits from multiple angles, and scans of irises, which can provide a unique identifier like fingerprints.\n\nThese databases are not yet completely integrated, and despite the futuristic gloss of the Xinjiang surveillance state, the authorities rely on hundreds of thousands of police officers, officials and neighborhood monitors to gather and enter data.\n\n\"We risk understating the extent to which this high-tech police state continues to require a lot of manpower,\" said Adrian Zenz, an independent researcher who has studied security spending in Xinjiang. \"It is the combination of manpower and technology that makes the 21st-century police state so powerful.\"\n\nExpanding beyond the region\n\nXinjiang's security and surveillance systems are already attracting admirers from the rest of China. Delegations of police officers from other provinces and cities have visited Kashgar and other cities to admire -- and consider adopting -- the measures.\n\nThey often visit police command centers where rows of officers peer at computers, scanning surveillance video feeds and information on residents on the C.E.T.C. platform.\n\n\"The digitalization of police work has achieved leap-like growth in Xinjiang,\" Zhang Ping, a counterterrorism officer from Jiujiang, a city in southeastern China, said during a visit to Xinjiang last year, according to an official report on the website of the city's police bureau.\n\nXinjiang's high-tech policing, he added, was \"something we should vigorously study.\"\n\nZhejiang and Guangdong, two wealthy provinces on China's southeastern coast, have been testing the C.E.T.C. surveillance system used in Xinjiang, \"laying a robust foundation for a nationwide rollout,\" the company said last year.\n\nC.E.T.C. has also signed an agreement with the police in the southern city of Shenzhen to provide an advanced \"command center information system\" similar to the one in Xinjiang.\n\nThe technology has some way to go. Dust and bad lighting can hobble facial recognition on security cameras, which struggle to track large numbers of people simultaneously. Even the best systems can be accurate in less than 20 percent of cases, according to one study published by a journal linked to the Ministry of Public Security.\n\nA technician who until recently installed and maintained computers for police surveillance in Xinjiang said police surveillance centers relied on hundreds of workers to monitor cameras, an expensive and inefficient undertaking.\n\nAnd outside urban centers, police officers often do not have the skills to operate the sophisticated systems, said the technician, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing repercussions for speaking to a journalist.\n\nThe spending spree on security in Xinjiang has left local governments across the region with staggering bills, raising questions about how the authorities can keep the systems running.\n\nIn Kashgar, for example, the county of Yengisar warned this year of a \"huge shortfall\" from spending on security and said that it had accumulated 1 billion renminbi, or about $150 million, in previously undeclared \"invisible debt.\"\n\n\"The pressure from ensuring basic spending for additional staff and to maintain stability is extraordinary,\" it said.\n\nStill, the region's leaders told officials this year that they must not wind back spending.\n\n\"Preserving stability is a hard-and-fast task that takes priority over everything else,\" the leadership said in the region's annual budget report. \"Use every possible means to find funds so that the high-pressure offensive does not let up.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_buckley@nytimes.com", "name": "Chris Buckley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/03/world/00xinjiang-surveillance-1/merlin_148274814_43def549-780f-43c7-883b-4b8514a4b194-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4806735", "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 296240220}, {"uri": "1142825372", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "16:21:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T16:21:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/business/huawei-google-japan-britain.html", "title": "Mobile Carriers in Britain and Japan Begin to Turn Away From Huawei", "body": "LONDON -- Google's decision to cut off support to Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant blacklisted by the Trump administration, is rippling across the globe as companies suspend ties to the handset maker.\n\nIn Britain, where Huawei is one of the most popular cellphone brands, two of country's biggest mobile networks, EE and Vodafone, announced they would stop offering Huawei phones to 5G customers as a result of Google's decision.\n\nIn Japan, the three largest cellphone companies also said they were reconsidering plans to sell a new series of Huawei smartphones.\n\nAnd ARM, a chip maker based in Britain, was reportedly suspending its business with Huawei because some of its designs contained technology from the United States, according to documents seen by the BBC.

His trade war has hurt many of the farmers who make up his political base, and he is eager to make good on a 2016 campaign promise to rewrite trade deals in America's favor.\n\n\"I'm pleased to announce we've just reached agreement with Canada and Mexico. We'll be selling our product into those countries without the imposition of tariffs,\" Mr. Trump said on Friday.\n\nThe United States trade representative said in a statement that the metal tariffs would be removed and both Mexico and Canada \"had agreed on the removal of all retaliatory tariffs imposed on American goods by those countries.\"\n\nThe easing of trade tensions in North America could give Mr. Trump more leeway as he pursues an ambitious trade fight with China, which has imposed tariffs on American products in retaliation for the president's levies on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods. Mr. Trump on Wednesday announced sweeping restrictions against Chinese telecom companies like Huawei, and he has threatened to tax all Chinese imports, prompting concerns from farmers and other businesses caught in the cross-fire.\n\nOn Friday, it became clear that pressure to reach an accord with Canada and Mexico before the 2020 elections outweighed the president's affection for the steel and aluminum tariffs he imposed last year.\n\nThe metal tariffs are linked to a broader free trade agreement, the newly negotiated Nafta, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Mr. Trump had described the tariffs as a source of leverage in negotiating a revision to that deal, which has yet to be ratified by legislatures in all three countries.\n\nBut both Republicans and Democrats had said they would not sign off on that deal until the White House removed metal tariffs on Canada and Mexico. They argue that the levies are raising costs for American companies and consumers, and that Canadian and Mexican retaliation is hurting American farmers and businesses.\n\nA congressional aide who has been involved in the talks between the three countries said the White House was growing increasingly sensitive to pressure from Republicans in rural states whose farmers have been suffering from reprisal that diminished their access to sell in neighboring markets. Their problems were compounded when talks with China broke down this month, this person said.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who has spent weeks traversing Midwestern states to sell the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in Congress, relayed the complaints of manufacturers and farmers hurt by the tariffs to Mr. Trump, telling him, \"We've got to get moving on this.\"\n\nWhile rescinding the metal tariffs will remove one important obstacle to the passage of the trade deal, others remain. House Democrats have insisted that the pact include more labor and environmental protections.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, is in no particular rush to give the president a major domestic policy victory in 2020, according to people familiar with her views.\n\nJes\u00fas Seade, the under secretary for North America at Mexico's Foreign Ministry, said that he hoped that ending the dispute would give \"an extra push\" toward ratifying the agreement. Mexico will lift its retaliatory tariffs in a couple of days, he said.\n\nSpeaking from Stelco, a steel producer in Hamilton, Ontario, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said on Friday that the deal was \"pure good news\" and would help clear the way for the passage of the agreement. \"We are very optimistic we will be able to move forward in coming weeks,\" he said.\n\nAs the White House eased tensions with Canada and Mexico on Friday, it continued to pressure allies elsewhere, including Europe and Japan. Those governments are still not exempt from the steel and aluminum tariffs, and they are likely to bear the brunt of auto tariffs that could reach 25 percent, should Mr. Trump opt to impose them.\n\nThe White House's announcement Friday of a delay in determining whether to impose levies on foreign automobiles delivered a temporary reprieve to global automakers and auto suppliers, which had been bracing for punishing tariffs on millions of cars imported into the United States each year. But it also set up a tense six-month period for the White House to reach trade deals with Japan, Europe and other nations that have already been complicated by mistrust and disagreements.\n\nIn a proclamation Monday, Mr. Trump said that imports of foreign cars and car parts were causing harm to the American automobile industry and threatening national security and that other countries had 180 days to address the problem through trade agreements with the United States.\n\nIf agreements \"to address the national security threat\" are not reached, Mr. Trump said he would determine \"whether and what further action needs to be taken,\" a step that could include imposing 25 percent tariffs on foreign cars.\n\nCar companies and industry groups said that a delay did not go far enough and that Mr. Trump should abandon any plan to impose car tariffs.\n\n\"The continued threat of tariffs on cars and auto parts only creates more uncertainty weakening our economy,\" said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nMany outside the administration have criticized the linkage of cars with national security, pointing out that the bulk of American auto imports come from the country's closest allies. Mexico, Japan, Canada, Germany and South Korea were together responsible for more than 85 percent of American automotive imports in 2018. Canada and Mexico have negotiated exclusions to the car tariffs as part of their earlier trade negotiations, but it is unclear if car tariffs will affect other countries, including South Korea.\n\nIn a statement, Toyota called the White House's announcement \"a major setback for American consumers, workers and the auto industry,\" saying that it \"sends a message to Toyota that our investments are not welcomed, and the contributions from each of our employees across America are not valued.\"\n\n\"The idea that U.S. automakers are threatened by automotive imports is fundamentally flawed and ill conceived,\" said John Bozzella, the president of Global Automakers, which represents foreign car brands. \"No automaker or auto parts supplier asked for this 'protection.'\"\n\nThe United States has struggled to make headway in preliminary negotiations with the European Union, which has balked at Mr. Trump's demands to allow more agricultural products like chicken and cheese into Europe.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly criticized Europe for flooding the American market with cars while limiting imports of United States vehicles, and has called for revised trade terms that make the relationship more fair. But he also previously rejected a more straightforward proposal from Europe to simply scrap automotive tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nSpeaking to the National Association of Realtors on Friday at a Washington hotel, the president denounced the European Union for putting up trade barriers to American farm products and cars.\n\n\"The European Union treats us, I would say, worse than China. They're just smaller,\" he said. \"They send Mercedes-Benzes in here like they are cookies.\"\n\nThe European Commission said in a statement Monday that it would work constructively with American partners. \"Neither the U.S. nor the E.U. can have an interest to enter a trade conflict.\"\n\nThe Trump administration wants Europe to buy more American farm products, like meat and dairy, and says a deal without agriculture will not pass Congress. But Europe insists that agriculture is not on the table.\n\nReaching a deal with Europe in six months could be difficult, especially given that elections for the European Parliament next week are expected to strengthen protectionist parties on both the left and the right. Leaders of the Green coalition in Parliament say they will not sign trade agreements with countries that have not ratified the Paris climate change accord, which Mr. Trump has pulled out of.\n\nThe United States and Japan have also been discussing a bilateral trade deal that could give American farmers more access to Japan's market. But those talks, which began nearly two years after Mr. Trump pulled out of a multilateral trade deal with Japan known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, also have yet to move beyond the initial stages.\n\nJapanese officials say that they are counting on the close relationship between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to keep trade negotiations from souring between the two countries. Mr. Trump is scheduled to visit Japan next week, and his hosts are planning a full slate of high-level hospitality. That includes a state dinner with the new emperor and empress, rounds of golf and a visit to a sumo wrestling championship, where Mr. Trump will award the winner's trophy.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/us/17DC-AUTOTARRIFF-promo-sub/17DC-AUTOTARRIFF-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 296235720}, {"uri": "1142618853", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "13:29:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T13:29:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-technology-202/2019/05/22/the-technology-202-nuns-are-leading-the-charge-to-pressure-amazon-to-get-religion-on-facial-recognition/5ce488561ad2e52231e8e755/", "title": "Analysis | The Technology 202: Nuns are leading the charge to pressure Amazon to get religion on facial recognition", "body": "Catholic nuns are leading an investor effort to pressure Amazon to get religion on facial recognition technology.\n\nAt Amazon's annual shareholders' meeting today, investors will vote on a proposal from the Sisters of Saint Joseph to ban the company from selling the technology to government agencies, unless the board grants an exception. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns the Washington Post.)\n\nSister Pat Mahoney, a member of the New York-based religious order, says the goal is to leverage the nuns' position as shareholders in the public company to raise awareness. They were alarmed by a report that Amazon was pitching its facial recognition technology, known as Rekognition, to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\n\nThe nuns see restricting facial recognition technology -- which they say could lead law enforcement to misidentify people, especially women of color -- as part of their religious group's broader work on immigration and criminal justice.\n\n\"It struck a light in most of us,\" Mahoney told me. \"It looks great when you're watching a whodunit movie on TV and you can spot the bad guy right away, but when you think about it, it is a violation of fundamental human rights to privacy.\"\n\nFacial recognition is confronting a public reckoning -- and the nuns' involvement highlights just how unusual is the coalition fighting its swift rollout by companies and the U.S. government.\n\nThey are joining a band of privacy and civil rights advocates, academics and lawmakers -- and even some tech employees who are working on the software -- who are deploying a variety of tactics to limit its use. Mahoney said she is encouraged by recent moves: San Francisco last week passed the first city-wide ban on facial recognition, prohibiting police and city agencies from using it. And Amazon employees wrote a letter last year to Bezos demanding that the company stop selling the technology to the U.S. government.\n\nBut turning to shareholders is a new front. And its part of a broader trend to use investor meetings to try to force Big Tech to change its ways. Civil rights groups and tech industry employees are increasingly deploying similar tactics to get companies to bend on issues from climate change to privacy.\n\nWhen it comes to facial recognition technology, Mahoney said, \"There's all kinds of issues at stake here. To put it simplistically, we need to catch the bad guys, but the risk is so great of misidentification and becoming a police state. It just has to be monitored, and monitoring is not in place nor is perfection of the product itself.\"\n\nIn addition to the proposed sales ban, Amazon investors today will also vote on whether the company should commission an independent report examining whether Rekognition violates civil rights or a quickly-deployed rollout could ultimately hurt its bottom line. Amazon tried earlier this year to squash the proposals, but the Securities and Exchange Commission said that the company had to allow a vote. Amazon's board recommended that investors vote against both proposals.\n\n\"In the two-plus years AWS has been offering Amazon Rekognition, AWS has not received a single report of Amazon Rekognition being used in the harmful manner posited in the proposal, but is aware of many beneficial purposes of Amazon Rekognition, including by law enforcement to help improve public safety,\" the company said in a filing.\n\nThe nuns are using shareholder activism for social change beyond facial recognition technology. The sisters work with a larger coalition of religious groups, known as the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment, that aims to use their shareholder position to address issues related to human dignity and the environment. The non-profit's work dates back to religious groups' efforts to influence corporations to divest from South Africa in the 1970s, according to its website.\n\nThe Sisters of Saint Joseph previously proposed a similar shareholder vote to pressure JP Morgan Chase to stop funding private prison companies. The company announced it would stop banking the prison industry in March.\n\n\"I call it the mission of the portfolio,\" Mahoney tells me.\n\nMahoney tells me that the vote faces long odds and is unlikley to win a majority. But she says it's just the beginning of the work her order may do on facial recognition.\n\n\"I think realistically we have to hope that we raise the issue and it sparks enough of the shareholders to think hard about it,\" Mahoney said.\n\nThe facial recognition debate is also coming to Capitol Hill. Today the House Committee on Oversight and Reform will host a hearing on the impact facial recognition can have on civil liberties with witnesses from non-profits and in academia.\n\n\"\"There's a growing consensus that this powerful surveillance technology needs to come under democratic control,\" said Neema Singh Guliani, ACLU senior legislative counsel, who will be testifying before the committee today. \"Members of Congress need to hit the pause button on law enforcement use of this dangerous surveillance technology.\"\n\nBITS: The Trump administration is considering banning another Chinese tech firm -- a move that would intensify an escalating trade conflict, according to my colleague David Lynch.\n\nNo final decision has been made yet, but the administration is readying an action against Hikvision, a maker of video surveillance technology. The possible blacklist comes just a week after the administration moved to blacklist Huawei, preventing U.S. companies from supplying the telecommunications company without a license.\n\nThe officials are considering the same penalty against Hikvision, which would add the company to the Commerce Department's \"entity list.\"\n\nThe U.S. has taken action against the company in the past on national security grounds. Last year, Congress banned federal agencies from purchasing equiptment from Hikvision, as well as Huawei, ZTE, Hytera and Dahua. Hikvision's surveillance cameras are deployed by the Chinese government in the Muslim-majority region Xinjiang to combat what the government describes as separatist terrorism.\n\nNIBBLES: Hundreds of Amazon's warehouse employees are playing video games on the clock -- racing virtual dragons or sports cars. But they aren't loafing on the job and playing Fortnite, they're trying to fill customer orders, my colleague Greg Bensinger reports.\n\nThe video games reflect a larger effort at Amazon to gamify tedious warehouse work, tracking employees' progress in a video game format. The video games are optional for thousands of workers, tasked with physically demanding jobs like plucking items from or stowing products on shelves for 10 hours per day or more.\n\n\"Developed by Amazon, the games are displayed on small screens at employees' workstations,\" Greg writes. \"As robots wheel giant shelves up to each workstation, lights or screens indicate which item the worker needs to pluck to put into a bin. The games simultaneously register the completion of the task, which is tracked by scanning devices, and can pit individuals, teams or entire floors against one another to be fastest, simply by picking or stowing real Lego sets, cellphone cases or dish soap.\"\n\nEmployees win virtual badges and other goodies for playing the games. \"Think Tetris, but with real boxes,\" Greg writes.\n\nThe games are part of a broader trend in industry to use software to mimic video game-like rewards to better retain workers for low-skilled work. Lyft and Uber have deployed such tactics to retain their fleet of drivers. Greg shared a photo of the game on Twitter:\n\nBYTES: Google will now require advertisers to get approval for ads referring to abortion services in the United States, Britain and Ireland, according to Tiffany Hsu of the New York Times.\n\nThe company announced the policy change following outrage over misleading abortion ads. Google will now require any organization running abortion-related ads to be certified as providers or non-providers. Starting in June, abortion ads will contain disclosures that say if the organization running the ad provides abortions. Companies and organizations can begin applying for certifications now.\n\nGoogle said in a statement that \"this added transparency will help ensure that users have the necessary information to decide which abortion-related ads are most relevant to them.\"\n\nGoogle's policy changes come after an organization opposing abortion appeared to pose as an abortion provider on the site. The company has faced criticism in the past for enabling so-called crisis pregnancy centers to appear as abortion providers in an attempt to convince women not to undergo the procedure.

However, even if the law is never implemented, abortion opponents in Alabama have already achieved significant success in limiting access to the procedure in the state.\n\nLawyers on both sides of the abortion debate agree on the Alabama bill's likely path through the legal system. The ACLU of Alabama and Planned Parenthood Southeast have already pledged to take the state to court to block the law. Once it is challenged, lower-court judges will be bound by Supreme Court precedent to strike down the ban, preventing its implementation. (The law is currently set to go into effect in six months.) If it is struck down, the bill's supporters will continue to appeal the decision all the way to the Supreme Court, with the hope of overturning the landmark 1973 Roe decision.\n\nAbortion opponents are especially hopeful that the historic number of federal appeals court judges appointed by President Trump, as well as his two new justices on the Supreme Court, will allow them the perfect opportunity to finally outlaw a procedure that has riven the cultural landscape since its legalization. Alabama's Republican Lt. Governor Will Ainsworth, specifically citing how Trump has \"supercharged the effort to remake the federal court system by appointing conservative jurists,\" said the inevitable legal battle over the abortion bill would allow the Supreme Court to correct its \"46-year-old mistake.\"\n\nAntiabortion groups like the Susan B. Anthony List are also pointing to the recent wave of abortion restrictions passed by statehouses as evidence of a public groundswell of support for overturning Roe, even though polling indicates most Americans don't want to see the decision reversed. Just before Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) signed the ban into law, SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser issued this optimistic statement: \"It is clearer than ever that Roe is far from being settled law in the eyes and hearts of the American people, and this is increasingly reflected in state legislatures. ... The time is coming for the Supreme Court to let that debate go forward.\"\n\nBut conservatives may be disappointed: The years-long process for the Alabama case to reach the high court could end with the justices simply deciding not to take up the case, as they chose to do with North Dakota's six-week ban and Arkansas's 12-week ban in 2016. Those rejections left in place lower-court decisions striking down the bans, an outcome that some legal experts say is the most likely for the Alabama bill.\n\nThe court already has multiple abortion cases in front of it, and some have argued that bans like Alabama's -- as well as the slightly less restrictive \"heartbeat bills\" passed in states like Ohio and Georgia -- are the least likely to attract Supreme Court review. \"First of all, the justices have given signs that they're going to go slow on the abortion issue,\" Clarke D. Forsythe, senior counsel for the antiabortion group Americans United for Life, wrote in a National Review op-ed last week. \"And some legal commentators have suggested that Chief Justice [John] Roberts will 'manage' the pace of change. The justices declined to hear two abortion cases in December and have kicked the can down the road for months with others.\" The justices also issued a list of orders Monday without mentioning two pending appeals on Indiana abortion restrictions, marking the 14th time the court has deferred action on the matter.\n\nTo be sure, abortion rights groups are treating bills like Alabama's as a fundamental threat to Roe. Rachel Sussman, the national director of state policy and advocacy for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, pointed to Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court as a chief concern that abortion rights could be on the chopping block -- particularly because Kavanaugh replaced Anthony Kennedy, who affirmed Roe in the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Now that Kennedy is gone, abortion foes hope the court has five votes to overturn the 1973 precedent. \"With Trump in the White House and Kavanaugh now on the Supreme Court, state politicians are emboldened,\" Sussman said. \"Their efforts to chip away at Roe v. Wade always had one goal, and that was to ban safe, legal abortion. And with Kavanaugh now on the court, they believe now is their time.\"\n\nIt technically takes only four justices' votes for the court to consider any of the multiple abortion cases before it. \"The U.S. Supreme Court justices have virtually absolute discretion as to what cases they take, what issues they take and on what time frame and if they will ever hear a legal issue,\" Forsythe from Americans United for Life said in an interview.\n\nBut Forsythe also noted that the justices do not need a blanket abortion ban like Alabama's to overturn Roe. \"There's this urban legend out there that a prohibition is necessary to create a test case. And that's simply wrong,\" Forsythe said. \"The Supreme Court can reexamine a precedent, or Roe v. Wade in particular, in any case that involves an abortion law that arguably conflicts with Roe. Because in any abortion case, the question is: Do they apply Roe, or some other standard?\" The late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia touched on that very issue in his concurring opinion for the 1989 Webster v. Reproductive Health Services case, which upheld Missouri's abortion restrictions without revisiting the core holding in Roe. \"The only choice available is whether, in deciding that constitutional question, we should use Roe v. Wade as the benchmark, or something else,\" Scalia wrote.\n\nBut the Supreme Court doesn't have to overturn Roe to make abortion inaccessible; for many Alabama women, it already is. The state now has only three abortion clinics, down from more than 20 in the 1990s. At the Alabama's Women's Center in Huntsville, the clinic's two doctors provide about 2,000 abortions every year. For someone who lives in the southern part of Alabama, the closest abortion clinic in the state is more than two hours away. Given the state's required 48-hour waiting period after a consultation, a woman from Mobile would have to twice drive about five hours round trip to Montgomery to get an abortion in the state.\n\nAnd other states are even more restrictive. Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia each have only one abortion clinic left because of legislative restrictions. Sussman from Planned Parenthood said that the patchwork of laws enacted by many states have created \"almost entire regions where access to abortion is almost impossible.\" Sussman argued that the latest bans should be viewed not as an aberration, but as an escalation of state legislators' long-term strategy to chip away at Roe. \"The nature of these laws certainly has sparked awareness among the American public as to the true intentions of these state politicians who want to ban safe and legal abortion,\" she said. \"But the threat to access to abortion has been real for years.\"\n\n\"For so many people, this is the reality already,\" said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, a senior staff attorney for the ACLUs Reproductive Freedom Project. \"States don't need to pass bans, and the Supreme Court doesn't need to take up one of these cases for abortion to be pushed out of reach for people.\"\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- Voters in Pennsylvania chose Republican state Rep. Fred Keller to fill an open House seat for the state's 12th Congressional District. He beat Penn State professor Marc Friedenberg (D). Felicia Sonmez reports: \"The seat was vacated in January by Rep. Tom Marino (R), who left for a job in the private sector. With 53 percent of precincts reporting, Keller had 70 percent of the vote compared with nearly 30 percent for Friedenberg. Friedenberg was also the Democratic nominee in 2018, when he lost to Marino by 32 percentage points. Pennsylvania redrew its congressional districts in 2018. The current 12th District, which covers a large and deeply conservative swath of the north and central parts of the state, voted 66.1 percent for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\"\n\n-- In Kentucky, Republican Gov. Matt Bevin defeated a strong primary challenger, setting up a showdown with his political arch-nemesis, Democrat Andy Beshear, who's challenged him over education and pension policies. From the AP's Bruce Schreiner: \"While Bevin claimed the nomination in GOP-leaning Kentucky, an upstart challenger -- state Rep. Robert Goforth -- attracted nearly 40% of the vote in a sign the combative incumbent has fence mending to do with his political base after his high-profile feuds with public school teachers. ... Beshear, the state's attorney general, defeated two prominent rivals -- Rocky Adkins and Adam Edelen -- in the four-candidate Democratic primary. He'll try to restore the governorship for Democrats and carry on a family tradition. His father, Steve, was a popular governor whose two terms preceded Bevin's tenure.\"\n\n-- A confidential Internal Revenue Service memo says tax returns must be given to Congress unless the president invokes executive privilege. Jeff Stein and Josh Dawsey report: \"The memo contradicts the Trump administration's justification for denying lawmakers' request for President Trump's tax returns, exposing fissures in the executive branch. Trump has refused to turn over his tax returns but has not invoked executive privilege. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has instead denied the returns by arguing there is no legislative purpose for demanding them. But according to the IRS memo, which has not been previously reported, the disclosure of tax returns to the committee 'is mandatory, requiring the Secretary to disclose returns, and return information, requested by the tax-writing Chairs.'\" But: The legal opinion was written last fall and is a draft memo that wasn't seen by the IRS commissioner or current chief counsel and was never forwarded to Treasury.\n\n-- The House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed Hope Hicks, a former Trump staffer, and ex-White House counsel Don McGahn's chief of staff, Annie Donaldson. Josh Dawsey, Rachael Bade and Carol D. Leonnig report: \"The committee, which voted to authorize the subpoenas weeks ago, is particularly interested in Donaldson, who took detailed notes of McGahn's exchanges with the president. McGahn was a central witness in some of the 10 instances of potential obstruction identified by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III in his report. The panel also believes Hicks, a longtime close confidant of Trump, probably knows details on several topics they are investigating. It is unclear, however, if the two women will comply with the subpoenas -- particularly after the White House earlier this month moved to block similarly subpoenaed document requests to McGahn.\"\n\n-- The Republican National Committee paid $2 million to a law firm that employs McGahn, who didn't show up for yesterday's House Judiciary Committee hearing. (Democrats may now hold him in contempt.) Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Anu Narayanswamy report: \"The payment to Washington law firm Jones Day was disclosed in new Federal Election Commission records Monday night, as a part of routine political committee filings made public every month. The RNC said in a statement that the payment was a bulk billing for two years' worth of work. The payments went to Jones Day the same month that the House Judiciary Committee began seeking McGahn's testimony in connection with its investigation into potential obstruction of justice by Trump. ... Jones Day is the main legal firm for the Trump campaign, which has paid the firm $5.6 million between January 2017 and March 2019 for legal consulting.\"\n\n-- Former secretary of state Rex Tillerson met with a bipartisan group of lawmakers and staffers from the House Foreign Affairs Committee for seven hours. Josh Dawsey reports: \"An official familiar with the session said Tillerson met with members and staffers separately, and that the White House knew of the testimony in advance and did not move to block it. The White House had no comment. Among the topics discussed were Tillerson's relationships with other White House advisers, including President Trump and his family; Trump's interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin; and how policy is made in the Middle East and North Korea. He expressed some frustrations with the president's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, the official said. Tillerson appeared voluntarily, the representative said.\"\n\n-- A federal appeals court refused to block a grand jury subpoena for testimony by Andrew Miller, a Roger Stone associate, in connection with an investigation launched by Bob Mueller. Spencer S. Hsu and Ann E. Marimow report: \"Miller was subpoenaed in June 2018 in Mueller's probe for information about longtime Trump friend and GOP operative Stone, as well as key figures in the 2016 hacking and public release of Democratic Party emails, including by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks ... Miller was also ordered to answer questions before a grand jury about Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks, entities that U.S. prosecutors have alleged were online fronts invented by Russian intelligence operatives to spread the hacked documents before the 2016 presidential election. ... The three-judge panel gave Miller seven days to persuade the Supreme Court to take the case.\"\n\n-- Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, opposes further release of documents related to his sentencing for lying to the FBI about his relationship with the Russian ambassador. Rosalind S. Helderman reports: \"The filing came in response to a request by The Washington Post, which has asked that the documents be fully unsealed, given that special counsel [Mueller] has completed his investigation and published a report about his probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Prosecutors last week released versions of the documents that were less redacted than those originally filed as U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan prepared to sentence Flynn in December.\"\n\n-- A judge ordered public release of Michael Cohen's search warrants. CNN's Katelyn Polantz and Kate Sullivan report: \"The five warrants in total encompass the searches the special counsel conducted between July and November 2017 of Cohen's emails and other content related to his email accounts, the order said ... There will be some redactions to these documents when the Justice Department makes them public, similar to the redactions made to Cohen search warrants in New York federal court.\"\n\n-- A newly released transcript shows former attorney general Loretta Lynch disputed Jim Comey's claim that she directed the former FBI director to refer to the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server as a \"matter.\" John Wagner reports: \"Lynch said she was 'quite surprised' by Comey's characterization, made during a 2017 appearance before a Senate committee as he sought to explain why he decided to take it upon himself to announce that no charges would be brought against Clinton ... A transcript of Lynch's testimony to the House Judiciary Committee was made public Monday night by ranking Republican Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.). Lynch, who served in the Obama administration, appeared in a closed session of the committee in December, before Democrats took control of the House.\"\n\nIMPEACHMENT TALK HEATS UP:\n\n-- Impeachment calls are intensifying in the House, dividing Democrats and applying new pressure to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other party leaders. Mike DeBonis, Rachael Bade and John Wagner report: \"The newly vocal Democrats say they are seeking only an impeachment inquiry -- a formal investigation that may or may not lead to the actual drafting and passage of articles of impeachment to be tried by the Senate. But for a broader group of lawmakers -- some of them moderate freshmen who unseated Republicans last year to deliver the House majority to Democrats -- that is a distinction without a difference. They fear that any rush into impeachment proceedings would betray campaign promises to focus on policy issues more directly affecting their constituents, a potentially perilous political move ahead of the 2020 elections.\"\n\n-- But Pelosi is expected to stand her ground during a closed-door meeting this morning with House Democrats. Politico's John Bresnahan and Heather Caygle report: \"Pelosi will implore Democrats to stick with her plan of continuing to investigate Trump on multiple fronts, with legal action as the backup when necessary. Pelosi will argue, as she has repeatedly in public and private, that Democrats should gather information that could be used for impeaching Trump, if the threshold for Republican support can be reached, according to Democratic aides and lawmakers. ... The senior lawmakers will discuss Monday's victory for Democrats upholding a subpoena for Trump's financial records from his accounting firm -- which Pelosi will point to as proof that her plan is working -- and a court hearing on Wednesday focused on the president's effort to stop the Democratic investigation into his dealings with Deutsche Bank.\"\n\n-- Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) took his allegation that Trump \"engaged in impeachable conduct\" to a new demographic: American schoolchildren. HuffPost's David Moye reports: \"CBS News reporter Bo Erickson photographed Amash talking up the impeachment process to teenagers on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Erickson said Amash's main point about the need to hold hearings on whether to impeach Trump is a simple one: It's 'really dangerous for our country' when people don't tell the truth.\"\n\n-- Democratic Rep. Don Beyer became the first member of Virginia's congressional delegation to call for Trump's impeachment. Jenna Portnoy reports: \"The liberal three-term congressman is one of more than two dozen Democrats who have spoken up to support an impeachment 'inquiry' in recent days. After Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), Beyer is the second capital region member to call for impeachment. In a lengthy statement, Beyer cited a list of accusations, from 'obstruction of justice' that he said was detailed in [Mueller's] report to tax fraud, in justifying his call for an impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nTHE IMMIGRATION WARS:\n\n-- Former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli is expected to be tapped for a senior role in guiding the Trump administration's immigration policy. Josh Dawsey and Nick Miroff report: \"Cuccinelli will work at the Department of Homeland Security in a senior role, a senior White House official said, declining to specify what Cuccinelli's duties will entail, what his job title will be or if he will report to Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan. The hiring appears to come in response to Trump's desire for an immigration 'czar' to help coordinate border policies across agencies, officials said, although the job will be more limited in nature. ... The former Virginia attorney general is deeply disliked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has vowed to block Cuccinelli from any Senate-confirmed post after Cuccinelli helped lead efforts in 2014 backing insurgent candidates that hurt the Senate GOP majority, McConnell advisers said.\"\n\n-- Cuccinelli made his name as a right-wing firebrand, an identity that appears to have attracted Trump even though it has distanced him from the same Republican lawmakers he'll need to work with in his new job. Marc Fisher reports: Cuccinelli has \"warned against 'an invasion' by illegal immigrants, sponsored a bill seeking to strip those immigrants' U.S.-born children of their citizenship, and speculated publicly that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. ... Between his strong rhetoric as a TV surrogate for Trump and his bedrock support among social conservatives, Cuccinelli presented the president with a combination he relishes: someone who seems loyal, is popular with his base, and is good at the politics of disruption and provocation.\"\n\n-- A Texas migrant detention center where a teenage migrant died was quarantined because of a flu outbreak. Meagan Flynn reports: \"'To avoid the spread of illness, the Rio Grande Valley Sector has temporarily suspended intake operations at the [Central Processing Center],' CBP said in a statement. 'Individuals apprehended in RGV Sector will be held at other locations until this situation is resolved.' Medical staff at the center identified migrants in custody with high fevers and exhibiting 'signs of a flu-related illness,' and they are now receiving medical treatment, CBP said. A spokesman in the Rio Grande Valley Sector did not say how many migrants were affected by the illness.\"\n\n-- HUD Secretary Ben Carson clashed with House Democrats over the administration's proposal to purge undocumented immigrants from government-subsidized housing. Tracy Jan reports: \"Democratic lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee expressed concern about the proposed rule. An internal agency analysis found it could put up to 55,000 children who are legal U.S. residents or citizens at risk of eviction and homelessness. Carson urged Congress to come to an agreement to overhaul the nation's immigration policies rather than thwart HUD's plan to require every family member living in subsidized housing be of 'eligible immigration status.'\"\n\n-- A DHS backup plan to fund border operations calls for taking $232 million from theTransporation Security Administration in a move that could increase travel times this summer. NBC News's Julia Ainsley reports: \"TSA programs identified as funding sources include $50 million set aside to buy advanced airport screening equipment and $64 million from a worker's compensation fund set aside for injured TSA employees in 2010. The funding also includes $3 million collected from loose change left in trays at airports. Funding for Transportation Security Officers, who run security screening lines in airports, are also 'in play,' the email said. Cutting funding for those officers could have a significant impact on wait times for travelers as the summer season begins.\"\n\nPERSONNEL IS POLICY:\n\n-- \"A conservative activist's behind-the-scenes campaign to remake the nation's courts,\" by Robert O'Harrow Jr. and Shawn Boburg: Leonard Leo \"is widely known as a confidant to Trump and as executive vice president of the Federalist Society, an influential nonprofit organization for conservative and libertarian lawyers that has close ties to Supreme Court justices. But behind the scenes, Leo is the maestro of a network of interlocking nonprofits working on media campaigns and other initiatives to sway lawmakers by generating public support for conservative judges. The story of Leo's rise offers an inside look into the modern machinery of political persuasion. It shows how undisclosed interests outside of government are harnessing the nation's nonprofit system to influence judicial appointments that will shape the nation for decades.\"\n\n-- Two of Trump's top advisers -- Johnny DeStefano and legislative affairs director Shahira Knight -- are leaving the White House. Josh Dawsey and Felicia Sonmez report: \"DeStefano, a counselor to the president who served as a bridge between the Republican Party and the administration, is leaving on Friday, while Knight's last day is June 7, the officials said. ... Both officials were said to be leaving on good terms -- which is often not the case in Trump's West Wing -- and for disparate reasons. ... [DeStefano] is expected to advise a number of companies, including Juul, the e-cigarette company, while helping on the campaign, according to people familiar with his plans. ... News of Knight's departure was first reported Tuesday by CNN, which cited a White House official as saying that Knight would move on to a job in the private sector.\"\n\n-- The Trump campaign and the Senate GOP clashed over the president's pollster. Politico's Alex Isenstadt reports: \"A top strategist on [Trump's] reelection campaign has withdrawn from an effort to unseat North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis in 2020 -- an arrangement that sparked tensions at the highest levels of the Republican Party. Pollster John McLaughlin's work for a Tillis primary challenger had angered leading Senate Republican campaign officials, who said the president's team should be unified in the effort to reelect both Trump and incumbent Republican senators. ... The run-in was the first major rift this year between the Trump campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, threatening to drive a wedge between the two organizations at a time of unease about the party's prospects.\"\n\nTHE DOMESTIC AGENDA:\n\n-- Top White House and congressional leaders pushed for a sweeping two-year budget deal that would reduce the possibility of another government shutdown later this year. But a day of on-and-off talks ended with no deal. Erica Werner and Damian Paletta report: \"The meeting of top administration officials and congressional leaders of both parties served to kick off what could be months of contentious negotiations ahead of a Sept. 30 government shutdown deadline, which will roughly coincide with when Congress needs to raise the nation's borrowing limit or risk default. In reaching for a two-year budget deal, lawmakers and administration officials sought to ratchet back budget brinkmanship for the remainder of President Trump's term, offering Congress and the White House a fresh start after Trump pushed the nation into a record-long 35-day government shutdown this past winter.\"\n\n-- A group of mainly Democratic states sued the Trump administration over a new federal rule giving those in the health-care industry greater latitude to refuse to provide or pay for medical services that violate their religious or moral beliefs. Amy Goldstein reports: \"The suits, plus one brought earlier this month by the city of San Francisco, seek to block the rule, announced by President Trump early this month and published Tuesday in the Federal Register. ... The lawsuits are part of a spate of federal litigation challenging various ways the Trump administration has been rewriting health-care policies. So far, courts have issued temporary injunctions to block some of the policies while the disputes play out in court.\"\n\n-- Top House Democrats blasted the Trump administration's plan to close the Office of Personnel Management. Lisa Rein reports: \"The hostile reception, alongside tepid support from Republicans, left the plan's chances in doubt and raised the possibility that the administration would dismantle some of the agency's functions on its own, even if Congress fails to pass legislation to do it. ... Critics say the proposal is a ploy to politicize the civil service by installing political appointees close to the White House.\"\n\n-- Trump said there will be no infrastructure proposal without a trade deal. Politico's Tanya Snyder and Nancy Cook report: \"'Before we get to infrastructure, it is my strong view that Congress should first pass the important and popular USMCA trade deal,' Trump wrote in a letter to [Pelosi and Schumer]. ... He also stipulated that his preference is to meld any infrastructure package with a recurring reauthorization for highway and transit programs, all but assuring a less ambitious package dedicated to traditional transportation uses, instead of a broad-spectrum vision of funding everything from veterans hospitals to broadband.\"\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Senior Trump administration officials presented lawmakers with evidence that Iran may be considering an attack on U.S. forces in the Middle East. Karoun Demirjian, Shane Harris and Karen DeYoung report: \"But some Democrats said that none of the information showed Iran was appreciably more of a threat now than in the past, and they accused the administration of being ready to attack at the slightest provocation. ... Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., faced skeptical members, some of whom said they heard echoes of a previous administration's case for war in the Middle East. ... But some Republican lawmakers saw the information differently and pointed to 'new,' 'credible,' and 'consistent' threats that Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) called 'a game-changer.'\"\n\n-- Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will participate in Trump's peace conference in Bahrain. The two nations are the first Arab countries to join the event, which is meant to draw investment to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. (Haaretz)\n\n-- As tensions over a U.S.-China trade war escalate, Trump is considering banning another major Chinese firm: Hikvision, the world's largest maker of video surveillance technology. David J. Lynch reports: \"Though no final decision has yet been reached, the administration is preparing to move against Hikvision ... The disclosure comes less than a week after the administration barred U.S. companies from supplying Huawei Technologies ... without first obtaining a U.S. government license. ... U.S. officials are said to be eyeing the same penalty for Hikvision, using a Commerce Department mechanism known as the 'entity list.'\"\n\n-- \"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blocked a bipartisan attempt to limit Chinese companies from contracting with U.S. transit systems, a move that benefited a Chinese government-backed manufacturer with a plant in his district,\" Damian Paletta and Erica Werner report. \"His behind-the-scenes intervention came as Congress was trying this year to craft a spending compromise to avert another government shutdown. McCarthy pressed lawmakers to strip out language that could have prevented the company in his district, BYD Motors, from winning federal contracts, and they relented because they feared imperiling the bill. ... McCarthy's move to protect a Chinese company's interests frustrated even some members of his own party because they have warned repeatedly that allowing Chinese-backed firms access to U.S. infrastructure systems could pose a national security risk.\"\n\n-- All of Austria's far-right Freedom Party ministers resigned amid scandal. From BBC News: \"The Freedom Party's leader Heinz-Christian Strache, who was also vice-chancellor, was forced to resign at the weekend after a video sting. Mr. Strache was filmed proposing to offer government contracts to a supposed Russian oligarch's niece. The FP\u00d6 threatened a mass resignation earlier on Monday if Interior Minister Herbert Kickl was also forced out. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz had called over the weekend for Mr. Kickl to be sacked, saying that as general secretary of the party he should take responsibility for the scandal.\"\n\n-- The U.S. is preparing charges and sanctions against people it believes to be involved with Venezuela's military-run emergency food program. The Wall Street Journal's Ian Talley, Aruna Viswanatha and Kejal Vyas report: \"The measures are expected to be rolled out in the coming weeks and months as part of a bid to increase pressure on the Caracas regime. ... The U.S. government is preparing to allege in criminal charges and sanctions that Venezuelan officials and private contractors, including a Colombian businessman, have laundered billions of dollars in state funds meant for the food program and other state operations, the officials and other people familiar with the matter said.\"\n\n-- Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 may now be forced to consider negotiations with President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. From the New York Times's Anatoly Kurmanaev: \"Both sides have sent representatives to Norway for talks, a concession Mr. Guaid\u00f3 previously rejected. This change is a turning point for the opposition, which in January had gathered momentum, attracting broad international backing and huge crowds of supporters. Now, that momentum has nearly dissipated -- a testament to Mr. Maduro's firm hold on power even as the country crumbles around him.\"\n\n-- A U.S.-funded broadcaster meant to air objective Spanish-language news programs in Cuba failed to meet these basic standards, a review found. Aaron C. Davis reports: The broadcaster \"let an anchor describe Trump administration officials as the 'dream team' for Cuba policy, according to an independent review. The analysis of content aired and published by Radio and Television Mart\u00ed, a sister agency to the better-known Voice of America, was launched by the broadcasters' parent organization after reports that Mart\u00ed had aired anti-Semitic segments disparaging philanthropist and prominent Democratic donor George Soros. The review of Mart\u00ed content, conducted by Spanish-speaking academics and former journalists and released Tuesday, found the news organization routinely allows 'almost any criticism of the Cuban government and its leaders' on the air.\"\n\n-- Demonstrators in Indonesia clashed with police over President Joko Widodo's reelection. Stanley Widianto and Shibani Mahtani report: \"Thousands of protesters started gathering overnight in central Jakarta, after an official vote count showed Widodo had won over 55 percent of 154 million votes cast in the April election. This was his second win over his opponent, Prabowo Subianto, a former general who lost to Widodo in the last presidential election five years ago.\"\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Anita Hill says it would be a 'tragedy' if Democratic women aren't taken seriously as 2020 presidential candidates. The New York Times's Katie Glueck reports: \"'And I think if we don't take them seriously as presidential candidates, we are not going to hear those voices,' she said Tuesday night in an interview. 'And that would be a tragedy.' ... Ms. Hill said she finds it 'really, deeply troubling' that several of the female 2020 candidates have been discussed as vice presidential material. Both Senator Kamala Harris of California and Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost the race for Georgia governor last year, have been mentioned as possible running mates for [Joe] Biden over the past few months. ... Asked whether she was directing her comments at Mr. Biden, Ms. Hill replied: 'I don't know that it's just him. I think that that presumption about women as vice-presidential choices is not just about Joe Biden specifically, it's about Joe Biden as the front-runner.'\"\n\n-- North Korean media lashed out against Biden, calling him a \"snob bereft of elementary quality as human being.\" From Bloomberg News's Rita Devlin: \"'He is self-praising himself as being the most popular presidential candidate. This is enough to make a cat laugh,' the agency writes in a commentary piece that also denigrates Biden for his university grades and for falling asleep at a speech by President Barack Obama in 2011. KCNA also called the former vice president a 'fool of low IQ; and said he 'had the temerity to insult the supreme leadership' of North Korea at a recent campaign event.\"\n\n-- \"'How are you going to pay for it?' -- 2020 candidates wrestle with their costly plans,\" by the Los Angeles Times's Evan Halper: \"The economic argument against big government deficits is that the need to borrow money to pay the bills will crowd out private investment, driving up interest rates and, ultimately, [slow] economic growth. The fact that interest rates have remained persistently low despite rising deficits shows that's not happening.\"\n\n-- Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) ambitious agenda depends on a wealth tax that the rich might evade. Toluse Olorunnipa reports: \"Taken as a whole, the Massachusetts senator's transformative slate of social programs and tax increases could amount to the largest transfer of wealth from the richest Americans to the middle class in U.S. history. But Warren's ambitious agenda relies on two assumptions that defy a long history of U.S. policymaking: First, that the country's wealthiest taxpayers won't find ways to evade the targeted tax hike she proposes, and second, that new entitlement programs won't result in ballooning costs that plunge the federal government deeper into debt. 'She's gone big. There's nothing small about these proposals,' said Mark Zandi, who, as chief economist at Moody's Analytics, has analyzed policies for Warren and other presidential candidates. 'Will the wealthy do things that wealthy people can do to avoid paying the tax? That's the real concern that I have.\"\n\n-- New York Mayor Bill de Blasio's net approval is worse than Trump's. Philip Bump reports: A Quinnipiac Poll asked Democrats \"if there were any candidates that they hoped wouldn't win. About 10 percent of those surveyed identified both Biden and Sanders, the two front-runners. The next most commonly cited candidate? [de Blasio.] It's a pretty impressive feat that de Blasio's pulled off here. No one picked him as their preferred nominee, but one out of every 12 respondents said affirmatively that they didn't want him to win. Why? Well, de Blasio is really unpopular among the Democratic candidates. Fourteen percent of Democrats view him favorably, and 35 percent view him unfavorably, a net favorability of minus-21. That's substantially worse than any other Democratic candidate. ... de Blasio is less popular on net than President Trump.

After the Nazi genocide of six million Jews, some 20,000 Jewish displaced persons from Eastern Europe ended up settling permanently in West Germany, joining an unknown number of the roughly 15,000 surviving German Jews who still remained in the country after the war. ... This change, however, did not necessarily reflect an immediate conversion in longstanding anti-Semitic attitudes on the ground. In the decades that followed, a desire among many Germans to deflect or repress guilt for the Holocaust led to a new form of antipathy toward Jews -- a phenomenon that came to be known as 'secondary anti-Semitism,' in which Germans resent Jews for reminding them of their guilt, reversing the victim and perpetrator roles.\"\n\n-- \"How San Francisco broke America's heart,\" by Karen Heller: \"For decades, this coruscating city of hills, bordered by water on three sides, was a beloved haven for reinvention, a refuge for immigrants, bohemians, artists and outcasts.

Jack Young gives his acceptance speech after being sworn in as Baltimore's 51st mayor. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nBaltimore still isn't able to provide basic city services two weeks after a powerful ransomware attack. And a full recovery may take months, Mayor Bernard C. \"Jack\" Young says.\n\nThe damage includes police surveillance cameras that are shut down and utilities payment systems that were forced offline. Broad phone and email outages are also forcing city workers to do what work they can with personal laptops and email accounts, Ars Technica's Sean Gallagher reports.\n\nBaltimore's real estate market was effectively shut down for two weeks, leaving people unable to buy or sell homes before the city developed a paper-based workaround Tuesday, the Baltimore Sun's Ian Duncan reports.\n\nThe Baltimore damage highlights the far-reaching consequences of ransomware -- which hackers use to lock up a victim's computer systems and data and demand a hefty fine to release them -- on U.S. cities and the costs to American citizens.\n\nIt also raises the specter of how outdated city computer systems are vulnerable to even worse attacks. One of the greatest fears is that ransomware could affect emergency services -- including, say, crippling police and ambulances -- and endangering public safety. While those services were unaffected in the recent Baltimore attack, the city knows it's vulnerable because it's been hit before. A ransomware attack in 2018 shut down for several hours an automated system Baltimore emergency workers use to locate people who call 911 and pinpoint the nearest police car or ambulance.\n\nIt's a major problem across the U.S. There have been more than 170 ransomware attacks that hit state and local governments since 2013, according to the research firm Recorded Future. And once ransomware attackers realize they've compromised a city, they often \"take advantage of the fact by targeting the most sensitive or valuable data to encrypt,\" the Recorded Future report states.\n\nAnd there's a big financial cost no matter which direction city leaders choose. It's expensive either to pay the ransom, or stand up to them and deal with the eventual damage. Baltimore has been tight-lipped about how the attack occurred because the FBI is investigating it. But officials did say they refused to pay the ransom, which totaled about $100,000 in bitcoin.\n\nIn the best-known case, a ransomware attack against Atlanta -- which prosecutors pinned on Iranian government-linked hackers -- cost that city's taxpayers more than $9 million. The attack shut down online city services, required police and courts to file paperwork by hand and forced the city to halt court proceedings for anyone who wasn't already in jail.\n\nThe FBI now says it \"doesn't support paying a ransom.\" But that guidance came out following a backlash after a top official acknowledged the bureau sometimes did suggest companies pay if there was no better way to unlock their systems. According to Recorded Future, 17 percent of cities attacked with ransomware pay the ransom.\n\nCities are especially vulnerable to digital attacks because their IT systems tend to be older and more complex than those of private-sector organizations. And they're often struggling with tight budgets that result in too few staff charged with keeping those systems secure.\n\nThings are especially bad in Baltimore.\n\n\"According to a 2018 strategy document, Baltimore spends about half of what other cities budget for IT, and the Office of Information Technology only controls about 1 percent of the total budget,\" Sean reported. The city also burned through four IT chiefs who were all fired or forced to resign within five years before Chief Information Officer Frank Johnson took the helm in 2017, Sean reported.\n\nCybersecurity experts were quick to point out how that shortsighted IT management may cost the city a lot of pain in the future.\n\nHere's the Center for Democracy and Technology's Maurice Turner:\n\nAnd former NSA hacker Jake Williams:\n\nSome cities are trying to hedge against ransomware attacks by buying insurance that pays out in the event of cyberattacks. Baltimore, however, lacks that coverage, Sean reported. \"So the cost of cleaning up ... will be borne entirely by Baltimore's citizens.\"\n\nPINGED: The Trump administration is considering blacklisting another Chinese company from U.S. markets over digital spying concerns, my colleague David J. Lynch reports.\n\nThe possible move against Hikvision, the world's largest maker of video surveillance technology, comes less than a week after the Commerce Department added the Chinese telecom Huawei to a list that will restrict U.S. companies from selling it software or components. Commerce later granted companies a 90-day reprieve to finish up business with Huawei. \"Hikvision supplies surveillance cameras that the Chinese government has deployed throughout the Muslim-majority Xinjiang region to combat what it describes as separatist terrorism,\" David reported.\n\nThe company was among five Chinese firms Congress banned from selling to the government in a defense policy bill last year citing national security concerns. The others were: Huawei, ZTE, Hytera and Dahua.\n\nHuawei, meanwhile, is taking its case to European governments and describing the United States as a bully, the Wall Street Journal's Emre Peker and Dan Strumpf report. \"Now it is happening to Huawei. Tomorrow it can happen to any other international company. This is dangerous,\" Huawei's Vice President for the European Region Abraham Liu told reporters in Brussels, according to the report.\n\nEuropean governments may be receptive. They have a history of pushing back on U.S. pressure where Huawei is concerned and have been especially resistant to U.S. pleas to ban the telecom from their next-generation 5G wireless networks. \"Europe, along with the Middle East and Africa, generated 28 percent of Huawei's $107 billion in revenue last year and was the company's fastest-growing region,\" the Journal reported.\n\n\"European telecom companies -- which have used Huawei gear in their networks and often also sell Huawei smartphones -- have so far stuck by the company.

He defined the phenomenon as a pileup of small tweaks to the existing regime, all ignored by the public, that taken together will undermine a system intended to prevent another devastating recession. After the current regulators have \"moved on,\" he said, \"somewhere down the line, someone else will suffer that damage. In all likelihood, it will once again be the most vulnerable of households and businesses.\"\n\nThe speech, delivered at Americans for Financial Reform in Washington, amounted to a rare rebuke of Tarullo's successors from the man the Wall Street Journal once called \"the most powerful man in banking,\" and Wall Streeters themselves nicknamed \"the Wizard of Oz\" for his quiet power over their industry. (Read the speech here.)\n\nAnd it comes a week after two former Fed chairs and two former Treasury secretaries sounded a warning about how Trump's Wall Street watchdogs are minding their beat. In a letter last Monday, the former Fed chairs, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, and the former treasury chiefs, Tim Geithner and Jack Lew, criticized the decision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to stop subjecting to extra oversight non-banks including major insurers and asset managers. \"Though framed as procedural changes, these amendments amount to a substantial weakening of the post-crisis reforms,\" they wrote.\n\n\"What's most notable here is just that all of these regulators collectively think that now is the time to speak out,\" says Jeremy Kress, an assistant professor of business law at the University of Michigan and a crisis-era attorney at the Fed. \"Between what's going on at the Fed and FSOC, all the crisis-era regulators have had enough. And while they've generally maintained a low profile since leaving office, they've decided to put their personas behind substantive and serious critiques of these deregulatory proposals.\"\n\nTarullo focused in particular on stress testing, the exercise designed to determine whether banks have enough reserve capital to survive an economic collapse. He said the tests offer too many advance clues to banks, a change made in the name of transparency that will in fact allow banks to \"find clever ways to reshape their assets\" so they can maintain lower levels of capital without actually trimming risk. Tarullo also said a Fed proposal to create a new \"stress capital buffer\" to prevent banks from depleting their capital cushion with dividend payments could allow them to take on more risk, since it would exclude one of two standards used to calculate a bank's exposure.\n\nKevin Fromer, president of the Financial Services Forum, which represents CEOs of eight of the largest banks, suggested Tarullo's concerns are unfounded, because the biggest firms have more than an adequate capital cushion. \"I don't think there's any question the overall level of capital in these institutions is obviously higher, and the stress tests have demonstrated repeatedly that these institutions are extremely well capitalized and capable of lending in an extreme economic downturn,\" he said.\n\nBut Marcus Stanley, policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, which advocates tougher regulation of the industry, said Tarullo's critique highlighted how changes to the stress tests raise doubts about their reliability to ensure banks remain sound. \"For someone who is the architect of this system to come out publicly and say this isn't fine-tuning, and it's undermining the system, is quite significant,\" he said.\n\nIan Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, says the former regulators worked long and hard on the post-crisis rules, so it's \"understandable\" they now want to be on record opposing efforts to dial them back. Plus, Katz notes the industry appears to be gaining some traction on Capitol Hill: In the House, 26 Republicans recently wrote financial regulators pushing for more deregulation.\n\nYet he said his conversations with investors in the industry indicate they are more concerned with those firms outside the scope of strict federal oversight.\n\n\"I've had discussions with people who believe that the regulators, particularly the Fed, are still paying close attention to things like leveraged lending. But in the markets, to the extent people are concerned, they're more concerned about whats going on outside the regulated banking sector.\"\n\n-- Theresa May: Let Parliament vote on second Brexit referendum. The Post's Karla Adams: \"British Prime Minister Theresa May urged British lawmakers on Tuesday to back her 'new' Brexit deal, which would include a binding vote by Parliament on whether to hold a second Brexit referendum. In a speech in London, May said lawmakers will have \"one last chance\" to deliver Brexit in a vote early next month. But, more accurately, it probably will be May's last chance. She has signaled that she will step down if her thrice-rejected divorce deal fails again in the House of Commons, as it is widely expected to do.\"\n\nThe speech got panned. Per The Guardian: \"The Labour leadership insisted it did not represent a meaningful change and hard Brexit-supporting Tories and the DUP indicated they had little or no intention of voting for it. The People's Vote campaign also dismissed May's offer of a vote on a second referendum.\n\n-- Trump team eyes Fed critic Judy Shelton. WSJ's Nick Timiraos: \"Economist Judy Shelton, a potential nominee to the Federal Reserve, said in an interview that she would bring a different perspective to the central bank and press for a change in how it sets interest rates. Ms. Shelton has been interviewed by White House officials for a nomination to the Fed's board of governors and served as an informal adviser to [Trump's] 2016 campaign. She wrote critically in the weeks before that election about how the Fed's low- rate policies were boosting wealthy investors and corporations at the expense of working Americans and retirees with fixed incomes. On Tuesday, Ms. Shelton said she is no longer concerned about such perils because she believes the administration's fiscal policies have boosted growth and productivity.\"\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\n-- Xi speaks in subtext: Chinese President Xi Jinping didn't mention his country's trade war on Tuesday, but his actions show that he is ready for the long haul.\n\nPerspective: Rare earth materials may not be such a trump card.

Unlike oil and other raw materials, the need for a large and constant supply of many rare earth materials is also less important. Many products which use rare earths only require tiny amounts -- they have been described as 'the vitamins of modern technology' -- and therefore it will take time for them to be impacted by tariffs. The US also maintains stockpiles of many key rare earth materials, not least those used in the defense industry.\"\n\n-- The Trump administration targeted Huawei after China talks went south. \"The Trump administration held off on blacklisting Huawei Technologies Co. out of concern the move could disrupt trade negotiations with China and only took action after the last round of talks hit an impasse, according to people familiar with the matter,\" Bloomberg's Jenny Leonard, Nick Wadhams, and Margaret Talev report.\n\n\"Timing of the U.S. action raised questions about whether [Trump] is punishing the company in part to gain a negotiating edge with Beijing in a deepening clash over trade.

But its manufacturers usually use U.S., Japanese or Taiwanese microchips and other components. Beijing is developing its own suppliers to capture more of the industry's profits and reduce what the ruling Communist Party sees as a security risk in relying on foreign vendors.\n\nIntegrated circuits, or microchips, are among technologies China has targeted for state-led development in official plans that helped to ignite Beijing's tariff battle with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe United States, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those plans violate China's market-opening obligations. Chinese officials have offered to alter details but are unlikely to abandon a strategy they consider a path to prosperity and global influence.\n\nUnder the new measure, software and integrated circuit companies founded by the end of 2018 will owe no income tax for two years and the rate will be cut by half for three years after that, the Finance Ministry said.\n\nIts two-sentence statement gave no details. But the top economic official, Premier Li Keqiang, said May 8 policies to promote the industry would apply equally to foreign-financed and Chinese companies.\n\nBeijing has spent billions of dollars over the past two decades on research subsidies and importing technology, sometimes using tactics that have angered Washington and other governments.\n\nTrump vetoed the 2017 acquisition of an Oregon tech company, Lattice Semiconductor, after it became clear the buyer was financed by the Chinese government.\n\nPolitical analysts say the sense of urgency over reducing reliance on foreign technology increased after another telecom equipment maker, ZTE Corp., was nearly forced into bankruptcy last year by U.S. export controls.\n\nWashington imposed a seven-year ban on technology sales to ZTE over its exports to Iran and North Korea. Trump agreed to restore access after ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine and replace its executive team.\n\nAlso last year, the Trump administration imposed restrictions on technology exports to a state-supported Chinese semiconductor maker, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. The Commerce Department said Jinhua was developing the ability, possibly with U.S. technology, that threatens the viability of American vendors needed for military systems.\n\nOne measure of how far China needs to go to supply its own technology needs is industry analysts' warnings about how many U.S. suppliers may be battered by the loss of Huawei Technologies Ltd. as a customer. They include industry leaders Micron Technologies, Qualcomm, Qorvo, Skyworks Solutions, Xilinx, Broadcom and Texas Instruments.\n\nThe Trump administration's order last week will reduce or eliminate Huawei's access to American chips and Google, which provides the Android operating system and services for its smartphones.\n\nVendors are required to obtain government permission for technology sales to Huawei. The Commerce Department said it granted a 90-day exemption for some technology to minimize the impact on rural phone carriers that use Huawei equipment.\n\nHuawei, China's first global tech competitor, has developed its own chips for smartphones, servers and artificial intelligence.

(Kevin Dietsch/Pool/Bloomberg News) By David J. Lynch David J. Lynch Financial writer covering trade and globalization May 21 at 11:25 PM\n\nThe Trump administration is considering blacklisting another major Chinese technology company in a move that would broaden a U.S. campaign to sever China's access to American know-how and inflame a deepening trade conflict, according to an individual familiar with the debate.\n\nThough no final decision has yet been reached, the administration is preparing to move against Hikvision, the world's largest maker of video surveillance technology, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The deliberations were first reported by the New York Times.\n\nThe disclosure comes less than a week after the administration barred U.S. companies from supplying Huawei Technologies, perhaps China's most prominent manufacturer, without first obtaining a U.S. government license. The administration earlier this week relaxed the ban, saying it would grant temporary 90-day waivers for U.S. companies to help Huawei maintain its existing networks.\n\nU.S. officials are said to be eyeing the same penalty for Hikvision, using a Commerce Department mechanism known as the \"entity list.\"\n\nCiting national security considerations, Congress last year banned federal agencies from purchasing equipment made by Hikvision and four other Chinese technology companies: Huawei, ZTE, Hytera and Dahua.\n\nThe measure was triggered by \"classified information the committee reviewed in the course of our regular oversight activities,\" according to Claude Chafin, a spokesman for the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nHikvision supplies surveillance cameras that the Chinese government has deployed throughout the Muslim-majority Xinjiang region to combat what it describes as separatist terrorism.\n\nRandall Schriver, assistant secretary of defense for Asia, said earlier this month that the Chinese government is detaining 3 million Muslim Uighurs in reeducation camps. The authorities in Beijing describe the facilities as vocational training centers.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Cui Tiankai, China's ambassador to the United States, denied reports of human rights abuses. \"They are real training centers,\" he said. \"They are not camps. They have open gates. There's no armed guards. People could go home over weekend.\"\n\nHikvision last month reported earning about $1.65 billion on revenue of roughly $7.2 billion in 2018. In its annual shareholder letter, the company said it had faced numerous challenges last year but remained \"upbeat about growth in the domestic and overseas markets in the years ahead.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's intensifying campaign to limit China's access to advanced U.S. technologies comes as a year-long trade conflict defies hopes of an early settlement.\n\nDespite the president's continued pursuit of a trade deal, the administration has been cracking down on China in other realms. The Justice Department in December indicted two hackers who allegedly worked with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, targeting companies holding advanced technologies with military applications.\n\nThe Commerce Department is drawing up new regulations to restrict U.S. exports of 14 advanced technologies, including robotics and quantum computing, in a move motivated by concern over China's access to American innovations.\n\nSome Trump administration officials want to disconnect American investors and companies from Chinese companies that help beef up the Chinese military, \"Big Brother\" surveillance networks or those that benefit from China's alleged theft of U.S. trade secrets.\n\nLast year, the Commerce Department banned state-backed ZTE from doing business with American suppliers after the company violated the terms of an earlier enforcement action.\n\nBut the president reversed the ban, which would have crippled ZTE, after a personal plea from Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe episode illustrates that any move to sever Chinese companies' links to the United States might cause collateral damage to the U.S. economy. ZTE spends about $2.6 billion annually buying products from U.S. companies such as Qualcomm and Intel. Huawei also relies heavily on American suppliers.\n\nAdministration officials recognize that the greater the number and significance of Chinese companies affected by sanctions, the greater the pain for U.S. companies and their workers.\n\nEllen Nakashima in Washington contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pVUyJT8GdUI2MNx23mVkURNmBQw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M4WRZST4E4I6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4804044", "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 296198100}, {"uri": "1141886574", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-22", "time": "00:37:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-22T00:37:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8823529481887817, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/us/politics/hikvision-trump.html", "title": "Trump Administration Could Blacklist China's Hikvision, a Surveillance Firm", "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is considering limits to a Chinese video surveillance giant's ability to buy American technology, people familiar with the matter said, the latest attempt to counter Beijing's global economic ambitions.\n\nThe move would effectively place the company, Hikvision, on a United States blacklist. It also would mark the first time the Trump administration punished a Chinese company for its role in the surveillance and mass detention of Uighurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic minority.\n\nThe move is also likely to inflame the tensions that have escalated in President Trump's renewed trade war with Chinese leaders. The president, in the span of two weeks, has raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, threatened to tax all imports and taken steps to cripple the Chinese telecom equipment giant Huawei. China has promised to retaliate against American industries.\n\nHikvision is one of the world's largest manufacturers of video surveillance products and is central to China's ambitions to be the top global exporter of surveillance systems. The Commerce Department may require that American companies obtain government approval to supply components to Hikvision, limiting the company's access to technology that helps power its equipment.\n\nAdministration officials could make a final decision in the coming weeks.\n\nThe combination of more traditional surveillance equipment with new technologies, like artificial intelligence, speech monitoring and genetic testing, is helping make monitoring networks increasingly effective -- and intrusive. Hikvision says its products enable their clients to track people around the country by their facial features, body characteristics or gait, or to monitor activity considered unusual by officials, such as people suddenly running or crowds gathering.\n\nThe potential crackdown stems from the Trump administration's belief that China poses an economic, technological and geopolitical threat that cannot be left unchecked. The United States has targeted Chinese technology companies like Huawei that it believes could pose a national security threat given deep ties between the Chinese government and industry and laws that could require Chinese firms to hand over information if asked.\n\nAdding to those concerns are the global human rights implications of China's extensive surveillance industry, which it increasingly uses to keep tabs on its own citizens. The Chinese have used surveillance technology, including facial recognition systems and closed-circuit television cameras, to target the Turkic-speaking Uighurs, who have accused the Chinese government of discriminating against their culture and religion.\n\nChina has constructed what amounts to a police state in the country's northwest region of Xinjiang, which Uighurs consider their homeland. That includes extensive surveillance powered by companies like Hikvision and barbed wire-ringed internment compounds that American officials estimate hold 800,000 to as many as three million Muslims.\n\n[How China turned a city into a prison.]\n\nChina has begun exporting this technology to nations that seek closer surveillance of their citizens, including Ecuador, Zimbabwe, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\"Hikvision takes these concerns very seriously and has engaged with the U.S. government regarding all of this since last October,\" a Hikvision spokesman said in an emailed statement. \"In light of them, the company has already retained human rights expert and former U.S. ambassador Pierre-Richard Prosper to advise the company regarding human rights compliance. Separately, Hikvision takes cybersecurity very seriously as a company and follows all laws and regulations in the markets we operate.\"\n\nSince last year, administration officials have debated what to do about China's attempts to clamp down on the cultural and religious practices of the Uighurs. But they have refrained from taking action, in part because some American officials worried a move would derail attempts to win a trade deal with China.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with Fox News on May 2 that the administration was concerned \"that the Chinese are working to put their systems in networks all across the world so they can steal your information and my information.\" He mentioned the Muslim internment camps, adding, \"This is stuff that is reminiscent of the 1930s that present a real challenge to the United States, and this administration is prepared to take this on.\"\n\nSince trade talks with Beijing nearly crumbled early this month, the administration has quickly ramped up economic pressure on China. It is moving ahead with plans to tax an additional $300 billion in products, and announced a sweeping executive order cutting off Huawei from purchasing the American software and semiconductors it needs to make its products. While American companies can try to obtain a license to continue doing business with Huawei, firms like Google are making plans to curtail the products and services that they supply.\n\nThe administration is also attempting to prosecute a top Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, who faces criminal charges in the United States and is under house arrest in Canada, where she awaits a court decision on extradition.\n\nThe measure against Hikvision would operate similarly to Huawei's license requirement. The Commerce Department would place it on an \"entity list,\" which requires designated foreign companies and American companies to get United States government approval before they do business with one another.\n\n\"Taking this step would be a tangible signal to both U.S. and foreign companies that the U.S. government is looking carefully at what is happening in Xinjiang and is willing to take action in response,\" said Jessica Batke, a former State Department official who has done research in Xinjiang and testified before Congress on the issue. \"At the same time, however, the ongoing trade war perhaps undercuts the perception that this is coming from a place of purely human rights concerns.\"\n\nThe Commerce Department and the White House declined to comment.\n\nOn Wednesday, the China's foreign ministry urged countries to treat Chinese companies fairly.\n\n\"We have repeatedly stated that China opposes the United States's practice of abusing state power and arbitrarily discrediting and suppressing foreign enterprises, including Chinese enterprises,\" Lu Kang, a ministry spokesman, said at a regular briefing in Beijing in a response to a question about the possibility of blacklisting Hikvision.\n\nHikvision is little known in the United States, but the company supplies large parts of China's extensive surveillance system. The company's products include traffic cameras, thermal cameras and unmanned aerial vehicles, and they now allow Chinese security agencies to monitor railway stations, roads and other sites.\n\nIt is not immediately clear what effect a United States ban would have on Hikvision's business. The company appears to source just a small portion of its components from the United States, and any such ban could speed its efforts to switch to Chinese suppliers.\n\nBut Hikvision does have a growing international presence, and its executives have warned in the past about the potential for rising anti-China sentiment in the United States to affect its operations. The company says it has more than 34,000 global employees and dozens of divisions worldwide, and it has supplied products to the Beijing Olympics, the Brazilian World Cup and the Linate Airport in Milan. It has tried to expand into North America in recent years, employing hundreds of workers in the United States and Canada, setting up offices in California and building a North American research and development team headquartered in Montreal.\n\nIn a letter published in English in April, Hikvision's chief compliance officer said that the company was taking reports that video surveillance products had been involved in human rights violations seriously and had commissioned an internal review of its operations to enhance screening standards to better protect human rights. \"We are taking a hard look at our products and business,\" the officer, Huang Fanghong, wrote.\n\nMembers of Congress from both parties have called on the administration to impose sanctions on companies involved in aiding China's persecution of Muslims, including Hikvision. In an August 2018 letter, legislators also urged the Commerce Department to strengthen its controls over technology exported to these companies, and called on the government to increase disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies that might be complicit in human rights abuses.\n\nHikvision and Dahua, another company cited by lawmakers, are both listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange. MSCI, one of the largest index providers in the United States, added Hikvision to its benchmark emerging markets index last year. UBS and J. P. Morgan are among the company's top 10 shareholders, according to Hikvision.\n\nRepresentative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, said in an interview that the House Intelligence Committee, which he leads, could scrutinize more closely American companies that are investing in or partnering with Chinese firms that are building up the Chinese surveillance state.\n\nCongress and the administration have responded with other measures that may clamp down on Hikvision's business. Congress included a provision in its 2019 military spending authorization bill that banned federal agencies from using Chinese video surveillance products made by Hikvision or Dahua.\n\nThe Trump administration is also considering imposing sanctions on specific Chinese officials known to play critical roles in the surveillance and detention system in Xinjiang. These sanctions would be imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act. The highest-ranking official being considered for this type of targeted sanction is Chen Quanguo, a member of the party's Politburo and party chief of Xinjiang since August 2016.\n\nThe State Department and White House National Security Council support imposing the sanctions, but officials at the Treasury Department have pushed back, citing a desire not to upset the trade talks, even though those have bogged down. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has advocated maintaining strong business ties with China.\n\nThe Commerce Department is also working on new restrictions on the types of potentially sensitive American technology that can be exported to foreign businesses, which are likely to touch on artificial intelligence and 5G abilities.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/21/business/21DC-CHINATRADE-01/21DC-CHINATRADE-01-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4804044", "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 296181420}, {"uri": "1141858031", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "23:31:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T23:31:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5411764979362488, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-loves-walls-but-he-should-be-careful-about-a-digital-barrier-with-china/2019/05/21/7280a146-7c13-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html", "title": "Opinion | Trump loves walls. But he should be careful about a digital barrier with China.", "body": "By David Ignatius David Ignatius Columnist covering foreign affairs Columnist May 21 at 7:08 PM\n\nHuawei's name is often translated in English as \"Chinese excellence.\" The Trump administration last week embarked on a campaign to rebrand the tech giant, in effect, as a \"Chinese threat\" and check its expansion in the West.\n\nThe Huawei assault may be the Trump administration's most important long-term strategic decision, because it confronts China's technological challenge to the United States head-on. The goal is to prevent Huawei from dominating 5G wireless communications, the next phase of the digital revolution, by blocking use of its technology by the United States and its partners.\n\nPresident Trump's action was the digital version of a combat-mobilization order. Because of Huawei's alleged threat to U.S. national security, Trump put it on the \"Entity List,\" which forbids U.S. firms from selling technology to it without special permission. The impact was clear this week when Google announced that it would stop selling updates of its Android operating system for Huawei phones.\n\nThe wiring of the global economy is entangled, so the Commerce Department granted a 90-day delay, probably to allow Google to send security patches and other urgent fixes. Commerce, meanwhile, was given 150 days to draft rules that would block U.S. companies from buying Huawei equipment, though legal experts predicted that Huawei might successfully challenge that ban in U.S. courts.\n\nIt's a measure of Trump's erratic dealmaking style that the first question for many observers was whether the president was serious about banning Huawei, or whether he was simply applying more pressure to get his stalled trade deal. Trump backed off last year from a similar squeeze against ZTE, another big Chinese telecom company, after a personal plea from President Xi Jinping.\n\nTrump-watchers doubt he's bluffing this time. He recently told close advisers, \"We have to win the 5G fight, period,\" according to former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who attended the session. \"I don't think we have any choice,\" Gingrich told me, because the alternative to checking Huawei is Chinese dominance of digital infrastructure.\n\n\"Huawei is the poster child of China Inc.,\" argued Christopher Johnson, a former top CIA analyst who's now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"If this campaign is successful, we've demonstrated that Xi's whole narrative that China has created an alternative to the West is false.\"\n\nThe danger, Johnson cautioned in an interview, is that if Trump forces European allies to choose between the United States and China, \"You may not like their response.\"\n\nWorking with allies, never Trump's strong suit, will be crucial here. Right now, there's no good alternative to Huawei's 5G technology. Somehow, the United States needs to encourage catch-up work by South Korea's Samsung, Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson. Bizarrely, the administration didn't pre-brief allies on its Huawei plan.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies will applaud Trump's action. For a decade, they've warned that Huawei was creating a global platform for Chinese spying. \"These measures were taken in the nick of time, before 5G from Huawei became engrained in our technological society,\" argued one former senior CIA operations officer.\n\nBut Americans, and Chinese too, should think carefully about what's ahead. Analysts this past week talked of a technological \"decoupling\" and a \"digital Iron Curtain\" descending on the global economy. That sounds like a description of a world in which everyone would be worse off -- a mobilization for a conflict such as World War I, which historians now judge was unwise and unnecessary.\n\n\"We are stuck in a reactive game of tit for tat,\" warns a senior executive of a giant U.S. technology company. He says the United States must think carefully about \"what hybrid international order we are seeking, recognizing that it has to be one where we coexist with China as a major power.\" This executive's concern, shared by others, is that Trump is making decisions with big, long-term consequences for short-term political reasons.\n\n\"This is the kind of blunt and risky instrument one might employ as the last step on the escalatory ladder,\" said former deputy secretary of state William J. Burns in an interview. \"I worry that we've leaped over other, more targeted tools that could have addressed or mitigated specific concerns with less collateral damage.\"\n\nAs so often with Trump, the real question is what end state he seeks with his campaign of maximum pressure. What does success look like? Is it the destruction of Huawei as a 5G competitor or simply a reduction of its market reach? Does Trump want technology coexistence or a restoration of American dominance?\n\nTrump is about building walls. But he should be especially careful about this digital barrier, behind which the United States might stand while the rest of the world races forward.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\nThe Post's View: The Trump administration owes the public answers about its restrictions on Huawei\n\nJohn Pomfret: A deeper tech concern is at the core of the U.S.-Huawei spat\n\nTom Cotton and John Cornyn: Keep the Chinese government away from 5G technology\n\nThe Post's View: The Huawei indictment tells a story of deceit and corporate espionage\n\nJosh Rogin: On 5G, the United States is building Betamax while China builds VHS", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iTanp44oNT14l636QJ9hBQFVpd8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A4LPFWD4DEI6TJNTGTZ634JVDY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4801602", "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 296177460}, {"uri": "1141853250", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "23:21:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T23:21:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.3725490272045135, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/opinion/china-trump-trade.html", "title": "Opinion | China Deserves Donald Trump", "body": "A U.S. businessman friend of mine who works in China remarked to me recently that Donald Trump is not the American president America deserves, but he sure is the American president China deserves.\n\nTrump's instinct that America needs to rebalance its trade relationship with Beijing -- before China gets too big to compromise -- is correct. And it took a human wrecking ball like Trump to get China's attention. But now that we have it, both countries need to recognize just how pivotal this moment is.\n\nThe original U.S.-China opening back in the 1970s defined our restored trade ties, which were limited. When we let China join the World Trade Organization in 2001, it propelled China into a trading powerhouse under rules that still gave China lots of concessions as a developing economy.\n\nThis new negotiation will define how the U.S. and China relate as economic peers, competing for the same 21st-century industries, at a time when our markets are totally intertwined. So this is no ordinary trade dispute. This is the big one.\n\nFor it to end well, Trump will have to stop with his juvenile taunting of China on Twitter (and talking about how trade wars are \"easy\" to win) and quietly forge the best rebalancing deal we can get -- we probably can't fix everything at once -- and move on, without stumbling unthinkingly into a forever tariff war.\n\nAnd China's president, Xi Jinping, will have to recognize that China can no longer enjoy the trading privileges it has had over the last 40 years, so he'd be wise to curb his nationalistic \"no-one-tells-China-what-to-do\" bluster and look for the best win-win deal he can get. Because Beijing can't afford America and others shifting their manufacturing to \"ABC,\" Anywhere-But-China, supply chains.\n\nHere is how we got here: Since the 1970s, the U.S.-China trade relationship has been pretty constant: We bought China's toys, T-shirts, tennis shoes, machine tools and solar panels, and it bought our soybeans, beef and Boeings.\n\nAnd when the trade balance got too out of whack -- because China grew not only by hard work, by building smart infrastructure and by educating its people, but also by forcing technology transfers from U.S. companies, subsidizing its own companies, maintaining high tariffs, ignoring W.T.O. rulings and stealing intellectual property -- Beijing placated us by buying more Boeings, beef and soybeans.\n\nChina kept insisting it was still \"a poor developing country\" that needed extra protection long after it had become the world's largest manufacturer by far. Nevertheless, the relationship worked for enough U.S. companies enough of the time that the world's biggest incumbent superpower, America, accommodated and effectively facilitated the rise of the world's next largest superpower, China. And together they made globalization more pervasive and the world more prosperous.\n\nAnd then some changes too big to ignore set in. First, China under Xi announced a \"Made in China 2025\" modernization plan, promising subsidies to make China's private and state-owned companies the world leaders in supercomputing, A.I., new materials, 3-D printing, facial-recognition software, robotics, electric cars, autonomous vehicles, 5G wireless and advanced microchips.\n\nThis was a natural move for a China aiming to leap out of the middle-income ranks and to reduce its dependency on the West for high-tech. But all these new industries compete directly with America's best companies.\n\nAs a result, all China's subsidies, protectionism, cheating on trade rules, forced technology transfers and stealing of intellectual property since the 1970s became a much greater threat. If the U.S. and Europe allowed China to continue operating by the same formula that it had used to grow from poverty to compete for all the industries of the future, we'd be crazy. Trump is right about that.\n\nWhere he is wrong is that trade is not like war. Unlike war, it can be a win-win proposition. Alibaba, UnionPay, Baidu and Tencent and Google, Amazon, Facebook and Visa can all win at the same time -- and they have been. I'm not sure Trump understands that.\n\nBut I'm not sure Xi does, either. We have to let China win fair and square where its companies are better, but it has to be ready to lose fair and square, too. Who can say how much more prosperous Google and Amazon would be today if they had been able to operate as freely in China as Alibaba and Tencent can operate in America?\n\nAnd how much money did China save -- to subsidize its own companies -- when its military stole the plans for Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter and then made its own carbon copy, avoiding all the R & D costs?\n\nI repeat: Trade can be win-win, but the winning shares can be distorted when one side is working hard and cheating at the same time. We could look the other way when trade was just about toys and solar panels, but when it's about F-35s and 5G telecommunications, that's not smart.\n\nBut that's not all that is new and problematic. We now live in the age of \"dual use.\" In a dual-use world, \"everything that makes us powerful and prosperous also makes us vulnerable,\" noted John Arquilla, one of the top strategists at the Naval Postgraduate School.\n\nIn particular, 5G equipment like that made by China's Huawei, which can transfer data and voices at hyperspeed, can also serve as an espionage platform, if China's intelligence services exercise their right under Chinese law to demand access.\n\nIndeed, the controversy around Huawei shines a spotlight on this whole new moment: Huawei increasingly dominates the global market for 5G infrastructure, which used to be controlled by Ericsson and Nokia. America's Qualcomm is both a supplier of chips and software to Huawei and a global competitor.\n\nBut the Chinese government has curbed competition against Huawei in China -- by both foreign and Chinese companies -- to enable Huawei to grow bigger, more quickly and cheaply. Huawei then uses that clout and pricing power to undercut Western telecoms and then uses its rising global market dominance to set the next generation of global 5G telecom standards around its own technologies, not those of Qualcomm or Sweden's Ericsson.\n\nMoreover, in a dual-use world, you have to worry that if you have a Huawei chatbot in your home, an equivalent of Amazon's Echo, you could also be talking to Chinese military intelligence.\n\nIn the old days, when we were just buying China's tennis shoes and solar panels and it our soybeans and Boeings, who cared if the Chinese were Communists, Maoists, socialists -- or cheats? But when Huawei is competing on the next generation of 5G telecom with Qualcomm, AT&T and Verizon -- and 5G will become the new backbone of digital commerce, communication, health care, transportation and education -- values matter, differences in values matters, a modicum of trust matters and the rule of law matters. This is especially true when 5G technologies and standards, once embedded in a country, become very hard to displace.\n\nAnd then add one more thing: The gap in values and trust between us and China is widening, not narrowing. For decades, America and Europe tolerated a certain amount of cheating from China on trade, because they assumed that as China became more prosperous -- thanks to trade and capitalist reforms -- it would also become more open politically. That was happening until about a decade ago.\n\nFor the last decade, though, said James McGregor, one of the most knowledgeable U.S. business consultants in China and a longtime resident there, it's been clear that Beijing, instead of \"reforming and opening, has been reforming and closing.\"\n\nInstead of China getting richer and becoming more of a responsible stakeholder in globalization, it was getting richer and militarizing islands in the South China Sea to push the U.S. out. And it was using high-tech tools, like facial recognition, to become more efficient at authoritarian control, not less.\n\nAll of this is now coming to a head in these trade talks. Either the U.S. and China find a way to build greater trust -- so globalization can continue apace and we can grow together in this new era -- or they won't. In which case, globalization will start to fracture, and we'll both be poorer for it.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

McCarthy pressed lawmakers to strip out language that could have prevented the company in his district, BYD Motors, from winning federal contracts, and they relented because they feared imperiling the bill.\n\nBYD Motors is a division of BYD Co., a giant Chinese manufacturer. Among other things, it makes electric buses that are often used by local governments. Stella Li, BYD Motors president, is a campaign contributor to McCarthy, and the lawmaker spoke at a ribbon-cutting for BYD's California plant in 2017.\n\nLawmakers frequently take a stance on legislation that could affect campaign contributors or hometown companies. But McCarthy's intervention was striking because the close ally of President Trump sought to protect Chinese interests at a time when Trump and many lawmakers on Capitol Hill are attempting to curb Beijing's access to U.S. markets, particularly in industries deemed vital to national security. Just last week, Trump put Chinese telecom giant Huawei on a trade \"blacklist\" that severely restricts its access to U.S. technology.\n\n[China's Huawei says it has long prepared for America's assault]\n\nMcCarthy's move to protect a Chinese company's interests frustrated even some members of his own party because they have warned repeatedly that allowing Chinese-backed firms access to U.S. infrastructure systems could pose a national security risk. Lawmakers of both parties have complained that U.S. tax dollars should not be used to support projects that benefit foreign companies.\n\n\"Kevin McCarthy has been championing a Chinese-owned company that is utilizing our tax dollars to gain a foothold in the American automotive industry,\" said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a labor-business partnership that has advocated for a tougher approach with China. \"This is a company that is clearly championed by the Chinese government, that has ambitions to dominate the global auto market, and so giving a foothold to it in the American transit market .\u2009.\u2009. seems to be a really, really risky proposition.\"\n\nMatt Sparks, a spokesman for McCarthy, defended the congressman's actions. He said McCarthy has long advocated for companies in his district, and he denied any connection between McCarthy's receipt of campaign contributions from BYD and his actions on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"McCarthy is proud to support job creation for his constituents and community,\" Sparks said.\n\nMcCarthy's work on the transit issue affecting BYD began last year and continued for several months, culminating in a February spending bill that omitted the ban on Chinese-backed companies getting federal transit contracts.\n\nBYD officials initially contacted McCarthy's office because the Senate had approved such a prohibition, which would have applied to bus or rail manufacturers supported by the Chinese government and prevented them from winning state or local contracts that use Federal Transit Administration dollars, as such contracts often do. Sparks confirmed that McCarthy's aides listened to the issues BYD raised about the bill.\n\nA House version of the bill, which McCarthy supported, exempted bus manufacturers from the prohibition, according to McCarthy's office -- a key provision that would have protected BYD. Senate negotiators wanted their broader, bipartisan restrictions pushed into the final law, but McCarthy objected, according to three officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks.\n\nUltimately, all of the proposed restrictions were scrapped because the impasse threatened to cause another government shutdown. Supporters of the stricter Senate version said the goal was to safeguard U.S. national security and domestic manufacturing.\n\n\"I think we're right to try to protect America's national security interests but also protect our domestic producers against that sort of unfair competition,\" said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), an author of the Senate provision.\n\nTrump and his top aides have complained that China unfairly subsidizes large companies in a way that puts American firms at a disadvantage, but there has never been a full accounting of how much U.S. government business those firms reap.\n\nThe enterprises are either partially owned by the Chinese government or receive financial support from it, and critics say those direct or indirect subsidies give them an unfair advantage over U.S. manufacturers. The Trump administration has engaged in broad trade negotiations with China that have soured in recent weeks -- in part over the issue of China's extensive network of government-backed enterprises.\n\n[As Trump escalates China trade dispute, economic ties lose stabilizing force in matters of national security]\n\nBeyond economic concerns, lawmakers from both parties have argued that it is dangerous for Chinese-linked firms to have access to U.S. transit systems because of the potential for espionage or other threats to national security. Among other things, they have said that in time, China-backed companies could use facial-recognition technology or other means to surveil unsuspecting Americans.\n\n\"We really need to wake up. We need to understand what a threat this is and do something about it,\" Rep. Daniel Lipinski (D-Ill.) said last Thursday at a House Transportation Committee hearing about public transit and rail sectors. \"We can't just sit here and talk about it and then years from now when it happens say, 'Well, I remember talking about it.'\u2009\"\n\nA BYD official who testified Thursday insisted that the company is not controlled by the Chinese government, noting that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns a stake in the firm.\n\nThe official -- Zachary Kahn, North America government relations director for BYD Motors -- emphasized BYD's civic ties to the towns of Lancaster and Palmdale in and near McCarthy's inland Southern California district, including support for the Boy Scouts and the California Poppy Festival. He said BYD employs 775 union members as part of its U.S. workforce, most of whom work at the Lancaster plant.\n\nFast Company last year called BYD \"The Biggest Electric Vehicle Company You've Never Heard Of.\" Forbes in 2017 listed BYD's billionaire chairman and president, Wang Chuanfu, as one of the richest men in China.\n\nThe company has promoted its ties to McCarthy in the past.\n\nAt an October 2017 ribbon-cutting to expand its Lancaster plant, McCarthy was seated on the stage next to the billionaire, according to a photograph posted on BYD's website.\n\n\"I am proud that BYD has chosen to expand their facility here in Lancaster,\" the website quotes McCarthy as saying. \"As BYD continues to develop cutting edge technology that helps transform the transportation industry here in the Antelope Valley and around the country, this investment will help create jobs in our community, keep Lancaster on the forefront of technological advancement, and put emission-free vehicles on our streets.\"\n\nOne month before the event, BYD's Li made several political donations that benefited groups tied to McCarthy, according to the Federal Election Commission. She gave $1,350 to Kevin McCarthy for Congress, $2,700 to California Victory 2018 and $1,350 to the Great America Committee.\n\nLi had never given McCarthy or either of the political action committees money before that time, according to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nFrank Girardot, spokesman for BYD Motors, said the donations were made as part of a political fundraising event, and he disputed any impropriety.\n\n\"If you're going to characterize this as being some kind of influence type thing, nothing could be further from the truth,\" Girardot said.\n\nThe Great America Committee is a political action committee affiliated with Vice President Pence that supported many Republican House candidates in the last campaign cycle. It did not give money to McCarthy, but it did support many of the GOP candidates McCarthy backed in an effort to retain control of the House. California Victory 2018 is a PAC that gives money to California Republicans, with McCarthy being the biggest individual beneficiary last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that studies political donations.\n\nSparks, the McCarthy spokesman, said the congressman had been familiar with issues related to BYD for several years.\n\n\"McCarthy's awareness of BYD's proposal and decision to build a plant in Lancaster long preceded this event. In fact, McCarthy met with the mayor of Lancaster to discuss the BYD proposal and tour potential sites back in 2015,\" Sparks said. \"The BYD investment in the Antelope Valley helps the city of Lancaster -- which is in the congressman's district -- work toward its ambitious goal to be a zero-net energy city.\"\n\nBYD has faced scrutiny for years. Some Democrats have accused it of manufacturing batteries for its vehicles in China and then shipping the unfinished products to the United States, where they are put in a special casing and labeled in a way that allows them to qualify under \"Buy America\" restrictions. The Buy America designation is crucial for the company to qualify for certain contracts funded by U.S. taxpayer dollars.\n\nBYD officials have denied accusations that they aren't properly following the rules, insisting that the company's buses meet or exceed Buy America requirements.\n\n\"BYD stands by its products and its U.S. employees,\" Kahn told lawmakers Thursday, adding, \"This competitive dynamic supported by BYD's presence in the U.S. has also driven down costs for transit agencies.\"\n\n[As Trump fights with China over trade, U.S.-China economic relationship already being redefined]\n\nWinning contracts with state and local governments has been crucial for BYD since it expanded its presence in the United States. Several media reports have projected that the company has received hundreds of millions of dollars in such contracts in recent years.\n\nLast year, for example, the company won one bid to supply the city of Atlanta with electric vehicles and another to provide battery-electric buses for Georgia, according to BYD's website.\n\nLawmakers at the House hearing were unimpressed. Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.) said BYD has received $338 million in grants from the Chinese government, and three of its five board members are connected to the Chinese government in some way.\n\nMitchell asked Kahn for details on the terms of the grants and other information about the company's organization, which Kahn was mostly unable to supply.\n\n\"Whether this is technically state-owned or state-influenced, we have a problem here,\" Mitchell told him. \"What's been made abundantly clear by the Chinese government is they plan to assume a dominant position in the world by 2025 in all aspects, including economic. This is a threat to the security of this nation, so let's not dress this up and say that BYD is not state-owned.\"\n\nHouse Transportation Committee Chairman Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) complained at the same hearing that BYD sent defective buses to his district, but he also acknowledged the company's political savvy.\n\n\"They're smart, they unionized, they put these plants in very strategic places,\" DeFazio said. \"They didn't know Democrats were going to take over the House; they put the plant in Kevin McCarthy's district. I think they would have put it in someone else's district if they'd known Democrats were going to take over the House, but they aren't dumb.\"\n\nIn an interview after the hearing, Kahn was asked whether BYD had chosen to move into Lancaster because it is represented by a powerful member of Congress. He said he wasn't with the company at the time, but his sense was that the local mayor was its biggest supporter.\n\nAnd Kahn said the company did nothing untoward in approaching McCarthy and other local representatives about the problematic spending bill language.\n\n\"We certainly let all of our representatives know when there's legislation that would hurt us, let them know the implications of something like that,\" Kahn said. \"Most transit agencies do use federal funding, hence it would be really damaging to jobs in his district.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7CpyU7PTT4XGSuDAU6HUUVuu5Uc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NBDK22T3DEI6TJNTGTZ634JVDY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4803630", "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 296174160}, {"uri": "1141808343", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:50:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:50:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/world/asia/china-canadian-arrested.html", "title": "China Arrests 2 Canadians on Spying Charges, Deepening a Political Standoff", "body": "BEIJING -- Two Canadian men detained in China since December have been formally arrested on espionage charges, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Thursday, a move likely to ratchet up tensions between China and Canada that broke out with the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Vancouver.\n\nMichael Kovrig, a former diplomat who was detained while visiting Beijing, was arrested on suspicion of \"gathering state secrets and intelligence for abroad,\" and Michael Spavor, a business consultant who was detained in northeastern China, was accused of \"stealing and providing state secrets for abroad,\" Lu Kang, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, said at a regularly scheduled news briefing.\n\nThe vague reference to unspecified overseas entities left open the question of whether the men were suspected of working for a government or for some other organization.\n\nMr. Lu did not provide further details and said only that the arrests had been made recently.\n\n\"Everything in China is done in accordance with law,\" Mr. Lu said.\n\nResponding to a reporter's question about Canadian officials' criticism of how China handled the cases, he said: \"We hope Canada will not interfere with or comment casually on China's legal system and lawful practices.\"\n\nCanada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, criticized the initial detentions of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor as \"arbitrary\" and politically motivated; on Thursday, Global Affairs Canada, the country's foreign ministry, denounced their arrests.\n\n\"Canada strongly condemns their arbitrary arrest as we condemned their arbitrary detention,\" Brittany Fletcher, a spokeswoman for Global Affairs Canada, said in an emailed statement. \"Canada continues to express its appreciation to those who have spoken in support of these detained Canadians and the rule of law.\"\n\nSupporters of the two men and foreign legal experts have said their detentions appeared to be retaliation for the arrest in Canada in December of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, China's biggest telecommunications company.\n\nMs. Meng was arrested at the request of the United States, which wants to extradite her on fraud charges.\n\nMr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor were seized by the police in December, days after Ms. Meng was arrested while changing planes in Vancouver. The Chinese government was incensed by Ms. Meng's arrest, and the charging of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor makes it more likely that they will face trial and conviction, deepening the standoff with Mr. Trudeau's administration.\n\nMany in Canada have reacted with consternation at China's treatment of the two Canadians, who have been denied access to lawyers and been confined in secret detention centers, without visits from family members. Canadian diplomats have been allowed to visit them about once a month.\n\nMr. Lu, the foreign ministry spokesman, did not respond to questions Thursday about where the two men were being held.\n\nTheir circumstances are a striking contrast to those of Ms. Meng, who is out on bail, has been living in Vancouver in a six-bedroom home valued at 6 million Canadian dollars, and is free to roam largely about the city with a GPS tracker on her ankle.\n\nIn addition to the diplomatic tensions, the Meng case and detentions of the two Canadians have fueled economic tensions between the two countries.\n\nChina, which bought about $2.7 billion worth of canola oil from Canada last year, recently halted shipments of Canadian canola oil, saying they were contaminated.\n\nAccording to the Canada China Business Council, which promotes business, trade and investment between Canada and China, 20 percent of Canadian companies have been adversely affected by the dispute as demand from China for Canadian products shrinks.\n\nA former Canadian ambassador to China, Guy Saint-Jacques, said the formal arrest of the two men signaled a worsening in relations with China and would make it even more challenging for Canada to secure their release.\n\n\"In 95 percent of cases the accused are found guilty, and this formal arrest signals the gravity of the situation,\" he said. \"We are in for a long period of difficulties with China in which pressure from the Chinese will increase.\"\n\nMr. Saint-Jacques said that while China's economic might outweighed Canada's, Canada could retaliate by taking action against China at the World Trade Organization over the canola issue, and by rallying its allies internationally to make it clear to China that its actions against the two Canadians came at a price.\n\nBut he also added that the hope by some in Canada that improved trade relations between the United States and China could help clear the way for the men's eventual release had diminished given the intensifying friction between the two countries.\n\nHuman rights advocates on Thursday denounced the arrests of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor.\n\n\"Their cases show again how the Chinese criminal system violates the human rights of detainees,\" said Patrick Poon, a researcher for Amnesty International in Hong Kong. He called on Chinese officials to release the men, absent \"credible and concrete evidence\" of crimes.\n\nBefore the latest announcement, Chinese officials had signaled that Mr. Kovrig and Spavor could be charged with espionage offenses.\n\nMr. Kovrig worked for the United Nations and the Canadian foreign service before 2017, when he joined the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization that tries to defuse conflicts between states.\n\nHe focused on Chinese foreign policy, Asian regional politics and North Korea, and was often quoted in foreign news outlets and invited to meetings in China.\n\nMr. Spavor was a consultant for companies and people interested in North Korea, including Dennis Rodman, the former basketball star who has befriended the North's leader, Kim Jong-un.\n\nMr. Spavor was detained in Dandong, the Chinese city on the North Korean border where he was based.\n\nIn early March, a legal affairs committee within China's ruling Communist Party said investigators believed that Mr. Kovrig had been \"stealing and spying to obtain state secrets and intelligence,\" and that Mr. Spavor had supplied him with information.\n\nBut China's definition of state secrets can be sweeping and opaque, and the International Crisis Group has said Mr. Kovrig's work for it was in no way nefarious.\n\n\"Nothing Michael did was harmful to China,\" the group's president, Robert Malley, said on Thursday. \"On the contrary, his work helped inform both China's global policies and those around the world who make policies toward China in a manner that contributes to preventing and resolving conflict.\"\n\nThe cases of Ms. Meng and the two Canadians are playing out as the United States is pressuring allies not to use Huawei's technology, arguing that China could use it to spy on other countries.\n\nThose efforts intensified on Wednesday, when President Trump moved to ban American telecommunications companies from installing foreign-made equipment that could pose risks to national security. The measure seemed aimed at blocking sales by Huawei, though it did not explicitly single out any nation or company.\n\nCanada's security agencies have been undertaking a national security review to determine whether Huawei's technology should be used as Canada develops its 5G telecommunications network.\n\nIn January, American prosecutors indicted Ms. Meng and Huawei, laying out what they said were efforts by the company to steal commercial secrets, obstruct a criminal inquiry and engage in bank fraud while trying to evade American sanctions on Iran.\n\nHuawei has denied breaking the law, and the Chinese government has repeatedly said that the charges were politically driven.\n\nThe Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, said at a news conference in early March that the case against Huawei and Ms. Meng was \"by no means a purely judicial case, but rather a deliberate political case\" intended to bring down Huawei.\n\nMr. Trudeau and Canadian and United States officials have said that the case against Ms. Meng is a legal matter, not a political one. But President Trump veered from that position in December, when he suggested that he could intervene in the case if that helped to seal a trade agreement with China.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_buckley@nytimes.com", "name": "Chris Buckley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/15/world/16China-canada-promo/15CANADA-DETAINEES-COMBO-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 296171400}, {"uri": "1141791846", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:20:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4705882370471954, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/world/asia/us-china-trade-war.html", "title": "U.S.-China Trade Standoff May Be Initial Skirmish in Broader Economic War", "body": "WASHINGTON -- A yearlong trade war between the United States and China is proving to be an initial skirmish in an economic conflict that may persist for decades, as both countries battle for global dominance, stature and wealth.\n\nProgress toward a trade agreement nearly collapsed this past week, with both sides hardening their bargaining positions. And even if a trade deal is reached, it may do little to resolve tensions between the world's two largest economies.\n\nThe United States is increasingly wary of China's emerging role in the global economy and the tactics it uses to get ahead, including state-sponsored hacking, acquisitions of high-tech companies in the United States and Europe, subsidies to crucial industries and discrimination against foreign companies.\n\nThe Trump administration has begun trying to limit China's economic influence in the United States and abroad, warning about China's ambitions in increasingly stark terms. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, compared China's ambitions to Russia and Iran in a speech in London last Wednesday, saying Beijing poses \"a new kind of challenge; an authoritarian regime that's integrated economically into the West in ways that the Soviet Union never was.\"\n\nThe United States has been erecting barriers to limit Chinese investment in American companies, re-examining the kinds of technology that can be exported to China and restricting China's role in building America's next-generation telecommunications networks, while also discouraging other countries from using Chinese equipment.\n\nThe F.B.I. has increased its scrutiny of Chinese researchers in the United States over fears they may be acquiring intellectual secrets. A Justice Department initiative is targeting commercial espionage of American technology, and earlier this year the United States unveiled a sweeping indictment of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, over accusations of stealing trade secrets and evading American sanctions on Iran.\n\nChina, whose ambition is to dominate industries of the future, is pushing back. A column on Saturday in the Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper stated, \"The United States is again waving the club of tariffs after misjudging China's strength, capacity and will, further escalating trade friction between our two countries.\"\n\nThe piece was written under the pen name Zhong Sheng -- the \"voice of China\" -- a name used when the paper publishes comments on foreign affairs that are authoritative.\n\nRestraining China's ambitions and methods is a tricky task -- and there is concern that the Trump administration's effort is creating a new red scare, fueling discrimination against China and its citizens that could ultimately hurt the United States. As many as 30 Chinese professors have had their visas to the United States canceled in the past year, or been put on administrative review, according to Chinese academics and their American counterparts.\n\n\"We've got decades of painful negotiating with China ahead,\" said David Lampton, a China scholar at Stanford University. Mr. Lampton said a trade deal, if reached, would do little to resolve the bigger conflict. \"It's just a skirmish in an ongoing battle.\"\n\nChinese negotiators returned to Beijing over the weekend without a trade agreement and with even larger economic barriers between the two countries. The Trump administration raised tariffs on $200 billion in exports on Friday and said it would move ahead with the legal process of taxing another roughly $300 billion of products at the same 25 percent rate.\n\nThe two countries could yet come to an agreement that opens opportunities for businesses and rolls back the levies they have placed on each other. Both American and Chinese officials said on Friday that they would continue to talk and could meet in Beijing next month. Liu He, China's vice premier, called the failure to reach a deal \"just a small setback in the talks between two countries,\" while Mr. Trump, in a tweet, described the talks as \"candid and constructive.\"\n\nWhile a trade deal could calm some tensions and establish more good will between the two nations, it is unlikely to achieve many of the ambitious goals that the administration has set for itself. Mr. Trump's advisers, in particular the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, have been focused on what the administration calls China's practices of \"economic aggression.\"\n\nBut the administration has struggled to address the immensity of the problems in the text of a trade deal. People close to the talks say that the negotiators appear powerless to force any changes that aren't in China's interest.\n\nMr. Liu, who is leading China's team in the trade negotiations, hinted at that uphill battle in a video statement released by the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n\"Now both sides have reached consensus in many respects, but frankly there are also areas of disagreement,\" he said. \"We believe that these are major matters of principle, and any country has its own important principles -- we can't make concessions on matters of principle.\"\n\nDespite punishing tariffs already on nearly half of Chinese exports to the United States, Beijing is still resisting many of the most significant changes that the administration seeks. It has been reluctant to roll back subsidies for advanced manufacturing industries or to make public commitments to stop cybertheft.\n\nInstead, a trade deal between the two countries seems more likely to bring change around the margins -- tens of billions of dollars of soybean purchases, some tariffs lifted and changes to the text of Chinese laws or regulations that the country might ultimately disregard, particularly once another administration occupies the White House.\n\n\"This is a decades-long endeavor,\" said Robert Daly, the director of the Wilson Center's Kissinger Institute on China and the United States. \"This can't be waved away over cake at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nThe notion that the United States has one last shot to change China's behavior is held by an array of people on both sides of the political spectrum. But it is an aggressive notion of American power to upend a rival system that has delivered prosperity for its people and put China on course to be the world's largest economy.\n\nMany in China see the United States as a declining power bent on enforcing its will on a world that no longer cowers before its hegemonic might. The troubles in American democracy and the long economic slump after 2008 persuaded many in China that its instincts to chart its own course were correct. In the eyes of many Chinese, their country is simply reclaiming its historic status as a dominant regional power in Asia.\n\nIt has also projected power across Asia, Africa and elsewhere while the United States has, on many fronts, retreated from its post-World War II commitment to the global order. But it has done so with little application of military force, in sharp contrast to what many in China see as American militarism.\n\nMany in China have sought to avoid a trade conflict, which could have a larger impact on their economy than the United States'. But they have long thought the United States would have a difficult time accepting a true peer in economic, technology and military power, so consider the management of conflict with the United States to be an inevitable result of their own rise.\n\nWhile the Trump administration accused China of breaking a trade deal, China's resistance to the emerging terms stemmed from its belief that the United States was asking too much and offering too little in return. Many of the changes the United States seeks would limit what Chinese officials regard as a tried-and-true approach of using tens of billions of dollars from state-owned banks and government investment funds to turn previously small industries like car production or solar panel manufacturing into the largest industries of their kind in the world.\n\nAnd the Chinese view some of the Trump administration's demands as infringing on their sovereignty and giving America too much power over their economy -- including requiring the country to codify changes through legislation in the National People's Congress. To the increasingly nationalistic public in China, the American requests are reminiscent of 19th century history of unequal treaties forced on the country by foreign powers.\n\nMr. Trump on Saturday suggested China was simply delaying a deal in the hopes that a Democrat would win election in 2020 and continued his pugilistic approach, saying \"the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term. Would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting BIG TARIFFS!\"\n\nIn the United States, China's unwillingness to bow to America's demands is uniting lawmakers like the Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.\n\nThat is a significant shift from the prevailing view in the United States since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 that close economic engagement with China would produce an increasingly democratic country that would be closely tied to an international economic order founded mainly on Western liberal ideals.\n\nThat has not happened.\n\nChina has indeed grown in prosperity, leaping into the ranks of what the World Bank defines as upper-middle income countries. Its economy is now bigger than any other country except the United States. Its manufacturing sector is now bigger than those of the United States, Germany and South Korea combined.\n\nBut in the last five years, China has veered toward increasingly repressive authoritarianism at home and a rapid military buildup. The State Department estimates that Beijing has put 800,000 to two million Muslims in hastily built internment camps ringed with barbed wire in northwestern China. The Chinese government has built an archipelago of air bases on artificial islands in the South China Sea in between Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. And China now has the world's largest navy and has conducted military exercises as far away as East Africa and the Baltic Sea.\n\nOn the economic front, the competition is even fiercer. Trump administration officials warn that China is trying to dominate the global 5G infrastructure that will be the basis for future mobile communications and is competing to set other technological standards that will determine which global companies win.\n\nChina is extending low-cost loans and building infrastructure around the globe through its One Belt, One Road program, which critics warn is making poorer countries beholden to China. It is out-investing the United States in some high-tech industries, and is gaining dominance in certain segments, like mobile payment, new energy vehicles and areas of artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile American companies have long hankered for access to China's growing market, their position has begun to shift as they see China's practices and treatment of foreign companies. A survey released by the American Chamber of Commerce in China in February showed that the majority of its members favored retaining tariffs on Chinese goods while trade negotiations continued.\n\nChina's own experts say that the Beijing leadership has been caught off guard by the pace of change in American perceptions of Sino-American relations.\n\n\"Even if there is some kind of agreement between Xi and Trump, in the long run the strategic bilateral relationship is already in trouble,\" said Zhang Jian, a professor in the School of Government at Peking University. \"There is no coming back, even if there is a deal.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/12/us/12dc-tradewar-sub-2/merlin_153827598_526c0d28-e557-4511-a8da-a90f4aa0af0b-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4800969", "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 296169600}, {"uri": "1141780920", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:02:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:02:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/technology/huawei-ban-president-trump.html", "title": "Trump's Latest Move Takes Straight Shot at Huawei's Business", "body": "BEIJING -- The Trump administration has filed criminal charges against Huawei for stealing technology. It has all but snuffed out the Chinese tech giant's sales in the United States, calling the firm an espionage threat. And it has tried to persuade other governments to do similarly.\n\nBut Washington had not taken a straight shot at Huawei's ability to do business anywhere in the world until late Wednesday, when the Commerce Department announced restrictions on the company's access to American technology.\n\nAmerican companies including Qualcomm, Intel and Broadcom sell Huawei microchips and other specialized parts that go into its smartphones and telecom equipment. Google's Android software powers its phones. Of the $70 billion that Huawei spent on components and other supplies last year, $11 billion went to American companies, a Huawei spokesman, Joe Kelly, said.\n\nIf Huawei is cut off from these suppliers, the effect could be catastrophic for the millions of people who use Huawei smartphones -- and for the mobile networks, across a wide swath of the planet, that run on Huawei gear.\n\nIt would be \"the trade equivalent of a nuclear bomb,\" said Kevin J. Wolf, a partner at the law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and an assistant secretary of commerce under President Barack Obama.\n\nMuch remains unclear, however, about the scope and potential impact of the Commerce Department's move. The department says it is putting Huawei on its \"entity list\" of firms that need special permission to buy American components and technology. How it decides to grant such permissions, and how broad a range of products the policy covers, will determine how badly Huawei's business is disrupted.\n\nAccording to a notice posted to the Federal Register on Thursday, licenses for selling to Huawei and 68 affiliated companies around the world will be reviewed with a \"presumption of denial,\" indicating they will likely be hard to obtain. The notice is scheduled to be officially published in the Federal Register on Tuesday.\n\nGiven the spiraling tensions between China and the United States on tariffs, the move against Huawei may also be short-lived. Talks to resolve the trade fight have stalled, and both sides are digging in their heels. The pressure is on to find common ground ahead of a potential meeting next month between President Trump and China's top leader, Xi Jinping, in Japan. Washington's campaign against Huawei could become a bargaining chip.\n\n\"In every other administration, the entity listing was purely a tool of law enforcement and national security,\" Mr. Wolf said. \"The thing to watch is whether this will become a tool of trade policy and used as leverage in the negotiations.\"\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Huawei said the Commerce Department's move was \"in no one's interest.\"\n\n\"It will do significant economic harm to the American companies with which Huawei does business,\" the company said, and \"affect tens of thousands of American jobs.\"\n\nChina's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Commerce condemned Washington's decision in regularly scheduled news briefings on Thursday.\n\n\"We urge the United States to stop these wrongful practices and to create favorable conditions for normal cooperation between the two nations' companies,\" said Gao Feng, a spokesman for China's Commerce Ministry.\n\n[Read more about the executive order on foreign-made equipment.]\n\nTensions between the Trump administration and Huawei escalated after American officials arranged the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the company's chief financial officer and a daughter of its founder, in Canada late last year. The company and Ms. Meng face criminal charges in the United States in connection with alleged theft of industrial secrets and violations of sanctions against Iran. Ms. Meng remains in Canada while officials there decide whether she will be extradited.\n\nWashington's action this week against Huawei puts the company in the same position that ZTE, a much smaller Chinese rival in telecom equipment, found itself in a few years ago.\n\nThe Commerce Department added ZTE to the entity list in 2016 after determining that it had violated United States sanctions by selling American-made goods to Iran. Eventually, the department relented, and ZTE agreed to a hefty fine. But a year later, the Commerce Department said ZTE had failed to comply with the terms of the agreement, and American technology companies were barred outright from selling to the company.\n\nCut off from American microchips and other parts, ZTE halted production and was near collapse until President Trump intervened and softened the punishment to appease the Chinese leadership.\n\nThe episode galvanized China's government and business community. It revealed the extent to which the country's growing technological prowess had been built on American know-how, and how important it was for China to innovate on its own if its economy was to thrive.\n\nHuawei also got a stark demonstration of the power Washington wielded over it.\n\nThe company has since stockpiled components \"for uncertain times,\" Guo Ping, a Huawei deputy chairman, told reporters in March. The firm has also worked to build up a geographically diverse network of suppliers, Mr. Guo said.\n\n\"Huawei has made sustained and deep investments over the past 30 years, and I believe that has been of great help to Huawei's global supply,\" he said.\n\nIn particular, the company has invested for many years in producing its own microchips, a key area in which most Chinese firms are laggards. Sravan Kundojjala, an analyst based in Hyderabad, India, with the technology research firm Strategy Analytics, estimates that three-quarters of the smartphones that Huawei ships today contain chips developed in-house.\n\nMr. Kundojjala acknowledges that he was skeptical when Huawei's semiconductor unit, HiSilicon, began building its own high-end smartphone chips.\n\n\"Initially, I thought this was not going to work out,\" he said. \"It's maybe a pet project. Maybe they just want to play games with their suppliers.\"\n\nInstead, HiSilicon has become a formidable asset for Huawei, with chip technology that analysts say rivals that of market leaders such as Qualcomm.\n\nYet Huawei still depends on American suppliers for enough critical components that an all-out export ban from Washington would create a sizable headache, even if it does not lead to near-ruin as it did for ZTE.\n\n\"When you've got something as complicated as a router or a cellphone, even if there's one part you're not able to get, you can't deliver, because you don't have that widget to make the cellphone or router function,\" Mr. Wolf, the lawyer, said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "raymond_zhong@nytimes.com", "name": "Raymond Zhong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/16/business/16HUAWEI-2-promo/16HUAWEI-2-promo-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v3.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 296168520}, {"uri": "1141780917", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "21:02:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T21:02:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/technology/san-francisco-facial-recognition.html", "title": "The Week in Tech: Putting an A.I. Genie Back in Its Bottle", "body": "Each week, we review the week's news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nHi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news:\n\n\"The facial recognition genie, so to speak, is just emerging from the bottle,\" Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, wrote in December, when he called for regulation of the technology.\n\nSan Francisco just put it back in.\n\nOn Tuesday, the city's Board of Supervisors banned the use of facial recognition software by the police and other city agencies in an 8-to-1 vote. Supporters said its use by government was an invasion of privacy incompatible with healthy democracy. Departments will now need to first submit proposals and post public notices to use the technology. Private-sector and federal use isn't affected.\n\nThat the ban was introduced by San Francisco, a city pivotal to the development of the technology, was viewed by some as a siren call. \"This is like Detroit banning a certain model of vehicle because it's too dangerous,\" said Alvaro Bedoya, a visiting professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center. \"You may not live in Detroit, but, boy, you'd think twice before getting in that car.\"\n\nExpect more cities to follow: Somerville, Mass., outside Boston, is considering something similar, and Brian Hofer, a paralegal who drafted the San Francisco ordinance, is pushing for other anti-surveillance measures across California.\n\nLike it or not, it's a rare sign that technologies viewed as threats to citizens' well-being can be blocked. \"The decision refutes a defeatist and widespread opinion that once a technology is established, you can't stop it in its tracks,\" said Evan Selinger, a philosophy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology.\n\nMore than an app fight\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court allowed an antitrust class action lawsuit against Apple, giving consumers an opportunity to try to prove that the iPhone maker used monopoly power to raise prices of iPhone apps.\n\nAs my colleagues Adam Liptak and Jack Nicas reported, the lawsuit focuses on the fact that Apple charges developers a commission of up to 30 percent for selling products through its App Store, bars them from selling the apps elsewhere and plays a role in setting prices.\n\nApple claims that it is a middleman: that customers buy software from the app developers. But the court, in a 5-to-4 ruling, said iPhone owners had a \"direct purchaser\" relationship with Apple, so they had the right to sue.\n\nIt's interesting that the decision went against Apple at all. Liberal jurists often favor antitrust action, and conservatives avoid it. So you'd have expected the verdict to be 5-to-4 in the other direction, along the conservative-liberal line of the Supreme Court.\n\nBut the new justice, Brett M. Kavanaugh, tipped the other way.\n\nYou could read Justice Kavanaugh's decision as an indicator that, as people of all political stripes begin to find Big Tech troublesome, conservatives may accept that antitrust could be a useful tool in curbing its power. If that's accurate, Big Tech should be very concerned.\n\nBreaking up Facebook? Godspeed\n\nIn 2019 there's little more fashionable than calling for Facebook's dismantlement.\n\nThis past week, Senator Kamala Harris and Joseph R. Biden Jr., two of the Democrats running for president, said it should be considered, joining another, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has called for wider Big Tech breakups. And don't forget that Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, wrote this month that he wanted its split up, too.\n\nWe could argue (at length) about the validity of the idea. But how plausible is it?\n\nThe weapon of choice behind most of these calls is antitrust law. Fine. There's plenty of potentially anticompetitive behavior to go after. But in terms of end results, a breakup is possible, but by no means certain, from such legal action, according to antitrust experts I spoke with.\n\nEiner Elhauge, a Harvard law professor who was chairman of the antitrust advisory committee to the Obama campaign in 2008, told me that splitting WhatsApp and Instagram from Facebook -- the most popular proposal -- was plausible but might depend on how deeply integrated they had become.\n\n\"It's hard to unscramble eggs,\" he said. And Facebook's push to intertwine the platforms more closely may make such unscrambling only harder.\n\nHarry First, a law professor at New York University who specializes in antitrust, said breaking up what then remained of Facebook would be \"problematic and expensive,\" making it unlikely.\n\nMore skeptical was Diana L. Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, who said that for any antitrust action, \"the remedy has to be applied specifically to the harm; it cannot be a broad remedy.\" That means that \"it may not even include breaking up the company,\" but would instead involve something less severe, like conduct requirements.\n\nMr. First agreed that injunctions and the formal monitoring of conduct were \"much more likely\" outcomes than a breakup.\n\nSo if an antitrust argument is used to break up the social network, it's not guaranteed to have the desired outcome. But, as Mr. First told me, for those who want it, \"it's good to have a goal.\"\n\nTrump's social media priorities\n\nOn Wednesday, more than a dozen countries, including Britain, France and Germany, signed a nine-point plan with big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter to address extremist and violent content. A notable absence: the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration cited free-speech protections for not signing, saying that \"the best tool to defeat terrorist speech is productive speech.\"\n\nThe same day, the White House unveiled a bias reporting tool that enables people to report, to the government, censorship that they believe is a result of political bias on social networks. That thrusts into the public domain a widely held view among Republicans that platforms like Facebook and Twitter censor conservative viewpoints.\n\nAs my colleague Kevin Roose pointed out, that looks like a savvy collection tool for voter data. But it's also an interesting, if not particularly surprising, demonstration of the priorities of the Trump administration.\n\nSome stories you shouldn't miss\n\n\u25a0 Uber bombed its I.P.O.

The move, a response to the Trump administration's order last week, could hamstring Huawei by restricting its access to future versions of the Android operating system. Google will also limit access to popular applications like Maps, Gmail and the Google Play store in new handsets made by Huawei, the world's second-largest smartphone maker, behind Samsung.\n\nBut Huawei was given a temporary reprieve from Google's abrupt pullback by the Commerce Department, which last week had added Huawei to a list of companies deemed a national security risk, effectively preventing it from buying or licensing American parts and technology without special permission from Washington. Late Monday afternoon, the department said in a notice posted to the Federal Register that it would grant 90-day permissions for transactions necessary to maintain and support existing cellular networks and handsets.\n\nGoogle said that it would work with Huawei during the 90 days to provide security updates to its Android operating system, but that it planned to abide by the Commerce Department's orders when the period expired.\n\nChip makers have also started stepping back from dealings with the Chinese firm. The German supplier Infineon said on Monday that it would restrict its business with Huawei. And Intel and Qualcomm, two of the world's largest chip makers, have told employees to cease working with the Chinese company until further notice, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe mass flight of American technology companies from Huawei, one of China's proudest corporate champions, is a stark escalation in the high-tech battle that has simmered between the two powers for years.\n\nChina has long prevented many American internet giants from providing services within its borders, and it has placed tight strictures on how other American technology firms can operate. The enormous commercial potential of the Chinese market made it hard for the companies to put up much of a fight as Beijing declared, in effect, that their business interests were subservient to China's national security interests.\n\nNow, the United States government is showing that it, too, has ways of getting foreign companies to play by its rules in the name of upholding national security. Its asset is not a giant, untapped market for technology products, but the technology itself -- the know-how and capabilities without which Huawei would not have achieved so much of its success.\n\n\"We have made substantial contributions to the development and growth of Android around the world,\" Huawei said in a statement about Google's pullback. \"As one of Android's key global partners, we have worked closely with their open-source platform to develop an ecosystem that has benefited both users and the industry.\"\n\nThe company's decision to halt work with Huawei was earlier reported by Reuters. Intel declined to comment, and Qualcomm did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMajor American wireless companies have effectively been blocked from buying Huawei's telecommunications equipment for years, but the company's business has grown rapidly in Africa, Asia and Europe, where its affordable prices have been embraced by consumers and by phone companies that use its antennas, base stations and other hardware to make wireless networks.\n\nIn recent months, the United States has stepped up its campaign against Huawei, which it has said poses a national security risk. American authorities have worked to persuade allies like Britain and Germany to block the use of Huawei telecommunications equipment. But the efforts have had limited success, as many countries rely on Huawei gear in the race to build up fifth generation, or 5G, wireless communication networks.\n\nLast week, President Trump issued a ban prohibiting American telecommunications firms from installing foreign-made equipment that could threaten national security. The order instructed the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, to stop transactions \"posing an unacceptable risk.\" Although the order did not single out specific companies, it was widely believed to be directed at Huawei and others in China's tech sector.\n\nThe actions put pressure on American allies that have so far resisted urging from the Trump administration to issue complete bans against Huawei. James Lewis, a senior vice president and the director of the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that most European countries would prefer a softer approach.\n\n\"I don't think Europeans realize the extent of the strength of feelings in the U.S. that we need to block Huawei,\" Mr. Lewis, a former official at the State and Commerce Departments, said.\n\nChina has not said whether it plans to retaliate against the United States in response to Mr. Trump's move. On Monday, shares in Qualcomm, Infineon, Intel and Alphabet, Google's parent, all fell. Apple, which depends on the Chinese market for a large portion of its revenue, also dropped amid concerns that the tech battle between the two powers made it a potential target.\n\nThe Chinese government also suggested the possibility of a legal challenge against the Trump administration order on Monday. Asked about Google's decision at a regularly scheduled news briefing on Monday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said, \"China encourages Chinese companies to take up legal weapons to defend their own legitimate rights.\"\n\nFor now, the flight of tech suppliers will test the durability of Huawei's business, which has long depended on access to products from American companies. It is now on the verge of reliving a run-in that another Chinese tech company, ZTE, had with Washington not long ago. To Chinese leaders and business executives, that episode remains a vivid cautionary tale of the United States government's ability to weaponize American companies' technological superiority for political ends.\n\nThat incident also began with a listing by the Commerce Department. ZTE, which competes with Huawei in telecom equipment, was determined to have sold American-origin goods to Iran. The department added the company to the entity list in 2016, putting a cloud over its future.\n\nIn time, ZTE negotiated a lighter sentence with the department, and its business with American suppliers was allowed to continue unrestricted. But last spring, commerce officials said the company had not disciplined the employees responsible for the transactions that had violated American export controls -- and that the company had lied to American authorities about it.\n\nWashington cut ZTE off from all purchases of American components and technology. Within weeks, the company was at death's door. Production stopped. Workers idled in their dorms.\n\nHuawei is a much larger company than ZTE, with a bigger global footprint. If it is brought to its knees as ZTE was last year, then the consequences could be devastating for smartphone users and mobile networks across a far wider stretch of the planet.\n\nIf the Commerce Department's order goes into full effect as currently stipulated, Google's change will apply to new Huawei devices and future versions of the Android operating system. Security and feature updates will still be available for Huawei users with Google apps already loaded on their devices.\n\nBy adhering to the Commerce Department's order, Google would undercut ties with an important and fast-growing partner. Huawei's smartphone sales in the year's first quarter grew 50 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, even as the broader handset market stagnated, according to the market research firm IDC.

Google's software powers Huawei's smartphones, and its apps come preloaded on the devices Huawei sells around the world. Depending on how the White House's order is carried out, that could come to a stop.\n\nFor Huawei, the big impact will be abroad, since Chinese customers already have limited access to Google's services. Google's move will have its biggest effect in places like Europe, where it has emerged as a big smartphone seller. Other companies will inevitably follow. In effect, the move puts pressure on Huawei's international expansion dreams.\n\nIf China and the United States have begun a technological Cold War, then the Huawei order can best be seen as the beginnings of a digital Iron Curtain. In this potential vision of the future of technology, China will continue to keep out much of the world. The United States and many other countries, goes this thinking, will in turn block Chinese technology.\n\nThe tougher American stance is closing off many of the ways that the United States and China exchanged ideas and did business despite the strict Chinese censorship regime. Those closed doors could have profound effects not only on the business of technology, but also on how the world will use and understand the devices and services of the future.\n\nAlready, China's censorship and tight control of its citizens' digital lives have effectively isolated one-fifth of the world's internet-using population, giving rise to a generation that doesn't know what it means to Google something or to subscribe to a YouTube channel.\n\nThe aggressive new stance by the United States will only speed up that process, opening a potential window to a day when Chinese people can use only Chinese phones and gadgets powered by homegrown chips and software. All this is happening with a speed that has shocked many in China.\n\n\"The move by the Trump administration is much more comprehensive than many Chinese expected,\" said Nicole Peng, an analyst at technology research firm Canalys. \"It also came much earlier. Many people only realize now that it's for real.\"\n\nIt is far from clear whether the Trump administration's moves will truly isolate Huawei from the rest of the world. The White House has struggled to persuade other countries to stop buying Huawei's telecommunications equipment, citing potential espionage concerns. (Huawei denies that it spies for the Chinese government.) Huawei has already developed its own chips and other capabilities, and has said that it has stockpiled equipment for a day when it would lose access to American know-how and equipment.\n\nThe attack on Huawei is also taking place against the backdrop of a worsening trade war, making it one piece on a larger game board. Just as it did last year, when the White House relented on a similar order that crippled Huawei's rival ZTE, the United States could lift its pressure on Huawei to ease tensions between Washington and Beijing.\n\nChina has ways it could retaliate. On Monday, China's state media reported that Xi Jinping, China's top leader, visited a site that mines and processes rare earths, which are essential minerals for a number of manufacturers in low-carbon technologies. His visit was a none-too-subtle reminder that China has a commanding presence in rare earths and could shut off global supplies -- something it has done once before.\n\nThe digital Iron Curtain has been long in the making. From its earliest days dealing with the internet, the Chinese government has squelched content it didn't like. Today, the Chinese internet at first glance doesn't look much like the one the rest of the world uses. It has different platforms, ideals and business strategies, all tended carefully by censors.\n\nBut the wall was mostly one-sided. American chips and software power Chinese servers and mainframes. China has been a big revenue driver for Apple, Oracle, Intel, Qualcomm and other big names in tech. Much of this was by necessity, since China couldn't make all this stuff itself, but it still gave American companies a role in the direction of the Chinese digital future.\n\nThe ties go deeper. Many of the founders of China's most successful technology companies were educated in the United States. American investors helped them get established, and some of those Chinese companies turned around and invested in American companies. Academics from the two countries regularly teamed up and swapped notes.\n\nNow the United States, concerned about securing intellectual property, is working to block some of those channels. It has tightened limits on Chinese investment in American companies. Some Chinese students who focused on science and technology have had problems getting visas to the United States. Some Chinese scholars have had their American visas revoked over spying fears.\n\nWith the Huawei limits, the Trump administration cited safety. The Commerce Department announced last week that it had placed Huawei and its dozens of affiliates on a list of firms deemed a risk to national security. The listing will prevent Huawei from buying American parts and technologies without seeking United States government approval.\n\nThe executive order, issued after trade talks with China collapsed this month, could ripple through all parts of Huawei's business. It has said American suppliers account for nearly one-fifth of its procurement spending. Even small parts could be crucial. Nobody wants to buy a high-end Huawei router that is only 95 percent complete.\n\nBut in international expansion, companies like Google give Huawei a common platform for customers outside China. Its phones come loaded with Google Play, the app and media store, as well as popular apps like Gmail and YouTube. Its license to use Android gives Huawei access to security updates and new features.\n\nWithout Google's cooperation, Huawei would have to come up with its own version of Android or use its own homegrown operating system. Many customers in places like Europe would rather not deal with that fuss. China has been trying to build its own operating systems over the past three decades but has not had much success.\n\nIn China, many people see the American moves as a naked ploy to stop a rising Chinese competitor. The United States can't beat Huawei's innovation and moxie, goes this thinking, so it will use the power of government to keep a Chinese rival down.\n\nOthers in China point to the country's own barriers against competitors as a strategy that was going to provoke retaliation sooner or later. At some point, the United States was bound to use reciprocity in dealing with a closed Chinese internet market. One popular blog post explained that reciprocity has been translated into \"mutual benefit\" in Chinese, which explains why many in China didn't understand that the idea could be used in retaliation.\n\nAnother popular blog post drives the point even more clearly.\n\n\"You've been opposing the U.S. for many years,\" said the headline. \"You should be long prepared that the U.S. will oppose you one day.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "li_yuan@nytimes.com", "name": "Li Yuan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/20/world/20oneworld/20huawei-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 296168160}, {"uri": "1141744091", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "20:00:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T20:00:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/technology/huawei-china-us-trade.html", "title": "U.S. Restrictions on Huawei Expose a High-Tech Achilles' Heel for China", "body": "BEIJING -- For all of China's efforts to become a global force in high technology rivaling the United States, it has mostly failed to produce top-flight contenders in one crucial area: the industry that gave Silicon Valley its name.\n\nLast year, China imported more than $300 billion worth of computer chips, the backbone of all digital products. That is more than it spent on crude oil from abroad.\n\nWashington has now turned China's reliance on American microchips against Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant that the Trump administration has labeled a national security threat. The Commerce Department last week restricted American firms from selling components and technology to the company, essentially cutting Huawei off from Google software, Qualcomm chips and more.\n\nThe department said Monday that it would allow Huawei to continue doing business with American suppliers for 90 days to prevent disruption to mobile networks that use the company's equipment. Yet Washington's move still strikes at a national soft spot for China that has weighed on the minds of the country's leaders for decades.\n\nDesperate to reduce the dependence on imports, the authorities in China have pledged tens of billions of dollars to help foster homegrown chip champions. The country's dreams of semiconductor hegemony have added to the trade tensions with the United States, which wants Beijing to scale back what it considers unfair government support for Chinese firms.\n\nWashington has found reason to directly punish one state-backed chip maker, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Company. After Micron Technology, an American rival, accused the Chinese company of pilfering chip designs, the Commerce Department blocked it from buying American components.\n\nThe fruits of China's chip drive have been mixed at best. Chinese firms' market share remains modest in most areas of semiconductor production. Nearly all of the most complex chips must still be imported. Several Chinese state-backed makers of memory chips, which store data, have announced big production plans. But the global market for such chips is currently saturated, suggesting grim prospects for turning a profit.\n\nOn the whole, government support has helped the Chinese industry, said Gu Wenjun, chief analyst at ICwise, a semiconductor market research firm in Shanghai. \"But now that the market has become overheated and fickle, the negative effects are increasingly apparent,\" he said.\n\nLocal governments in China \"don't understand the industry,\" Mr. Gu said. They are merely using up resources that private companies know how to spend more effectively, he added.\n\nChina's role as the world's leading assembler of electronics, and its vast consumer market for electronics, has convinced some observers that given enough time, the country would inevitably attract or foster the knowledge for producing advanced chips. If China could catch up in making toys and then in producing cellphones, the thinking goes, then why not in semiconductors someday?\n\nFor now, surviving without American chips promises to be the ultimate test for Huawei, despite the company's recent strides in developing its own processors.\n\nIn an interview with Chinese media on Tuesday, Huawei's founder and chief executive, Ren Zhengfei, said that in \"peaceful times,\" half of Huawei's chips came from American companies, and the other half it developed itself. Huawei has stockpiled chips for emergencies like this, Mr. Ren said.\n\nBut the company could never entirely reject American technology, he said. Even members of his own family, he said, are iPhone users.\n\n\"We will not recklessly get rid of American chips,\" Mr. Ren said. \"We need to grow together.\"\n\nBeijing's angst over foreign semiconductors has a long pedigree.\n\nAs Japan, South Korea and Taiwan emerged with formidable chip industries in the 1980s and '90s, China experimented with various forms of state planning to develop its own abilities. In 2014, Beijing set a goal of becoming a global leader in all segments of the chip industry by 2030, and national and local government semiconductor investment funds began springing up across the country.\n\nThe results of those efforts are hard to spot, however, in the innards of leading Chinese tech companies' products.\n\nTo crack open one of Huawei's smartphones or cellular base stations is to see the extent to which advanced technology is a truly globalized endeavor, even as Beijing and Washington have come to distrust each other's tech providers.\n\nIn Huawei's new P30 Pro flagship phone, for example, American firms supply a number of key components, including parts that help process the radio signals that carry calls and data through the air, according to an analysis by System Plus Consulting, a research firm in France.\n\nThe P30 Pro's memory chips are from Micron and the Japanese company Toshiba. The camera technology is from Sony of Japan. The processor, the brains of the phone, was developed by Huawei itself.\n\nHuawei's semiconductor division, HiSilicon, has surprised industry observers with the progress it has made in developing processors and baseband chips, which connect phones to data networks. Yet even HiSilicon may be affected by the Commerce Department's restriction. Many of the leading providers of chip design software are American.\n\nFor other kinds of components, Huawei should not have much trouble finding non-American substitutes if it is fully cut off from American suppliers. In memory chips, for instance, Micron is a leading global supplier, but so are Samsung and SK Hynix of South Korea.\n\nIn general, the more advanced the silicon, the more likely it is that Huawei will have to compromise on quality to avoid American providers like Broadcom, which supplies specialized chips for Huawei's data centers, and Nvidia, which makes high-end graphics processors for Huawei's laptops.\n\nThe company's options may also be limited when it comes to the critical components that help smartphones process radio signals. American companies, including Skyworks and Qorvo, lead the market for these \"radio frequency\" parts, which are technologically demanding to produce.\n\n\"It's just very difficult unless this is your bread and butter,\" Liam K.

Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, is out on bail awaiting extradition hearings and living in her two Vancouver mansions.\n\nKovrig and Spavor have been held since Dec. 10 and haven't had access to lawyers or family.\n\nCanadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said her Chinese counterpart hasn't agreed to talk with her.\n\n\"We're not the first country to find itself in this situation with China and the Chinese practice seems to be to avoid in the early stages of these kinds of standoffs, to avoid higher level meetings,\" Freeland told CBC's Metro Morning radio show.\n\n\"I have sought repeatedly a meeting with the Wang Yi, the foreign minister, my counterpart. Thus far that meeting hasn't happened. But if Chinese officials are listening to us today, let me repeat that I would be very, very keen to meet with Minister Wang Yi or to speak with him over the phone at the earliest opportunity.\"\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping but Freeland said during the recent U.S.-China trade talks -- at Trudeau's request -- the detained Canadians were raised by the Americans directly with the Chinese.\n\n\"This is a very difficult moment in the relationship between Canada and China,\" Freeland said. \"The detentions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are unacceptable.\"\n\nBut Freeland said Canada won't escalate the dispute.\n\n\"We do not escalate,\" she said. \"We would like this conflict to end, but we also do not back down.\"\n\nTrudeau said a news conference in Quebec that the Canadians are being held for political reasons and other nations are taking note of China's behavior.\n\n\"China is making stronger moves than it has before to try and get its own way on the world stage and Western countries and democracies around the world are pulling together to point out to that this is not something that we need to continue to allow,\" Trudeau said.\n\nChina has often retaliated against foreign governments and corporations in diplomatic disputes, but rarely by holding a foreign national. Beijing threatened \"grave consequences\" if Ottawa did not release Meng, shortly after she was detained in Vancouver in December for possible extradition to the U.S.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta of the District of Columbia opened his 41-page opinion with a lengthy quote from Buchanan complaining, in 1860, about the House opening an investigation into him.\n\n\"He maintained that the House of Representatives possessed no general powers to investigate him, except when sitting as an impeaching body,\" Mehta noted. \"Buchanan feared that, if the House were to exercise such authority, it 'would establish a precedent dangerous and embarrassing to all my successors, to whatever political party they might be attached.' Some 160 years later, President Donald J. Trump has taken up the fight of his predecessor.\"\n\nFor Mehta to lead with Buchanan, and such an explicit comparison to the current occupant of the Oval Office, is the judicial equivalent of what kids call a sick burn. Mehta's opinion goes on to offer a meaty history lesson for a president who has never cared much for the discipline. The judge cites Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton as he outlines why the House is entitled to the records it seeks. After recounting the Whitewater, Watergate and Teapot Dome investigations, Mehta concludes: \"This court is not prepared to roll back the tide of history.\"\n\n-- By any metric, Buchanan was one of our worst presidents. He was elected president in 1856. In the 1858 midterms, Republicans won functional control of the House with a plurality. But Democrats still held the Senate and the White House and controlled the Supreme Court. Washington descended into a gridlock far worse than what we know now. Sectional differences splintered Democrats between the North and South. Faced with Abraham Lincoln's likely victory in 1860, the proslavery \"fire-eaters\" advocated secession. Buchanan took the position that states didn't have the legal right to secede, but that there was nothing the federal government could do legally to stop them. He allowed the country to fall apart with a policy of inactivity during the transition. It took Lincoln's heroic leadership, four years and countless casualties to put down the rebellion.\n\n-- In addition to being feckless, the Buchanan administration was corrupt. Jasmin Bath, a historian of 19th-century political and economic culture, wrote a piece for the Outlook section last week about the committee that Buchanan was so angry about: \"Without Pennsylvania, Buchanan would not have gained enough electoral votes to win. Knowing this, state Democrats did what they could to get Buchanan into the White House, including using federal funds to finance their campaign. Although this was not uncovered until four years later, suspicions of payoffs and fraud tainted Buchanan's victory. ...\n\n\"In March 1860, a congressional committee made up of three Republicans and two Democrats began investigating. Nicknamed the Covode Committee after its chairman, John Covode, it produced a detailed majority report that exposed the crimes of the Democratic Party and the president himself. The sheer volume of corruption uncovered was startling. Although there was not enough evidence to impeach Buchanan, the report exposed extensive corruption that took place during his presidency: bribery, the disfranchisement of some voters in federal elections, abuses of printing contracts, subsidies for partisan presses from public accounts. The list went on and on.\n\n\"The committee's findings were released to the public in June 1860, just months before the presidential election, and proved to be incredibly damaging to the Democratic Party's reputation, even though Buchanan was not running again. Its detailed accounts of the misdeeds of the Democratic administration, which circulated throughout the North, gave the Republican Party substantial evidence with which to persuade the public that the United States could not afford the continued reign of the 'rotten and dishonest' Democratic politicians.\n\n\"Many contemporaries believed the Covode report had an impact on the results of the election. According to one Democratic campaign manager, August Belmont, 'the country at large had become disgusted with the misrule of Mr. Buchanan, and the corruption which disgraced his Administration' and the 'Democratic party was made answerable for [Buchanan's] misdeeds, and change was ardently desired by thousands of conservative men out of politics.' Even Southerners agreed. One slaver owner, Sidney George Fisher, argued that 'the corruptions and excesses of the administration were very influential in producing Republican victory.'\"\n\n-- Mehta outlined how reviewing financial records fits \"comfortably\" within Congress's broad powers. He said the legislative branch serves an \"informing function\" that boils down to the ability to expose corruption in the other branches. \"It is simply not fathomable that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct -- past or present -- even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry,\" wrote Mehta, who was appointed by Barack Obama.\n\n-- Trump called the decision \"crazy\" and promised to challenge it. \"We think it's totally the wrong decision by, obviously, an Obama-appointed judge,\" he told reporters.\n\n-- The judge gave Trump one week to formally appeal. \"The President is subject to the same legal standard as any other litigant that does not prevail,\" he noted.\n\n-- The ruling came down shortly after the White House officially blocked former counsel Don McGahn from testifying to Congress, releasing a memo from a Trump appointee at the Justice Department to justify the decision. \"The 15-page legal opinion written by Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel argues McGahn cannot be compelled to testify before the committee, based on past Justice Department legal opinions regarding the president's close advisers,\" Rachael Bade, Josh Dawsey and Devlin Barrett report. \"The memo says McGahn's immunity from congressional testimony is separate and broader than a claim of executive privilege. ...\n\n\"As a private citizen no longer in the government, McGahn is not necessarily bound by the White House directive ... [but his] lawyer, William A. Burck, said the former counsel would not testify. 'Mr. McGahn remains obligated to maintain the status quo and will respect the President's instruction,' Burck wrote. Testifying could jeopardize business and professional standing for McGahn, who works for Jones Day, a Republican law firm with close ties to the Trump campaign and electoral politics. Jones Day will still be involved in the reelection campaign but will have a reduced role from 2016, campaign officials say, when they were the main firm.\"\n\n-- Nancy Pelosi repeatedly cited Mehta's opinion last night during private sessions aimed at discouraging members of her own leadership team from breaking with her publicly on impeachment in the face of Trump's stonewalling vis-a-vis McGahn. \"Today we won our first case,\" she told a group of House Democrats, according to someone in the room. \"We've been in this thing for almost five months, and now we're getting some results. ... We still have unexhausted avenues here.\"\n\nAfter meeting privately with Pelosi last night, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler also mentioned Mehta's ruling as a reason not to jump the gun on impeachment. \"We have to enforce the right to our testimony through the courts, which is the only way you can do it,\" the New York Democrat told reporters staking out the speaker's office. \"And, right now, we're having very good success with it.\"\n\nBut at least five members of Pelosi's leadership team -- four of whom also sit on the House Judiciary Committee -- pressed Pelosi in a closed-door leadership meeting to allow the panel to start an inquiry. Bade and Mike DeBonis report: \"The meeting marks the first time a chairman and top rank-and-file lawmakers ... have lobbied her to change her long-held position on impeachment. Judiciary Committee members for days have discussed how to move the speaker toward their thinking, but few have been willing to break with her publicly. However, a core group of Judiciary Democrats plans to begin calling Tuesday for an impeachment inquiry if [McGahn] does not show for subpoenaed testimony. ...\n\n\"During the Monday night leadership meeting, Pelosi spoke about how Democrats' messaging isn't breaking through because everyone is talking about corruption, [Bob] Mueller's report and impeachment. She bemoaned the fact that last week the investigations were making page one news while the House's passage of the Equality Act -- a bill aimed at ensuring that gay, lesbian and bisexual people are not discriminated against -- was on 'Page 26.' That's when Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), chairman of a Judiciary subcommittee, jumped in to tell Pelosi that it amounted to a good case for launching an impeachment inquiry ... Raskin argued that such an inquiry would allow leadership to streamline and centralize all of the investigations into one. ... 'You want to tell Elijah Cummings to go home?' Pelosi said, referring to the House Oversight and Reform Committee chairman. ...\n\n\"During the leadership meeting, three other Judiciary Committee members -- [Rep. David] Cicilline (D-R.I.), Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and freshman Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) -- backed Raskin. ... Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), a fierce Pelosi defender and ally, grew angry and scolded the lawmakers that an impeachment inquiry would further distract from legislating. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos (Ill.) -- who has argued before that legislators should move on from impeachment talk -- pushed back as well, noting that when the DCCC asked voters in focus groups what topics they cared about, Mueller's inquiry ranked near the bottom.\"\n\n-- Trump relishes a fight and loves a good foil. House Democrats give him both. With his refusal to give an inch, Trump seems to be trying to goad Democrats into taking the next step. The White House is currently blocking more than 20 Democratic investigations into Trump, his finances or his policies.\n\n-- Even if House Democrats do decide to begin impeachment proceedings, a key factor that protects the president from being removed from office is that only one Republican in either chamber of Congress appears anywhere close to advocating his removal from office. Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) drew a primary challenger yesterday after he became the first Republican member of Congress to say publicly that Trump has committed impeachable offenses. The Detroit Free Press's Todd Spangler reports: \"State Rep. Jim Lower, R-Greenville, announced that he would run for the 3rd Congressional District seat Amash has held since 2011 and would forgo a race for a third term in the state House. Lower said he had been planning to run for some time and had expected to make an announcement closer to July 4.\"\n\n-- Amash has put his fellow congressional Republicans in a pickle. DeBonis and Bade report: \"Top Republican lawmakers and aides said Monday that kicking Amash out of the GOP conference or off his committee would only draw more attention to his apostasy. Instead, they have focused on isolating Amash and portraying him as an outlier. The House Freedom Caucus, a conservative group of which Amash is a member, also took a position Monday night 'strongly disagreeing' with Amash's comments.\"\n\n-- Harry Reid, battling pancreatic cancer in Las Vegas, said he shares Pelosi's concerns about political backlash from impeachment. \"Because you don't have to go very far to remember what happened. I mean, Clinton was impeached -- it helped him. I've been saying that for several months,\" the former Senate majority leader told the New York Times's Jonathan Martin. He narrowly held off a challenge in 1998 from John Ensign by 428 votes, perhaps thanks to voter unease with the GOP impeaching Clinton.\n\n\"I believe Jerry Nadler is handling things the right way,\" the 79-year-old added. \"I think the Mueller report deserves a full airing, I think that there should be witnesses, and I think that Trump better be very careful. Because if they're going to order McGahn and Mueller and others not to testify, I think that opens the door to impeachment. ... [The] trigger point is if they try to not allow people to come forward and testify.\"\n\nTHE CASE IS NOT CLOSED:\n\n-- Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, told a House panel earlier this year that Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow encouraged him to lie under oath and claim that negotiations for Trump Tower Moscow ended in January 2016. Tom Hamburger, Ellen Nakashima and Karoun Demirjian report: \"In fact, Cohen later admitted, discussions on the Moscow tower continued into June of the presidential election year, after it was clear Trump would be the GOP nominee. ...\n\n\"House Democrats are now scrutinizing whether Sekulow or other Trump attorneys played a role in shaping Cohen's 2017 testimony to Congress. ... Attorneys for Sekulow said in a statement that 'Cohen's alleged statements are more of the same from him and confirm the observations of prosecutors in the Southern District of New York that Cohen's 'instinct to blame others is strong.' ...\n\n\"Cohen also said he spoke to Sekulow about a potential pardon 'quite a few' times 'before and after' his testimony to the committee. He said Sekulow didn't say directly that the president was considering giving him a pardon, but rather said 'there's always the possibility of a pre-pardon.'\"\n\n-- New York prosecutors are scrutinizing thousands of documents relating to Trump's inauguration. CNN's Kara Scannell reports: \"The President's Inaugural Committee handed over the cache of documents over the course of several weeks in response to a wide-ranging subpoena seeking documents, records, and communications concerning the inaugural's finances, vendors, and donors sent in February by the US attorney's office with the Southern District of New York. The last set of documents was produced within the last month. The end of the document production indicates the investigation is moving into the next stage.\"\n\n-- Sweden formally issued an extradition request for Julian Assange. The WikiLeaks founder is serving time in Britain for skipping bail, but he's wanted in Stockholm to face sexual assault charges. This could set off a tug of war between Sweden and the United States, which wants Assange extradited on allegations of conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer. (AP)\n\n-- Russians seeking to interfere in U.S. elections strategized about how to sow racial discord here as recently as last year, according to newly obtained documents. NBC News's Richard Engel, Kate Benyon-Tinker and Kennett Werner report: \"Communications between associates of Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Kremlin-linked oligarch indicted by [Mueller] for previous influence operations against the U.S. ... laid out a new plot to manipulate and radicalize African-Americans. The plans show that Prigozhin's circle has sought to exploit racial tensions well beyond Russia's social media and misinformation efforts tied to the 2016 election. ... One document said that [Trump's] election had 'deepened conflicts in American society' and suggested that, if successful, the influence project would 'undermine the country's territorial integrity and military and economic potential.'\"\n\nTHE RULE OF LAW:\n\n-- At a rally in Pennsylvania last night, Trump criticized Hillary Clinton. When the crowd began chanting \"Lock her up,\" the president replied: \"We have a great new attorney general who's going to give it a very fair look.\"\n\n-- That attorney general, Bill Barr, insisted in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he's fighting more to protect the institution of the presidency than Trump personally. The Journal's Sadie Gurman reports: \"'I felt the rules were being changed to hurt Trump, and I thought it was damaging for the presidency over the long haul,' Mr. Barr said. ... 'At every grave juncture the presidency has done what it is supposed to do, which is to provide leadership and direction,' he said in an interview. 'If you destroy the presidency and make it an errand boy for Congress, we're going to be a much weaker and more divided nation.' ... Many current and former law-enforcement officials have come to view Mr. Barr skeptically, citing his newly launched review of the investigation's origins and what he termed 'spying' on Trump campaign associates over ties to Russians. He hasn't explained what specifically prompted his concerns.\"\n\n-- Trump also called for the government to investigate Joe Biden's son, Hunter, over his business deals in China during an interview that aired Sunday on Fox News. It's a fresh illustration of the president's personal disdain for the rule of law. The Times's Maggie Haberman, Annie Karni, Ken Vogel and Katie Benner report: \"It was the latest in a long series of statements by Mr. Trump suggesting he would like to see criminal investigations of opponents including Clinton, John Kerry and the Democratic National Committee, and it came as the president seems particularly preoccupied by Mr. Biden's candidacy. ... 'It's a terrible breach of norms for the president to publicly advocate prosecutions of his opponents,' said Jack Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School who was an assistant attorney general during President George W. Bush's first term.\"\n\n-- At his rally in Pennsylvania last night, Trump prosecuted an economic case against Joe Biden. Anne Gearan reports from Montoursville, Pa.: \"The president touted an economic turnaround on his watch, saying Pennsylvania now has historically low unemployment that no political competitor could best. 'Sleepy Joe said that he's running to, quote, \"save the world,\"' Trump said to laughter from supporters. 'Well, he was: He was going to save every country but ours!' Trump's 'Make America Great Again' rally at an airport hangar in this small north-central Pennsylvania town was nominally a show of support for Republican state Rep. Fred Keller, the heavy favorite in a special election Tuesday to fill the congressional seat vacated in January by Tom Marino, a Republican who had just been reelected to his fifth term. ...\n\n\"Trump called a pan-Asia trade deal backed by Biden 'a disaster' for Pennsylvania and singled out remarks Biden recently made about charting a new course with China. Biden has staked much of his early campaign message on the theory that he can deny Trump a repeat victory here. A native of working-class Scranton, more than an hour to the east, Biden inaugurated his 2020 campaign in Pennsylvania and is using Philadelphia as his campaign headquarters. 'Biden deserted you,' Trump said. 'I guess he was born here, but he left you, he left you for another state.'\"\n\n-- Trump remains incredibly popular among blue-collar white workers in northeast Ohio, even though his presidency has not reversed the region's economic decline. The Times's Trip Gabriel has great reporting from the ground: \"The loss of 1,600 jobs in March at a General Motors plant in Lordstown, despite Mr. Trump's visible efforts to save them, was the latest blow. But even though stresses on families and communities are already acute, Mr. Trump appears to have lost little of his blue-collar support here. It is a sign of how tight a bond he has with voters who were once staunch Democrats, in an allegiance as much cultural as economic. But it also undermines the argument of [Biden] that he would be the best nominee to win back Midwest states because of his own appeal to working-class voters.\"\n\n-- Trump is preparing for a jet-setting summer of international travel to show stature on the world stage. The AP's Zeke Miller and Jill Colvin report: \"Four days in Tokyo. Then it's off to see Queen Elizabeth before a jaunt to Normandy, France, and perhaps time in Ireland. A return trip to Japan? Why not. And throw in Seoul. Then it's back to France for Trump for a summit with world leaders. ... The flurry of international travel is a marked change of pace for a president who likes to sleep in his own bed and rarely strays far from the White House unless it's to his own properties. The packed calendar is the product of both a concerted attempt by Trump to wrap himself in the trappings of the presidency heading into re-election season and a fluke of the global summit calendar.\"\n\n-- Despite his role as commander in chief, Trump continues to tweet out his thoughts about the 2020 Democrats like the country's \"narrator in chief.\" Ashley Parker and Robert Costa have a smart piece on how the president is always in your head, no matter if you love him or hate him: \"Trump in recent weeks has weighed in on actor Jussie Smollett's case in Chicago ('It is an embarrassment to our Nation!'), instructed the French government on how to fight the fire that engulfed Paris's Notre Dame Cathedral ('flying water tankers'), and disparaged what he viewed as the 'political correctness' of the Kentucky Derby ('It was a rough & tumble race on a wet and sloppy track'). ... Trump's naked eagerness to make any story or occasion about himself stems from his self-conception as both a star and a producer, a director and a writer, according to friends, advisers and critics. And now, they say, he is able to deploy the platform of the presidency to amplify that vision of himself as a leading man.\"\n\nEARTH IN THE BALANCE:\n\n-- The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution, which would make it easier to roll back key climate change rules. The Times's Lisa Friedman reports: \"The new analytical model would significantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted. ... The five people familiar with the plan, all current or former E.P.A. officials, said the new modeling method would appear in the agency's analysis of the final version of the replacement regulation, known as the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which is expected to be made public in June.\"\n\n-- The EPA is also cutting off funding for several research centers that study the effects of pollution on childhood development. Greenwire's Corbin Hiar and Ariel Wittenberg report: \"The move, critics say, is part of a broader effort by [Trump] to downplay science that could lead to stricter regulations on polluting industries. At issue are 13 Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Centers located at institutions across the country.\"\n\n-- The U.S. government put nuclear waste under a dome in the Marshall Islands. It is now cracking open. The president of the islands, Hilda Heine, is concerned that there's a risk of radioactive materials leaking. (Kyle Swenson)\n\n-- Bayer, Monsanto's new parent company, is facing thousands of new Roundup cancer lawsuits after a $2 billion judgment. Bayer plans on appealing the verdict, which awarded $1 billion each to a couple diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after they used the Roundup herbicide for years. (NBC News)\n\nTHE CHINA THREAT:\n\n-- Chinese leaders are preparing their citizens for a drawn-out trade war with Trump by evoking past battles with the Americans, including their assistance to North Korea during the 1950s. Anna Fifield reports: Chinese President Xi Jinping, \"accompanied by his top trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, on Monday placed a floral basket at a monument in Jiangxi province commemorating the start of the Long March in 1934. In the 4,000-mile, year-long trek, the Communists broke through Nationalist lines, eventually ousting them and installing Mao Zedong as leader of China. Meanwhile, China's main movie channel, CCTV-6, has scrapped its regular programming in favor of films about the Korean War, which ended in a draw after China intervened to fight back the Americans.\"\n\n-- U.S. technology companies started curbing sales to the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. Jeanne Whalen, Greg Bensinger, Ellen Nakashima and Hamza Shaban report: \"Google said it would restrict Huawei's access to future updates of its Android operating software, which powers many of Huawei's phones. Other U.S. manufacturers also began suspending business dealings with the Chinese firm. The markets punished many of those suppliers Monday, including Intel, Broadcom and Qualcomm, as well as Micron and semiconductor manufacturer Cypress. ... On Monday evening, the Commerce Department slightly eased the timing of the restrictions, saying it would allow some transactions to continue for 90 days, to facilitate 'certain activities necessary to the continued operations of existing networks and to support existing mobile services.'\"\n\n-- Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei said the confrontation between the U.S. and China that he's been caught up in was \"inevitable.\" He also said U.S. trade restrictions will not deter Huawei's 5G expansion plans. (South China Morning Post)\n\n-- Morgan Stanley said the collapse of U.S.-Chinese trade talks could push the global economy toward a recession. \"If talks stall, no deal is agreed upon and the U.S. imposes 25% tariffs on the remaining circa $300 billion of imports from China, we see the global economy heading towards recession,\" the bank's analysts said in a note. They added that such circumstances would force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates back to zero within a year. (Reuters)\n\n-- A Ukrainian aircraft engine factory has become the Chinese military's new cash-hungry partner. Anton Troianovski reports: \"The president of a top Ukrainian aerospace company says its new Chinese investors often ask the staff for 'little conversations.' They want to know about record-keeping and planning, the setup of production lines and the interplay between workshops. 'They'll talk for three hours, and the next day, a totally different group of people will come,' said Vyacheslav Boguslayev, whose sprawling Soviet-era company, Motor Sich, is one of the most advanced military aircraft engine manufacturers in the world. ... Racing to upgrade its military, China has been turning to Ukraine. And Ukraine -- with its economy scrambled by hostilities with Russia -- has been willing to accept China's embrace.\"\n\n-- The Department of Homeland Security warned that Chinese-made drones may be sharing sensitive flight data with their manufacturers. An alert from DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warns that the drones \"contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.\" (CNN)\n\n-- Detainees in China's reeducation camps for Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang are given an hour or so to cry every two weeks, according to a woman who was held at one of the facilities. From Radio Free Asia: \"Since April 2017, authorities in the XUAR have held an estimated 1.5 million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities accused of harboring 'strong religious views' and 'politically incorrect' ideas in the camps ... Reporting ... has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination [and] routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers ... Guzire Awulqanqizi, a Kazakh woman who was held at the Dongmehle Re-education Camp [said] that detainees dealing with the stress of 14-hour days of political study are given a 'crying session' every two weeks.\"\n\nTHE IMMIGRATION WARS:\n\n-- Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state who blew a totally winnable governor's race last fall because of his polarizing approach, gave the White House a detailed list of 10 demands for him to become Trump's \"immigration czar.\" The Times's Maggie Haberman and Annie Karni scoop: \"Access to a government jet 24 hours a day. An office in the West Wing, plus guaranteed weekends off for family time. And an assurance of being made secretary of homeland security by November. Those were among a list of 10 conditions ... Kobach also said he would need to be the main television spokesman for the Trump administration on immigration policy. And he said he wanted a guarantee that cabinet secretaries whose portfolios relate to immigration would defer to him, with the president mediating disputes if need be. The list was submitted by Mr. Kobach in recent weeks as he discussed his interest in the job. Other conditions included having a staff of seven reporting to him, 'walk in' privileges to the Oval Office, a security detail if deemed necessary and the title of assistant to the president. ... The existence of the list has become known among officials in the Trump administration, some of whom were taken aback by what they regard as its presumptuousness. Mr. Trump has also been considering others for the role, and he is said to be leaning toward Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the former Virginia attorney general. Mr. Cucinelli has made his own requests related to the job, such as a security detail and transportation to work.\"\n\n-- A 16-year-old Guatemalan boy detained at the southern border died while in U.S. custody in Texas. Abigail Hauslohner reports: \"Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez was found unresponsive in his detention cell 'during a welfare check' Monday, a day after a nurse practitioner had diagnosed him with Influenza A and Border Patrol officials had moved to isolate him from other detained migrants, a CBP official told reporters during a conference call. ... He is the fifth migrant child since December to die after being taken into custody at the southern border by federal immigration authorities.\"\n\n-- New documents show that immigrants detained by ICE are sometimes placed in solitary confinement for reasons unrelated to rule violations. NBC News's Hannah Rappleye, Andrew W. Lehren, Spencer Woodman and Vanessa Swales report: \"The newly-obtained documents paint a disturbing portrait of a system where detainees are sometimes forced into extended periods of isolation for reasons that have nothing to do with violating any rules. ... Only half of the cases involved punishment for rule violations. The other half were unrelated to disciplinary concerns -- they involve the mentally ill, the disabled or others who were sent to solitary largely for what ICE described as safety reasons.\"\n\n-- Meanwhile, down under, Australia's reelection of its conservative government has triggered a spate of suicide attempts among the country's refugees. From France 24: \"Many had prayed for a more lenient policy from Labor, who had been strongly tipped to win. But an unexpected victory by Scott Morrison's centre-right coalition ... dashed hopes and set off a wave of self-harm including several hospitalisations.\"\n\nALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN AND WOMEN:\n\n-- George Papadopoulos, a member of Trump's 2016 campaign, is a perfect metaphor for 2019. T.A. Frank profiles him for this Sunday's Washington Post Magazine: \"I first met George Papadopoulos, the unlikely trigger of an investigation that many thought would take down Donald Trump, on a balmy California day in December 2018, less than a week after his release from federal prison. ... His 12 days in prison, he said, were worst before the fact. The reality of minimum-security confinement came as a relief. 'You're expecting you're going in to get raped and killed,' he said. 'I get inside the prison, and the guards are basically mocking my sentence: 'You're more trouble for us than we are for you.'\u2009' ... In person, he came across as warm, oddly guileless and eager to please. He made boastful claims. ('I was on a first-name basis with Netanyahu for four years.') He made ingratiating claims. ('As an individual I'm more comfortable with Washington Post people like you than with, I dunno, the Daily Caller.') And then there was his central claim: that the entire federal investigation of Trump had its origins in dirty tricks masterminded by a group of foreign and U.S. intelligence entities.\"\n\n-- \"Fox & Friends\" co-host Pete Hegseth privately lobbied Trump to pardon U.S. servicemen accused and convicted of war crimes. Hegseth, an Iraq War veteran, has pressed the president to pardon the men since as early as January. (The Daily Beast)\n\n-- Former Trump associate Roger Stone wants a judge's permission to appear at a strip club in Tennessee where he is scheduled to judge a national exotic dancer competition. Mother Jones's Dan Friedman reports: \"On Thursday, lawyers for Roger Stone, whose travel is restricted ahead of his November trial on obstruction of justice and perjury charges, requested a judge's permission to visit Tennessee and Illinois 'for business opportunities.' ... In a Facebook post, the club said Stone will judge dancers alongside Kristin Davis, who is known as the 'Manhattan Madam' for her role running a high-end prostitution ring in New York City in the early 2000s. Stone has previously employed Davis, and they are close friends. ... Last week, he launched a 'Family Support Fund' to seek donations to cover 'rent, food, medical expenses, insurance, gasoline, and the most basic of living expenses' for him and his wife. Strip-club appearance fees may be an emerging source of income for the cash-strapped dirty trickster.\"\n\n-- Education Secretary Betsy DeVos used her personal email to conduct government business. Laura Meckler reports: \"The report found fewer than 100 emails sent or received to personal accounts between Jan. 20, 2017 ... and April 10, 2018. It said most messages were in the first six months of 2017, from a single writer offering advice on potential candidates for agency positions. The writer, who was not identified, also included other department employees on his or her messages, using their official government email addresses. ... The report also flagged the department's failure to produce emails from DeVos's private accounts in response to one request under the Freedom of Information Act. ... A department spokeswoman, Liz Hill, did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but she said on Twitter that any coverage of the matter was overblown.\"\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Iran has quadrupled its uranium-enrichment production capacity. The AP's Nasser Karimi and Jon Gambrell report: \"Iranian officials made a point to stress that the uranium would be enriched only to the 3.67% limit set under the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, making it usable for a power plant but far below what's needed for an atomic weapon. But by increasing production, Iran soon will exceed the stockpile limitations set by the accord. Tehran has set a July 7 deadline for Europe to set new terms for the deal, or it will enrich closer to weapons-grade levels in a Middle East already on edge.\"\n\n-- Trump said there's \"no indication\" of threatening actions by Tehran, playing down tensions with Iran. Felicia Sonmez reports: \"'We have no indication that anything's happened or will happen, but if it does, it will be met, obviously, with great force. We will have no choice,' [he said]. Trump's description of Iran's recent actions stood somewhat in contrast with the portrayal given by his national security team. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in a tweet earlier Monday that Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, had warned about 'escalating tensions' with Iran.\"\n\n-- Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif dismissed Trump's \"genocidal taunts.\" From the BBC: \"Mr Zarif said the US president should look to history. 'Iranians have stood tall for millennia while aggressors all gone... Try respect - it works!' ... Writing on Twitter on Monday, Iran's foreign minister said the US president was being 'goaded' by what he called the 'B Team' -- a reference to [Bolton], Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.\"\n\n-- Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that, while he favors talks and diplomacy, the current conditions do not allow for them. \"Today's situation is not suitable for talks and our choice is resistance only,\" the Iranian state news agency IRNA quoted Rouhani as saying. (Reuters)\n\n-- Another senior Iranian official called Trump a \"crazy president\" while slamming his mixed messages over any potential conflict. CNN's Nicole Gaouette reports: \"Iran's director of foreign affairs for the country's parliament, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian ... pointed to the US leader's ongoing campaign to strangle Iran's economy on the one hand and his requests for Iran to talk on the other. 'In his mind, Trump thinks he has a gun to Iran's head with sanctions and he is trying to shut down our economy,' Amir-Abdollahian told CNN's Fred Pleitgen. 'This is all in his imagination. Now he wants us to call him? This is a crazy president!'\"\n\n-- Swamp watch: The Libyan National Army, a militia group led by Khalifa Haftar, has hired its own Washington lobbyist. From Politico's Theodoric Meyer: \"Stephen Payne and Brian Ettinger of Linden Government Solutions will lobby in Washington on behalf of Haftar's forces as well as assist with 'international coalition building' and public relations. ... The one-year contract, which will be filed with the Justice Department, is worth $2 million.

And the candidates are in the same position as the rest of the country, not to mention the Murdoch family who controls the network, and even the president of the United States: What to do about Fox News? ... Trump does his best to support the Fox News hosts who support him. ... Meanwhile, Democratic candidates have taken very different approaches to the network. In March, the Democratic National Committee barred Fox News from hosting a Democratic primary. But many candidates, such as [Pete] Buttigieg, are breaking from the party line and going on Fox, each in his or her own way.\"\n\n-- A host of \"Fox & Friends\" slammed Buttigieg for criticizing Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham. The Times's Michael M. Grynbaum reports: \"Mr. Buttigieg's hourlong appearance spawned headlines, solid ratings, and kudos from liberals pleased to see the South Bend, Ind., mayor calling out Fox News pundits on their own network. The reaction was chillier among some of the network's core conservative viewers ... On Monday's 'Fox & Friends,' the host Brian Kilmeade scolded Mr. Buttigieg for criticizing his fellow commentators. ... 'Don't hop on our channel and continue to put down the other hosts on the channel,' Mr. Kilmeade said. 'If you feel that negative about it, don't come. For him to go out there and take shots on our prime-time lineup, without going on our prime-time lineup, shows to me absolutely no courage.'\"\n\n-- Black voters say they are struggling with cynicism toward the field of candidates after they've been let down so many times. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: \"Interviews with dozens of black voters in three competitive states -- Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina -- found deep divisions beneath that party loyalty about the best way to wield the power they bring to the ballot box, and a sense that past political engagement has been met with broken promises and little progress for struggling communities. In addition to regional and generational divides, voters' perceptions are further muddied by the fact that there are nearly two dozen major candidates, including six women and two black senators -- minority candidates who have to contend with the disappointment of some black voters who feel the first black president didn't do enough for them.\"\n\n-- Walmart employees brought a surprise guest to their company's annual meeting as they continue fighting for higher wages and better benefits: Bernie Sanders. Abha Bhattarai reports: \"The presidential candidate, who has repeatedly called on Walmart to improve its working conditions, is heading to Bentonville, Ark., on June 5 to introduce a shareholders' proposal that would give hourly Walmart workers a seat on the company's board. 'These workers need and deserve a seat at the table,' Sanders (I-Vt.) told The Washington Post.

It's easy to assume that the solution is to wall ourselves off, to draw apart. If, ultimately, other people pose the greatest threat to my person and my property, perhaps I should distance myself from them. Jewish legal sources -- including the Mishnah, and the later rabbinic elaborations in the Talmud -- have a lot to say about restitution for damages. Nowhere, however, does Jewish law recommend living in isolation. Community is essential to being a Jew, because community is essential to being a human. We need one another. When we live in close proximity, we will inevitably cause damage to our neighbors, whether with our words or our actions, and we lay ourselves open to being damaged in turn.

Farmers who had been hiding from law enforcement for years were asked to present themselves to authorities and to comply with new commercial-growing ordinances. ... Before legalization, people grew cannabis however they could and developed methods to avoid getting caught by law enforcement. Regulation demands a different set of skills. Instead of burning records, farmers must now practice accounting. ... Legalization brings with it the costs of taxes, permitting, compliance, and new competitors. It has also occasioned a rapid drop in price. Now Humboldt County is experiencing not only an economic crisis but also an existential one. What happens to a group of people whose anti-government ethos was sustained by an illegal plant that is now the most regulated crop in California?\"\n\n-- The Economist, \"Europe's hard-right is pitching voters a contradictory fantasy\": \"Europe's right-wing populists will take votes off an array of mainstream rivals at next weekend's election to the European Parliament. But what exactly do they want? To that, the nationalists provided answers of sorts at their big end-of-campaign rally in Milan's Piazza del Duomo today. Under sporadic rain showers in the shadow of the city's cathedral, right-populist leaders from eleven EU countries demanded a 'revolution' to overthrow the existing order in Brussels and build a 'Europe of nations'. They were confident. They were loud. They reaped the applause of thousands of supporters of Italy's hard-right Lega, the host party, gathered in the square waving giant flags in the drizzle.

Laura Vozzella reports: \"While a spate of states have recently made access to abortion more difficult, advocates in Virginia are trying to make it easier. The case is being heard in an election year when Republicans are trying to hold onto their razor-thin control of the legislature and when abortion politics -- dormant for the past few cycles -- probably will be prominent. ... The case in federal court in Richmond comes after Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio banned abortions after doctors can detect a fetal heartbeat ... The lawsuit was brought by a coalition of abortion rights groups, including the Center for Reproductive Rights, the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood and several abortion clinics across the state. The state Department of Health and the office of Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D) are defending the rules. The case has put Herring in an awkward position as both an advocate for abortion rights and the state official tasked with defending Virginia law.

May 21 at 9:32 AM\n\nBEIJING -- A battle between Chinese tech giant Huawei and the United States was \"inevitable,\" its founder said Tuesday, shrugging off any suggestion that Washington would be able to stifle his company's global ambitions.\n\nHuawei is at the heart of the trade war between the United States and China, an example -- according to the Trump administration -- of the way that state-supported Chinese companies have gained an unfair advantage over American ones and are now being used to further China's geopolitical goals.\n\nRen Zhengfei, a 74-year-old former People's Liberation Army engineer who built this Chinese industrial titan, is shrugging off the Trump administration's efforts to block Huawei Technology being used in the United States and around the world.\n\n\"I've sacrificed myself and family for the sake of our goal to stand on top of the world,\" Ren told a group of Chinese journalists Tuesday, according to a transcript published by state-run China Central. \"To achieve this goal, a conflict with the U.S. is inevitable.\"\n\nRen's daughter is Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei who has been under house arrest in Canada since the start of December and is fighting an American extradition request. She is wanted in New York to face charges related to allegedly breaching American sanctions against trading with Iran.\n\nThe Trump administration last week also added Huawei to a trade blacklist because the company \"is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interest,\" banning American firms from selling to Huawei without special approval from the government.\n\n[Huawei supply ban roils stocks as U.S. companies begin to cut off China tech giant ]\n\nThe Commerce Department slightly eased the timing of the restrictions on Monday night, just before Ren held his news conference, saying it would allow some transactions to continue for 90 days to facilitate \"certain activities necessary to the continued operations of existing networks and to support existing mobile services.\"\n\nThe temporary reprieve will allow Huawei to receive U.S. equipment to service existing Huawei mobile phone users and rural broadband networks.\n\nHuawei is the world's largest technology equipment maker and the largest provider of equipment used in 5G telecom networks. It has overtaken Apple to become the world's second largest seller of cellphones after Samsung.\n\nThe tech giant has an annual procurement budget of $70 billion and last week said that more than $1 out of every $7 is spends goes on equipment from U.S. companies like Intel and Qualcomm. It also buys Android operating software for its smartphones from Google, which has now said it will restrict the company's access to future updates.\n\nRen said that the delay in imposing the ban didn't matter much to Huawei because it had been preparing for this moment for some time.\n\n\"Last year, I guessed the U.S. would attack within two years and we'd have plenty of time to prepare, but the Meng Wanzhou case made us realize it was happening earlier than I expected,\" he said, referring to his daughter's arrest and detention.\n\nRen suggested that Huawei had been stockpiling chips. The company will not encounter extreme supply shortage \"as we are well prepared,\" he said.\n\nAnalysts also believe that Huawei has long been getting ready for a situation like this, remembering a time in 2013 when Chinese institutions had moved to block some American tech companies. Furthermore, the Trump administration blocked Huawei's much smaller competitor, ZTE from doing business with U.S. firms, a move that spelled certain death for the company. Trump, however, later eased ZTE's punishment.\n\n\"Huawei has been accumulating experience and technology for decades and it can hang on. It has the confidence for the short run,\" said Fu Liang, a telecoms analyst based in Beijing. \"For the long run, it's hard predict what might happen as Huawei is affected by the broader environment.\"\n\nAsked how long these challenges might go on, Huawei's Ren said: \"You need to ask Trump, not me, about this.\"\n\n[How China's Huawei took the lead over U.S. companies in 5G technology ]\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry continued its sharp criticism of the U.S. moves against Huawei.\n\n\"As we have said many times, the U.S. is using its national means to oppress and smear a certain Chinese company, and this will serve no one's interests in the end,\" spokesman Lu Kang told reporters Tuesday. \"In international relations, and when doing trade, we must follow the principle of equality and mutual benefit. We will defend our companies' legitimate rights and interests,\" he said.\n\nThe Chinese government sees the Trump administration's actions on Huawei and the broader trade war as part of an American effort to contain China's rise and stop it from challenging the United States as the world's number one superpower.\n\nState media have been full of exhortations to prepare for a long fight with the United States, portraying the trade war as an epic battle, even changing television schedules to run old war movies.\n\nThe People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, said Tuesday that trying to stop China's development and rise is like \"a praying mantis trying to stop a car with its arms.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the official Xinhua News Agency published some Chinese proverbs on its social media account on Tuesday, suggesting the U.S. officials would be well advised to learn them. They included \"fool oneself as well as others\" and \"those who do not have justice on their side will get little help.\"\n\nWang Yuan and Liu Yang contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump administration cracks down on giant Chinese tech firm, escalating clash with Beijing\n\nU.S. officials planning for a future in which Huawei has a major share of 5G global networks\n\nWhat 'arrest' means for the Canadians detained in China -- and the epic battle over Huawei", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Q1D2e80keTMJoutZs9Qfef0gW1g=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TZTXPYD3ZQI6TJNTGTZ634JVDY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4801602", "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 296142300}, {"uri": "1141464278", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "13:36:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T13:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/us/california-drinking-water.html", "title": "Why California's Water Crisis Is So Difficult to Solve", "body": "Good morning.\n\n(Here's the sign-up, if you don't already get California Today delivered to your inbox.)\n\nWhen I was working for The Bakersfield Californian, I wrote about the woes of a tiny water company whose last well ran dry. Residents of the cluster of mobile homes the company served told me about bathing with baby wipes and being unable to flush the toilet without using up precious reserves.\n\nI remember being surprised that even in California, people lived without reliable access to water.\n\nThat was in 2012. The issues that plagued that community had been building for decades before then, and, as my colleague Jose Del Real reports in a new story, they've since become even more urgent. Jose explained why:\n\nNearly one million Californians are exposed to unsafe drinking water each year.\n\nAnd while California's drinking water problems span the length of the state, about half of California's failing water systems are concentrated in the agricultural San Joaquin Valley.\n\nThe Valley's farms feed the country, but it's an unsettling reality that the low-income farmworkers who cultivate the crops live in conditions that have been likened to the developing world.\n\nA complicated web of factors contribute to the problem in the Central Valley: the heavy use of fertilizer in the area; the high concentration of dairy farms; the ruralness of the region itself, which makes broad infrastructure development difficult to finance; and the isolation of many communities that started as farm labor camps.\n\nWhile water experts and activists have long known about the problems, it has been difficult to garner attention outside of affected communities.\n\n\"Most of the general public doesn't really worry about water unless there's something going on with their own water supply,\" said Ellen Hanak, the director of the Water Policy Center at the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nOur reporting took us to East Orosi, a small unincorporated town of about 500 in Tulare County surrounded by orange fields, where the water that spews from the taps is tainted by fertilizer chemicals.\n\nThere, Martha Sanchez and her family, who make their living picking oranges and cherries, have received notices not to use the water from the taps. Through a state grant, they received bottled water each month, but the heavy jugs are unwieldy and they always run out.\n\n\"We complain, but it's like nobody really cares,\" said Ms. Sanchez. \"We're just a little town over here where there's nothing.\"\n\nThis year there is a renewed sense of urgency among lawmakers in Sacramento to address the problem, but it's proving difficult. And East Orosi is emblematic of many towns throughout the Central and Salinas Valleys. The town's struggles with contaminated water are years old. Its neighboring town, Orosi, just one mile away, has clean drinking water, but consolidating water systems has proved difficult because of politics and money. Even if everything goes their way, residents of East Orosi may not have clean water flowing from their taps for years.\n\n[Read more about East Orosi and the politics of clean water infrastructure here.]\n\nHere's what else we're following\n\n(We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

(Michael Ainsworth/AP)\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates are criticizing the Federal Communications Commission chairman's decision to greenlight the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint -- the latest sign that antitrust issues are core to many of their 2020 platforms.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) say a merger of the telecommunications giants would leave consumers with fewer choices. \"The merger between T-Mobile and Sprint will lead to higher prices and fewer choices for consumers and some 30,000 lost jobs,\" said Sarah Ford, a spokeswoman for Sanders.\n\nKlobuchar, who is expected to publish a book on antitrust issues later this year, said the deal could harm competition. \"T-Mobile has long been a competitive disruptor in the market, bringing down prices and spurring innovation,\" Klobuchar said in a statement. \"I don't think going from four to three major carriers will be good for competition in the long term.\"\n\nSo far, the question of breaking up Facebook has been the primary focus of the antitrust debate among those seeking the Democratic nomination. But the recent pushback against the Sprint and T-Mobile merger underscores how their fight against corporate consolidation extends far beyond Silicon Valley.\n\nExpect more of this: It could be a key way to rally their base and distinguish their economic message from President Trump's -- especially if his administration allows the telecommunications giants to merge.\n\n\"When Bernie is in the White House, he will aggressively stand up to monopolies in all industries, including telecommunications, by breaking up existing monopolies and placing moratoriums on mergers in highly concentrated industries,\" Ford told me in a statement. \"We live in an era of unchecked corporate power. It's time to take that power back for the people.\"\n\nAlthough Sanders and Klobuchar were the only ones to weigh in on Monday after FCC chairman Ajit Pai publicly voiced support for the $26 billion merger yesterday, other 2020 contenders are on record criticizing the deal. Earlier this year, Klobuchar, Sanders, Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) were among the Democratic senators who sent a letter to Pai, calling on the agency to reject the deal. They also sent a similar letter to the Justice Department.\n\nThe merger is \"likely to raise prices for consumers, harm workers, stifle competition, exacerbate the digital divide, and undermine innovation,\" the senators wrote in their previous letter. Representatives for Gillibrand, Warren and Booker did not imemdiately respond to requests for comment.\n\nPai's decision was based on commitments the companies made to expand rural broadband service; build a 5G network; and sell off Boost Mobile, a product that sells prepaid phone services. Brendan Carr, another Republican commissioner, announced yesterday he also supported the deal.\n\nYet for the Sprint T-Mobile merger to emerge as the emblem of the Democrats' resistance to Trump's positions on corporate consolidation, it has to actually take place. While Pai gave the OK, the Justice Department could still move to block the deal. And yesterday, Bloomberg News reported that the agency is leaning against approving the merger because of competition concerns.\n\nBITS: The United States has temporarily softened its trade restrictions on Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, Karen Freifeld, David Shepardson and Brenda Goh report for Reuters. The company's founder said the U.S. move meant little because Huawei was already prepared for U.S. action.\n\nThe Commerce Department yesterday granted Huawei a license to buy U.S. goods until August 19 in order to maintain existing phone networks and provide software updates to Huawei firms. The move signals the department is temporarily easing a decision it made last week to blacklist the company from business with U.S. suppliers.\n\nHuawei is still barred from buying American-made hardware and software to make new products without other licenses, which can be harder to get.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement on Monday that the temporary license was intended to give telecom operators dependent on Huawei equiptment time to find altenratives.\n\n\"In short, this license will allow operations to continue for existing Huawei mobile phone users and rural broadband networks,\" Ross said.\n\nAfter the announcement, Google reversed its earlier decision to cut ties with Huawei, CNBC's Sam Meredith reports. With the new exemption, Google can send software updates to Huawei phones for the next 90 days.\n\nNIBBLES: The U.S. has significantly slowed down approvals for semiconductor companies to hire Chinese nationals -- creating delays that are limiting the companies' access to key talent, the Wall Street Journal's Asa Fitch writes.\n\nThe slowdown began last year, and it's impacted hundreds of jobs at companies such as Intel, Qualcomm and Globalfoundries. These companies have seen limits in their abilities to hire Chinese employees, and they've also impeded their ability to move existing employees to the United States. Chinese nationals account for a large share of non-U.S. citizens hired for these technical roles.\n\nFor decades, people from China, Russia, Iran and other countries have had to get approval to work on essential technologies. The Commerce Department effectively considers these assignments an export because these workers could take their knowledge about a product home. These approvals used to take weeks, but now it's not unusual for it to take six to eight months, Asa reports.\n\n\"There have been longer delays that have led us to lose candidates we thought were critical,\" one industry insider told Asa.\n\nBYTES: President Trump's re-election campaign has far outspent any Democratic presidential candidate on Facebook advertising -- a repeat of a strategy that helped propel his White House victory three years ago, Thomas Kaplan and Sarah Almukhtar report for the New York Times.\n\nTrump has spent $4.9 million on Facebook ads, while all 23 Democratic presidential candidates combined have spent $9.6 million. Warren currently leads the 2020 Dems in total Facebook ad spending, followed by Harris and former vice president Joe Biden. None of the Democrats have spent more than $1.5 million.\n\nA bulk of Trump's spending came earlier in the year, when the 2020 Democratic field was much more narrow. There are signs that Democrats' Facebook spending could pick up. Biden has outspent Trump in the last several weeks on Facebook advertising, funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars into the ads.\n\n\"For a long time, Trump was running an intensive campaign that no one was paying attention to,\" said Mike Schneider, a partner at Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic political and brand communications firm that is tracking Facebook spending by the presidential candidates, told the Times. \"And while Democrats have picked up their efforts, they're fighting over the same group of supporters while he's broadly expanding his base,\" Mr. Schneider said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/b4a5680f07db5356e50cc9a3b2e31f80-3110-2298-70-8-VLVZWFD3DQI6TJNTGTZ634JVDY.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4800123", "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 296139540}, {"uri": "1141390157", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "12:06:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T12:06:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5254902243614197, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-finance-202/2019/05/21/the-finance-202-democrats-probing-trump-deutsche-bank-see-new-momentum/5ce2dd25a7a0a435cff8c0ea/", "title": "Analysis | The Finance 202: Democrats probing Trump, Deutsche Bank see new momentum", "body": "Congressional Democrats -- with new momentum in their legal fight to investigate President Trump's conduct and records -- are pressing Deutsche Bank for more information on a report that the firm ignored red flags about suspicious activity from the Trump and Kushner organizations. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner is now a senior White House adviser.\n\nThe development brings even more political heat to the only major financial firm willing to bank Trump over the past two decades as he suffered a series of bankruptcies and defaults -- and which still holds $300 million in outstanding debt from the now-president. Deutsche Bank also faced enormous fines -- $700 million in 2017 alone -- for money laundering and misconduct on behalf of clients. Its shares hit a record low on Monday.\n\nDemocrats on the Senate Banking Committee plan to press the issue with federal financial regulators at a hearing today. Ohio's Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the panel, and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) set the stage in a Monday letter to Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing asking for details about events described in a New York Times report from Sunday.\n\nThat story alleges that over 2016 and 2017, Deutsche's in-house anti-money-laundering experts recommended passing suspicious transactions involving Trump and Kushner-controlled entities along to the Treasury Department for further investigation. But executives in the bank's private wealth management division buried the reports instead.\n\nBrown plans to lead off his questioning today of the Treasury Department's top financial crimes enforcer and the FBI's section chief for financial crimes by highlighting the report.\n\n\"We need to get to the bottom of what happened here,\" Brown will say, according to a copy of his opening statement shared with The Finance 202. \"Everyone has to follow anti-money laundering laws and rules -- you don't get an exemption if you have a rich and powerful client. And we have to hold financial institutions accountable if they break the rules.\"\n\nAnd House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who along with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) last month subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for records relating to its extensive dealings with Trump, did not have a comment by press time.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have some wind at their backs as they press their case. A federal judge on Monday blocked Trump's bid to kill another House subpoena -- this one to his accounting firm, Mazars USA, for years of his financial records. In a forceful ruling, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta wrote it is \"not for the court to question whether the [House Oversight and Reform] Committee's actions are truly motivated by political considerations,\" and declined a request from Trump's lawyers to stay his order for more than seven days.\n\nTrump criticized the ruling:\n\nA federal judge in Manhattan could follow suit Wednesday when he holds a hearing on a similar attempt by the Trump team to block House subpoenas of Deutsche Bank and Capital One. Trump's lawyers have made the same argument there that fell short in the Mazars case: That Democratic lawmakers behind the document demands are motivated by improper political considerations.\n\n(Still, House Democratic leaders are divided over how, broadly, to approach attempting to hold Trump to account. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) faced down a number of her lieutenants eager to begin impeachment proceedings in a heated Monday night meeting, after the White House blocked former counsel Don McGahn from testifying to the House.)\n\nThe New York Times report prompted an angry response from Trump on Monday -- but not over the story's central claim that Deutsche Bank overlooked potentially shady transactions involving Trump entities. He bristled rather at the story's statement that the German bank has been the only major financial firm willing to extend him credit:\n\nThe New York Times reporter who wrote the Deutsche Bank piece challenged Trump's claim:\n\nTrump's tweet thread belongs to a tradition of defensive comments about his net worth, as The Post's Catherine Rampell points out. \"One theory is that, maybe, if Trump's tax returns or other financial records become public, his supporters would learn that he's not nearly as rich as he says,\" she writes. \"Another is that his finances are not exactly on the up and up. Of course, both explanations could be true.\"\n\nFor its part, Deutsche Bank released a statement Monday denying the Times report. \"At no time was an investigator prevented from escalating activity identified as potentially suspicious. Furthermore, suggestion that anyone was reassigned or fired in an effort to quash concerns relating to any client is categorically false,\" the bank said.\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that the whistleblower at the heart of the Times story never made the first claim the denial addresses. Rather, she says, she presented her best case for submitting a report to Treasury on the suspicious activity she uncovered, but senior executives with the bank's private banking division decided against her recommendation.\n\nNow, Congressional Democrats intend to pick up where those executives left off.\n\n-- Powell raises concern about business debt. The WSJ's Nick Timiraos and Andrew Ackerman: \"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said financial regulators must take seriously potential dangers that rising levels of business debt pose to the U.S. economy but said some comparisons to last decade's subprime-mortgage bubble overstate the risks... Views about the risks from rising corporate borrowing 'range from \"This is a return to the subprime-mortgage crisis\" to \"Nothing to worry about here,\"' said Mr. Powell. 'At the moment, the truth is likely somewhere in the middle.'\"\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\n-- China talks stall: Both the U.S. and China appear to be digging in for a prolonged trade war. To review: Since Trump and his administration accused China of backing away from a deal, the United States has doubled tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports; China has promised to retaliate with tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. goods by June 1; the United States is considering imposing tariffs on all remaining approximately $300 billion in Chinese imports not currently taxed; and at the end of last week, it sought to blacklist Huawei, one of China's leading technology companies. Meanwhile, the promise of talks have fizzled.\n\nDavid Dollar, senior fellow in the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution, broke down for Brent why he thinks the two sides are still so far away from a deal.\n\n... But while prospects with China sour, USMCA talks are looking slightly more promising. Trump announced on Friday that the United States would lift its steel and aluminum tariffs, which Sen.

WSJ's Dave Michaels: \"Wall Street watchdogs often tout the fines they levy on alleged wrongdoers. Yet much of that money is never collected.

(Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Democratic National Committee's computer networks still contain hackable vulnerabilities more than two years after a devastating breach that upended the 2016 election and dealt a major blow to the Hillary Clinton campaign, according to a new report out this morning.\n\nAnd the Republican National Committee, which was hacked during the 2018 election cycle, is doing only moderately better, according to the report from the company SecurityScorecard.\n\nHeading into the 2020 cycle, the results provide a stark warning about the cyber insecurity of the highest profile U.S. political organizations even after years of concerted efforts to improve digital safeguards and an intense focus in Washington on the need to secure campaigns and elections.\n\nAnd while SecurityScorecard found significant improvements since the last presidential campaign cycle, when the DNC was penetrated by Russian hackers -- who compromised vast troves of information and coordinated its release to damage Hillary Clinton's campaign -- these fixes may not be sufficient to keep either organization secure this time around.\n\n\"They're doing better, but a focused adversary is still going to be able to get in there and they're still going to be able to get interesting information,\" SecurityScorecard Chief Technology Officer Jasson Casey told me.\n\nSecurity Scorecard rates organizations' digital protections based on information that's available on the public Internet, such as how often they patch their software and whether public-facing internet tools are encrypted. The company makes most of its money by helping large organizations vet the cybersecurity of their partners and suppliers without conducting an intensive internal security audit.\n\nA DNC official who reviewed the latest results told me that this kind of external assessment doesn't capture all the work the organization has done to improve cybersecurity since 2016, but didn't dispute that there are still improvements to be made. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to express himself freely also criticized the report for lacking specific details about some of the vulnerabilities it claimed to find.\n\n\"I think we need to improve our security posture and we'll take feedback in whatever form it comes,\" the official said. \"Our adversaries are hard at work, nonstop. We'd just like to have more detail.\"\n\nThe results could raise questions about the vulnerability of a crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates who typically have much less time and far fewer resources to devote to security than the DNC -- but are equally juicy targets for Russian hackers, Casey noted. SecurityScorecard plans to start assessing the cybersecurity of those campaigns in the next couple of months, he told me.\n\nThe DNC and RNC now are about as well defended as the average company that is serious about cybersecurity, Casey said. But the report identified weaknesses, including gaps in encryption at both organizations that hackers might be able to use to steal employees' log-in credentials.\n\nAnd what's good enough for a company may not be good enough for a major political party that holds vast troves of data that a U.S. adversary could use to game the 2020 election. Russian hackers in 2016 were able to crack into the DNC, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Clinton campaign with just a few spearphishing emails. If political targets are better protected this cycle, that could mean hackers achieve their goals by just working harder.\n\n\"That's the lesson of the last two to three years,\" Casey said. \"They're not doing a poor job right now but there are still a lot of improvements to be made.\"\n\nBut we also shouldn't presume another breach is inevitable, said Amit Yoran, a former Homeland Security Department cybersecurity official who's now CEO of the cybersecurity company Tenable. Most high-profile breaches result from bad security rather than great hackers, he said, and improvements like the ones the DNC has made so far can actually go a long way toward locking them out. \"I think good cyber hygiene makes a tremendous difference, so things aren't hopeless,\" he said.\n\n\"Nothing here is smoking-gun bad,\" Yoran said of the report. \"There's no negligently bad behavior or 'Oh, my God' moments. [But] there are always things that need to be improved.\"\n\nPINGED: U.S. technology stocks dipped sharply Monday as companies started complying with a Commerce Department ban on supplying components to Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant that U.S. officials say could be a spying tool for Beijing.\n\n\"With $105 billion in global sales last year, Huawei has a vast web of customers and suppliers on nearly every continent\" and \"the markets punished many of those suppliers Monday, including Intel, Broadcom and Qualcomm, as well as Micron and semiconductor manufacturer Cypress,\" my colleagues Jeanne Whalen, Greg Bensinger, Ellen Nakashima and Hamza Shaban reported.\n\nAlso on Monday, \"the Commerce Department slightly eased the timing of the restrictions, saying it would allow some transactions to continue for 90 days, to facilitate 'certain activities necessary to the continued operations of existing networks and to support existing mobile services,'\" my colleagues reported.\n\nConfused by all the Huawei news? Here's a helpful explainer from the Associated Press's Frank Bajak and Michael Liedtke and a handy timeline from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nPATCHED: A bipartisan group of lawmakers is asking Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats to help ensure U.S. spying and hacking capabilities aren't being exported to countries with spotty human rights records, Ellen reported Monday.\n\nThe request comes after a Reuters report about former hackers for U.S. intelligence agencies who took contract jobs hacking for the United Arab Emirates -- and helped the gulf nation spy on a BBC host and the chairman of Al Jazeera among others.\n\n\"In a letter Monday coordinated by Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), the lawmakers expressed 'deep concern'\" about the allegations, Ellen reported. The letter was also signed by Intelligence Committee chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) among others.\n\nDutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.) last week added a requirement for the State Department to report on how it vets requests to provide those hacking services to a State Department spending bill.\n\nPWNED: DHS is warning companies that commercial drones manufactured in China may be stealing their data.\n\n\"The combination of the sensitive data collected by drones and the requirement of Chinese citizens to support 'national intelligence activities' makes the Chinese-made technology a significant risk to U.S. companies,\" Cyberscoop's Sean Lyngaas reported.\n\n\"The report does not name any specific manufacturers, but nearly 80% of the drones used in the US and Canada come from DJI, which is headquartered in Shenzhen, China,\" CNNs David Shortell reported.\n\n\"Be cautious when purchasing [drone] technology from Chinese manufacturers as they can contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself,\" according to the DHS advisory quoted by Cyberscoop.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/ac5010f67026989716cc743b36024bc0-2972-2000-70-8-DPJ5WSTQKMI6THVUBAUPKOEQCM.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 296136360}, {"uri": "1141331331", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-21", "time": "10:54:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-21T10:54:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/powerup/2019/05/21/powerup-democrats-face-their-own-divisions-on-abortion/5ce2dd021ad2e54b957e7fbc/", "title": "Analysis | Power Up: Democrats face their own divisions on abortion", "body": "Good morning and welcome back.

Thanks for waking up with us.\n\nTHE ABORTION WARS: So far, Republicans have been the ones on the defensive when it comes to strict new antiabortion laws being passed in red states like Alabama and Missouri. But Democrats are also wading through a messaging muddle of their own: how far to go to ensure that Roe v. Wade is protected, and whether to support antiabortion Democrats running for elected office.\n\nRight now, that issue is playing out most directly in the Democratic primary in Illinois's 3rd district where a progressive, abortion rights candidate, Marie Newman, is running to unseat the sitting, antiabortion Rep. Dan Lipinski.\n\nNewman, who failed to oust Lipinski by two points in the 2018 primary, called the DCCC and Bustos's support of Lipinski an \"absolute anathema\" that doesn't square with the Democratic National Committee's party platform.\n\nBustos has drawn significant controversy for implementing what critics call a \"blacklist\" for vendors working with primary challengers (they are barred from working with the House campaign committee.) The rule was \"very expensive for my campaign,\" Newman told us.\n\nEstablishment support of an antiabortion Democrat as the most aggressive abortion bans since the 1970s are taking hold throughout the country has renewed the debate over whether there's room in the Democratic Party for such candidates.\n\nNorth Carolina and Louisiana may be the next two states to advance antiabortion legislation -- in part due to Democratic support.\n\nProgramming note: Today, more than 50 organizations (Planned Parenthood, SisterSong, NARAL, and the Women's March) will hold over 300 demonstrations across the country as part of the National Day of Action to \"Stop the Bans.\"\n\nWHAT A DAY: Congress saw Trump in court and for now they have their first win.\n\nThe ruling marks the first victory in House Democrats' ongoing fight with the White House over the scope of congressional oversight and whether the broad range of current subpoenas and document requests pass legal muster. As expected, Trump said his lawyers would appeal the decision:\n\nThe legal decision was far from the only news on the oversight front:\n\nAnd not a small thing: Trump's former personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen is once again in the spotlight as House lawmakers released transcripts of his closed-door testimony. It should be noted that Cohen is in prison for lying to Congress.\n\nNope: \"Jane Serene Raskin and Patrick Strawbridge, attorneys for Sekulow, said in a statement that 'Cohen's alleged statements are more of the same from him and confirm the observations of prosecutors in the Southern District of New York that Cohen's 'instinct to blame others is strong,'\" our colleagues reported.\n\nCHINA TRADE TALKS STALL: The United States and China are not talking at the moment. Ever since Trump raised tariffs on China as payback for, in his eyes, backing out of a trade deal, Washington and Beijing have engaged in a tit-for-tat escalation of economic warfare that shows little signs of abating at the moment.\n\nHuawei or the highway: The latest skirmish centers on China's largest telecommunications company, Huawei, which was the target of two separate administration actions last week.\n\nThe expert take: Power Up spoke to David Dollar a senior fellow in the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution, just as the news of a three-month delay was breaking.\n\nBut overall trade negotiations seem to have a hit a wall:\n\nPart of the letter the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America sent to Trump that was signed by Nike, Adidas and other leading companies:\n\nMY MILKSHAKE BRINGS ALL THE BOYS TO THE...

But it no longer matters what Trump thinks -- and not just because the Alabama ban is already signed into law. Trump put Alabama on course to do what it has done.\n\nHe rewarded pro-life advocates for their support with two new justices, vetted by the conservative Federalist Society, and likely an antiabortion majority on the high court. Now, pro-lifers are predictably testing to see how far they can go in reversing Roe v Wade. Why wouldn't they? Trump's chance to influence this has passed.\n\nThis is just one of many cases in which Trump seems to be catching up with the consequences of his own actions. His policies toward China, Iran and on the southern border have likewise produced a variety of ill effects and unforeseen consequences. Unforeseen, but not unforeseeable: Trump seems to govern by smashing crockery, undoing decades of precedent and causing upheaval for its own sake -- without much regard for what the consequences might be.\n\nTrump's loyal supporters see the chaos he causes as its own reward. \"He continues to turn things upside down. Love it,\" one wrote to me last week in an email that well captured this sentiment.\n\nBut turning things upside down causes unpredictable and sometimes ugly results. Some were clear immediately, as in the botched rollout of the travel ban, the family separation policies and the attempt to repeal Obamacare without an alternative. The consequences of Trump's upending of other policies and norms -- alienating European allies, protecting access to firearms by the mentally ill, declaring a national emergency to circumvent Congress and launching a massive economic stimulus during an expansion -- might not be felt for years.\n\nAt some point, though, the consequences show themselves. Trump, for example, turned Iran policy upside down, pulling out of the \"horrible\" Iran nuclear agreement negotiated by the Obama administration and badgering European allies to accept tough new sanctions against Iran.\n\nNow, a year later: Iran has declared that it is resuming nuclear fuel production; a rocket fired by an Iran-aligned militia on Sunday landed near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad; the United States has pulled back diplomats from the area and sent an aircraft carrier amid rising tensions and an attack on oil tankers; and European allies are blaming the United States.\n\nLikewise, the administration blacklisted China's Huawei, the giant telecommunications-equipment maker. But then the administration realized the decision would cause many Americans, particularly in rural areas, to lose their phone service and Internet access. The Commerce Department is revisiting the just-implemented plan.\n\nIn the broader trade dispute with China, Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese goods to push China to negotiate. But trade talks broke down; China's retaliatory tariffs have caused a growing number of farm bankruptcies, while U.S. steel consumers and natural-gas producers have also been hurt.\n\nTrump upended Middle East policy, ending decades of attempts by the United States to be an honest broker between Israel and the Palestinians. He moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, cut aid to Palestinians and, last week, his ambassador, David Friedman, proclaimed that \"Israel is on the side of God.\" Now Jared Kushner's long-anticipated peace plan for the region is dead on arrival.\n\nTrump tossed out long-standing policy on North Korea, first threatening the country with \"fire and fury\" and then giving North Korea's dictator a world stage with a pair of summits, at which Trump said he and Kim \"fell in love.\" Trump declared the nuclear threat was over. But now Kim is back to testing missiles (though his nuclear program never stopped).\n\nOn the border, Trump vowed a hard-line policy to reduce illegal immigration, but it had the opposite effect. His threats of zero-tolerance induced migrants to hurry across the border, his alarms about America's vulnerability to \"caravans\" encouraged more, and his crackdown on lawful asylum seekers spurred illegal crossings. Apprehensions at the border exceeded 100,000 for a second straight month in April, the highest in 12 years.\n\nVirtually all of these unforeseen consequences could have been avoided if Trump had spent a few minutes foreseeing them. Instead, they took months to show themselves. And they could take years to repair.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\nLeana Wen: Trump owns this attack on American women\n\nE.J.

Google also said existing smartphone owners would not lose access to its Google Play app store or security features.\n\nBut unless the U.S. Commerce Department grants exceptions, a ban announced last week on all purchases of U.S. technology would badly hurt Huawei, analyst say.\n\nWashington claims Huawei poses a national security threat. Its placement on the so-called Entity List by the Trump administration last week is widely seen as intended to persuade resistant U.S. allies in Europe to exclude Huawei equipment from their next-generation wireless networks, known as 5G.\n\n\"This is major crisis for Huawei. Instead of being the world's largest handset manufacturer this year, it will struggle to stay two, but probably fall behind,\" analyst Roger Entner said. \"How competitive is a smartphone without the most well-known and popular apps?\"\n\nHuawei is expected to use its own, stripped-down version of Android, whose basic code is provided free of charge by Google. But it's not yet clear what other Google software and services -- such as maps, Gmail or search -- it will be able to use.\n\nEntner, founder of Recon Analytics, said Google itself won't have a large direct impact, \"as consumers will shift to other Android devices. The biggest concern is not to be caught in the crossfire of two governments.\"\n\nGartner analyst Tuong Nguyen said 48% of Huawei's phone shipments last year were outside of China and the company will need to scramble not to lose market share.\n\nSamsung led global smartphone sales in the first quarter of this year with a 23.1% share. Huawei was second with 19%, followed by Apple at 11.7%, according to IDC.\n\nHuawei's smartphone sales in the U.S. are tiny -- and the Chinese company's footprint in telecommunications networks is limited to smaller wireless and internet providers -- so any impact on U.S. consumers of a Google services cutoff would be slight.\n\nHardware suppliers led by Qualcomm, Broadcom and Intel would also be forced to halt shipments to Huawei under the Commerce Department rule, which requires all U.S. technology sales to the company to obtain U.S. government approval unless exceptions are made.\n\nThe global risk assessment outfit Eurasia Group said the Commerce Department was expected to set a 90-day grace period this week. Department officials did not immediately return phone calls and emails seeking comment.\n\nIn a report, Eurasia Group said that if the Commerce Department sanction process helps persuade European carriers to shun Huawei equipment, a full ban on purchases of U.S. technology products and services could be avoided.\n\nGoogle, a unit of Alphabet Inc., said in a statement late Sunday that it was complying with and \"reviewing the implications\" of the requirement for export licenses for technology sales to Huawei, which took effect Thursday.\n\n\"For users of our services, Google Play and the security protections from Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices,\" it added.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to questions about whether it planned to request Commerce Department approval to be able to continue to provide Huawei with the value-added services and apps that have made Android the world's most popular mobile operating system.\n\nBen Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said it's unclear what Google has told Huawei, but any disruption in getting updates to software would have \"considerable implications\" for its consumer device business.\n\nThe U.S. government says Chinese suppliers including Huawei and its smaller rival, ZTE Corp., pose an espionage threat because they are beholden to China's ruling Communist Party. But American officials have presented no evidence of any Huawei equipment serving as intentional conduits for espionage by Beijing.\n\nHuawei, headquartered in the southern city of Shenzhen near Hong Kong, reported earlier that its worldwide sales rose 19.5% last year over 2017 to 721.2 billion ($105.2 billion). Profit rose 25.1% to 59.3 billion yuan ($8.6 billion).\n\nHuawei smartphone shipments rose 50% in the first three months of 2019 to 59.1 million, compared with a year earlier, while the global industry's total fell 6.6%, according to IDC. Shipments from Samsung and Apple both declined.\n\nHuawei defended itself Monday as \"one of Android's key global partners.\" The company said it helped to develop a system that \"benefited both users and the industry.\"\n\n\"We will continue to build a safe and sustainable software ecosystem, in order to provide the best experience for all users globally,\" the company said.\n\nA foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, said China will \"monitor the development of the situation\" but gave no indication how Beijing might respond.\n\nThe U.S. order took effect Thursday and requires government approval for all purchases of American microchips, software and other components globally by Huawei and 68 affiliated businesses. Huawei says that amounted to $11 billion in goods last year.\n\nThat could certainly create some collateral damage for U.S. companies.\n\nThe California chipmaker Xilinx Inc. tumbled 4% Monday. David Wong, an analyst with Nomura, said Xilinx has benefited from demand in next-generation, 5G technologies and \"action against a major maker of communications infrastructure equipment like Huawei likely poses risk for Xilinx.\"\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Google's move will have its biggest effect in places like Europe where it has emerged as a big smartphone seller. Other companies will inevitably follow. In effect, the move puts pressure on Huawei's international expansion dreams.\n\nIf China and the United States have begun a technological Cold War, then the Huawei order can best be seen as the beginnings of a digital Iron Curtain. In this potential vision of the future of technology, China will continue to keep out much of the world. The United States and many other countries, goes this thinking, will in turn block Chinese technology.\n\nThe tougher American stance is closing off many of the ways that the United States and China exchanged ideas and did business despite the strict Chinese censorship regime. Those closed doors could have profound effects on not only the business of technology, but also on how the world will use and understand the devices and services of the future.\n\nAlready, China's censorship and tight control of its citizens' digital lives have effectively isolated one-fifth of the world's internet-using population, giving rise to a generation that doesn't know what it means to Google something or to subscribe to a YouTube channel.\n\nThe aggressive new stance by the United States will only speed up that process, opening a potential window to a day when Chinese people can use only Chinese phones and gadgets powered by homegrown chips and software. It is far from clear whether those Chinese platforms of tomorrow will be able to interact freely with the rest of the world.\n\nAll this is happening with a speed that has shocked many in China.\n\n\"The move by the Trump administration is much more comprehensive than many Chinese expected,\" said Nicole Peng, an analyst at technology research firm Canalys. \"It also came much earlier. Many people only realize now that it's for real.\"\n\nIt is far from clear whether the Trump administration's moves will truly isolate Huawei from the rest of the world. The White House has struggled to persuade other countries to stop buying Huawei's telecommunications equipment, citing potential espionage concerns. (Huawei denies that it spies for the Chinese government.) Huawei has already developed its own chips and other capabilities, and has said that it has stockpiled equipment for a day when it would lose access to American know-how and equipment.\n\nThe attack on Huawei is also taking place against the backdrop of a worsening trade war, making it one piece on a larger game board. Just like last year, when the White House relented on a similar order that crippled Huawei rival's ZTE, the United States could lift its pressure on Huawei to ease tensions between Washington and Beijing.\n\nChina has ways it could retaliate. On Monday, China's state media reported that Xi Jinping, China's top leader, visited a site that mines and processes rare earths, which are essential minerals for a number of manufacturers. His visit was a none-too-subtle reminder that China has a commanding presence in rare earths and could shut off global supplies -- something it has done once before.\n\nThe digital Iron Curtain has been long in the making. From its earliest days dealing with the internet, the Chinese government has squelched content it didn't like. Today, the Chinese internet at first glance doesn't look much like the one the rest of the world uses. It has different platforms, ideals and business strategies, all tended carefully by censors.\n\nBut the wall was mostly one-sided. American chips and software power Chinese servers and mainframes. China has been a big revenue driver for Apple, Oracle, Intel, Qualcomm and other big names in tech. Much of this was by necessity, since China couldn't make all this stuff itself, but it still gave American companies a role in the direction of the Chinese digital future.\n\nThe ties go deeper. Many of the founders of China's most successful technology companies were educated in the United States. American investors helped them get established, and some of those Chinese companies turned around and invested in American companies. Academics from the two countries regularly teamed up and swapped notes.\n\nNow the United States, concerned about securing intellectual property, is working to block some of those channels. It has tightened limits on Chinese investment in American companies. Some Chinese students who focused on science and technology have had problems getting visa to the United States. Some Chinese scholars have had their American visas revoked over spying fears.\n\nWith the Huawei limits, the Trump administration cited safety. The Commerce Department announced last week that it had placed Huawei and its dozens of affiliates on a list of firms deemed a risk to national security. The listing will prevent Huawei from buying American parts and technologies without seeking United States government approval.\n\nThe executive order, which came after the U.S.-China trade talks collapsed earlier this month, could ripple through all parts of Huawei's business. It has said that American suppliers account for nearly one-fifth of its procurement spending. Even small parts could be crucial. Nobody wants to buy a high-end Huawei router that is only 95 percent complete.\n\nBut in international expansion, companies like Google give Huawei a common platform for customers outside China. Its phones come loaded with Google Play, the app and media store, as well as popular apps like Gmail and YouTube. Its license to use Android gives Huawei access to security updates and new features.\n\nWithout Google's cooperation, Huawei would have to come up with its own version of Android or use its own homegrown operating system. Many customers in places like Europe would rather not deal with that fuss. China has been trying to build its own operating systems over the past three decades but has not much success.\n\nIn China, many people see the American moves as a naked ploy to stop a rising Chinese competitor. The United States can't beat Huawei's innovation and moxie, goes this thinking, so it will use the power of government to keep a Chinese rival down.\n\nOthers in China point to the country's own barriers against competitors as a strategy that was going to provoke retaliation sooner or later. At some point, the United States was bound to use reciprocity in dealing with a closed Chinese internet market. One popular blog post explained that reciprocity has been translated into \"mutual benefit\" in Chinese, which explains why many in China didn't understand that the idea could be used in retaliation.\n\nAnother popular blog post drives the point even more clearly.\n\n\"You're been opposing the U.S. for many years,\" said the headline. \"You should be long prepared that the U.S. will oppose you one day.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "li_yuan@nytimes.com", "name": "Li Yuan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/20/business/20newworld/20newworld-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "spa-1545637", "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 296063700}, {"uri": "1140600208", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-29", "time": "14:16:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-20T14:16:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.772549033164978, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/20/google-cuts-off-huawei-after-trump-administration-crackdown/", "title": "Google cuts off Huawei after Trump administration crackdown", "body": "Android logo is displayed on a Huawei smartphone in this illustration picture May 20, 2019. REUTERS/Marko Djurica/Illustration (Marko Djurica/Reuters) By Hamza Shaban Hamza Shaban Technology reporter May 20 at 10:00 AM\n\nGoogle is restricting future business with Huawei, cutting off access to its Android operating system and its popular apps, after the Trump administration escalated a crackdown on the Chinese tech firm.\n\nGoogle's suspension, first reported by Reuters, amounts to a major blow to the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, which will no longer receive access and support for Google's proprietary apps like Gmail, YouTube and Chrome.\n\nThe open source version of Android will still be available to Huawei, according to the report, but the Chinese tech giant will immediately lose access to updates to the operating system. And though existing Huawei users can still download popular Google apps through the Google Play store, they won't be available on future Huawei handsets.\n\nPeople who already own Huawei phones will not see a sudden disappearance of their services.\n\n\"We are complying with the order and reviewing the implications,\" Google said in a statement Monday. \"For users of our services, Google Play and the security protections from Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices.\"\n\nGoogle's suspension is the latest blow against Huawei. Last week, the U.S. government added Huawei to its \"Entity List,\" forcing the company to obtain a U.S. government license to buy American technology. Known to some as the \"death penalty,\" the designation makes it virtually impossible for firms to survive once U.S. businesses cut off their dealings.\n\nThe penalty was seen as a dramatic escalation of the economic clash between the Trump administration and China.\n\nThe Commerce Department said it had initiated the crackdown because Huawei \"is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interest.\" The Department of Justice has also accused it of violating Iran sanctions.\n\nThe listing will have an immediate affect on the telecommunications company, which has significant backing from the Chinese government. Huawei said last week that it spends more than $1 out of every $7 of its annual $70 billion procurement budget buying equipment from U.S. companies. The ban could also hinder Huawei's ability to produce its latest equipment since the company relies on U.S. suppliers for components including wireless chips, antennas and handset operating software.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Huawei said it has made \"substantial contributions\" to Android's global ecosystem; 2.5 billion devices around the world run on Android. The company said it will continue to provide security updates and after-sales services to owners of its smartphones and tablets.\n\nAccording to data released before the U.S. government listing, Huawei claimed 19 percent of the global smartphone market, the research firm IDC said, behind only Samsung's 23.1 percent, which was on the decline.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/COcGSsnyRC6k1DNASPXXB4p9uhg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RYW5USD3AEI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg", "eventUri": "spa-1545637", "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 296057760}, {"uri": "1140578107", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-20", "time": "13:47:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-20T13:47:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-technology-202/2019/05/20/the-technology-202-sen-josh-hawley-has-a-new-bill-to-let-consumers-opt-out-of-pervasive-tracking/5ce2298aa7a0a435cff8c0d7/", "title": "Analysis | The Technology 202: Sen. Josh Hawley has a new bill to let consumers opt out of pervasive tracking", "body": "Sen. Josh Hawley wants to make opting out of online tracking as easy as adding your number to the \"Do Not Call\" list.\n\nHawley, a Missouri Republican, will introduce legislation on Tuesday to create a \"Do Not Track\" program: It would require companies to limit data collection on Americans who check a setting in their web browsers or install a special app on their phones.\n\nIt would also impose hefty fines on companies that, after people opt out, continue the controversial but pervasive practice of collecting broad data about consumers' browsing activity or building highly customized profiles about them. Such profiles are commonly used to serve targeted advertisements.\n\nPast initiatives to create \"Do Not Track\" options have failed to stop companies' tracking because they were voluntary, Hawley said, promising this bill would have teeth and finally give consumers more control over how business uses their data.\n\n\"We've tried the voluntary model,\" Hawley said in an interview. \"It's time to stop this two-step.\"\n\nHawley is pushing for this legislation as he aims to raise awareness on Capitol Hill about the shadowy ways companies follow consumers online -- sometimes collecting data about consumers even after they think they've opted out. Hawley, a freshman, is making it his mission to fight Big Tech on Capitol Hill, and the fines he's proposing are the latest signal that Washington is seeking tougher penalties against Silicon Valley.\n\nHawley also thinks a Do Not Track initiative should be part of any federal privacy legislation. The senator made waves in Congress on this issue after a fiery exchange Google executive Will DeVries earlier this year, when Hawley slammed the company for collecting location data about Android users even when location history is turned off. His office says this bill also stems from concerns about Facebook's practice of collecting data from people online even if they don't have an account with the service, which is known in the industry as building \"shadow profiles.\"\n\nHawley's bill does not yet have any co-sponsors, but it's likely an issue that could earn support across the aisle. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) introduced similar legislation in 2011 though the bill languished in Congress. The Obama administration's Federal Trade Commission also supported the creation of a Do Not Track setting -- but it ultimately did not result in any requirements.\n\nHawley thinks that this bill will be able to succeed where the Obama-era initiative fell short. The FTC at the time created a working group to develop a Do Not Track button, but it leaned heavily on the tech industry to come up with the best way to implement Do Not Track. It turned acrimonious as there was infighting within the group about what \"tracking\" means.\n\nBrowser makers like Microsoft and Mozilla have also tried to implement Do Not Track buttons, which notify advertisers and websites that a person does not want to be tracked. But there's currently no way to enforce it, and advertisers can continue to track people even with the setting enabled.\n\nThat's why Hawley thinks there needs to be an actual law on the books. His bill would also restrict companies from transferring the data they collect about consumers to other companies if they activate Do Not Track. Companies would also have to let consumers know they have these privacy rights to opt out of such tracking.\n\nIf companies knowingly fail to comply with these rules, they could face penalties of up to $1,000 per day per person. But to be sure the fines pack a punch -- the minimum fine for violations is not less than $100,000. Even if companies are found not to knowingly break the law, they would face penalties of $50 per day per person for negligence.\n\nTo be sure, recent history shows that efforts to get companies to change their behavior are tricky. A model for this legislation -- the Do Not Call registry -- was created in 2003 to help consumers limit unwanted calls they are receiving from telemarketers. But it has proved ineffective in protecting them from an onslaught of robocalls in recent years.\n\nHawley says he's encouraged by the prospects of change as there's been a significant shift in attitudes toward the tech industry in Washington -- and scrutiny of privacy issues in both parties.\n\n\"There is a dawning awareness these big tech companies pose a new but unique threat to consumer privacy, free speech and the future of our economy that we're just beginning to get our hands and our heads around,\" Hawley told me.\n\nBITS: Google halted its business with Huawei that requires the transfer of hardware, software and technical services, except when available via open source, according to Angela Moon of Reuters. The move follows a decision by the Trump administration last week to add Huawei to the \"entities list,\" which could effectively blacklist Huawei from working with U.S. suppliers.\n\n\"We are complying with the order and reviewing the implications,\" a Google spokesperson told Reuters.\n\n\"For users of our services, Google Play and the security protections from Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices,\" the spokesperson also told Reuters, without giving further details.\n\nCurrent holders of Huawei smartphones with Google apps will still be able to download apps and updates, according to Reuters. But Huawei will immediately lose access to Google's Android operating system. Future versions of the phones running Android will also lose common Google-operated apps, such as YouTube and Gmail.\n\nChipmakers including Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc. Xilinx Inc. and Broadcom Inc. have told their employees they will not supply Hawei until further notice, according to Bloomberg's Ian King, Mark Bergen and Ben Brody.\n\nNIBBLES: U.S. intelligence officials have been briefing Silicon Valley technology executives about the risks of doing business in China, according to The Verge's James Vincent.\n\nThe briefings -- held with tech companies, universities and venture capitalists in California and Washington -- include warnings about the threat of cyber attacks and the theft of intellectual property. They're the latest signal of the tensions between the U.S. government and Beijing.\n\n\"The Chinese government and Communist party pose the greatest long-term threat to US economic and national security,\" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told the Financial Times about the briefings, which he helped organize. \"It's important that US companies, universities, and trade organizations understand fully that threat.\"\n\nThe intelligence officials are at times sharing classified information in the briefings, which began last October.

Google's decision to halt work with Huawei was first reported by Reuters.\n\nIn isolating Huawei, the Trump administration is escalating a trade dispute with Beijing and harming a company that the American authorities have long accused of posing a national security risk -- charges that Huawei has vehemently denied. After struggling to convince allies like Britain and Germany to block the use of Huawei telecommunications equipment, the Trump administration is now undermining Huawei's business by cutting off its access to crucial American suppliers, including chip makers.\n\nIn complying with the Commerce Department's order, Google is undercutting ties with an important and fast-growing partner. Huawei's sales in the first quarter of 2019 grew 50 percent compared to the same period a year earlier, even as the broader smartphone market stagnated, according to the market research firm IDC.\n\nWhile Huawei products have effectively been blocked in the United States for years, the company's business has grown rapidly in Africa, Asia and Europe, where its affordable prices have been embraced by consumers and by phone companies that use its antennas, base stations and other equipment to make wireless networks.\n\nPresident Trump last week issued a ban on American telecommunications firms' installing foreign-made equipment that could pose a threat to national security. The order instructed the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, to stop transactions \"posing an unacceptable risk.\" While it did not single out any company by name, the order was widely believed to be aimed at Huawei and others in China's tech sector.\n\nOn the same day, the Commerce Department added Huawei to a list of companies deemed a risk to national security, effectively preventing the company from buying American parts and technologies without special permission from Washington. Since then, chip makers including Infineon, Intel and Qualcomm have told employees to cease working with Huawei until further notice, according to Bloomberg and other news outlets. Intel declined to comment, while Qualcomm and Infineon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nOn Monday, shares in Infineon, which is based in Germany, fell more than 4 percent.\n\nHuawei has not yet said how it will respond to the Trump administration order, but the Chinese government on Monday suggested a legal challenge.

(Mark Ralston/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images)\n\nIn the wake of Russia's election interference campaign in 2016, there's a new wave of political candidates who are betting their cybersecurity expertise can help deliver them into office.\n\nDigital security hasn't traditionally been a big stumping point for politicians -- or a core part of their backgrounds. But several state-level candidates are making it central to their pitch to voters, arguing that states are on the front lines facing Russian hackers trying to undermine their elections and cybercriminals trying to steal citizens' personal data -- and those states need elected officials with cybersecurity know-how to protect them.\n\n\"This is a threat to our democracy, so it's important that we have elected officials who not only understand the importance of cyberthreats but understand the minutiae well enough to legislate on it,\" said Hala Ayala, a Democratic member of Virginia's House of Delegates who is running for a state Senate seat this year.\n\n\"People with my background live this every day,\" said Ayala, who spent 18 years as an information security specialist in the U.S. Coast Guard before entering politics. \"It behooves us to elect people who understand this evolving threat and can help us better prepare for it.\"\n\nSheri Donahue, who's running for Kentucky state auditor as a Democrat, compared her pitch to voters to a lawyer who runs on his familarity with criminal law or a doctor who says he knows how to reform the healthcare system.\n\n\"We need to have people with a background and understanding of these things,\" said Donahue, who was formerly a top official at InfraGard, an organization that shares cybersecurity threat information between the FBI and the private sector. \"In [industry], they're starting to elevate [chief security officers] and [chief information security officers] so they have a seat at the table. We need to make sure we have that at the state level too.\"\n\nLaura Galante, who runs her own cybersecurity firm and is running for the Virginia House of Delegates, also thinks she can help lawmakers take bolder action on election security. While campaigning in her rural district, though, she said she mostly uses her technology background to talk about the need for rural broadband and other local issues.\n\n\"Especially in the last few weeks after the Mueller report, it's been very clear that election systems and state assets are being targeted,\" Galante, who was formerly director of global intelligence for the cybersecurity firm FireEye, said of the special counsel's report on Russian election interference. \"So having a legislature that's able to actually look in and question security practices that are being put in place at a state level is very useful.\"\n\nThey were all endorsed by 314Action, a group that supports candidates at the federal, state and local level who have a background in science, technology, engineering and math. Among the candidates the group endorsed in 2018 were Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), a computer programmer, and Reps. Kim Shrier (D-Wash.), a pediatrician, and Joe Cunningham (D-N.C.), an ocean engineer.\n\nThe group is officially nonpartisan but the vast majority of the candidates it endorses who have a party affiliation are running as Democrats, President Shaughnessy Naughton told me. That's largely because the group refuses to endorse candidates that don't take a strong position on combating climate change, she said.\n\nNaughton, a chemist, founded 314Action in July 2016 following an unsucessful run for Congress as a Democrat in Pennsylvania. Since the 2016 election, she said, she's seen a surge of interest from technologist candidates who want to help keep elections secure and stem the spread of disinformation online.\n\n\"These are complicated issues and we need folks who understand them,\" she said.\n\nDonahue told me she's gotten a lot of interest from Kentucky voters when she talks about election security -- regardless of who they voted for as president in the 2016 contest. One of her key pitches, she said, is that she wants to expand state audits of the cybersecurity of election equipment.\n\nThe voters, she said, are even familiar with what was once a fringe security issue on the campaign trail. \"When I mention auditing voting machines, that resonates with people almost unanimously,\" Donahue told me. \"I tell them we have to make sure our votes count, and we have to make sure our adversaries aren't tampering with our election and there's resounding approval.\"\n\nDonahue is also pitching herself to voters as someone who can protect state and county networks from the scourge of ransomware -- a type of malicious software that hackers use to lock up computer systems until the victims pay a fee -- and which has compromised municipal networks in Atlanta, Baltimore and elsewhere in recent years to the tune of millions of dollars.\n\n\"We have 120 counties in Kentucky and we can't afford to pay $400,000 in ransom for 120 counties,\" Donahue told me.\n\nAyala's district in Prince William County is just an hour outside Washington and includes a lot of federal employees whose personal information was compromised in the 2015 Office of Personnel Management breach. So, it's pretty easy to convince those voters that state government should be doing more to protect citizens' personal data, she told me.\n\nThose ideas have been a tougher sell at the capitol in Richmond, however. Since she was first elected in 2017, she has sponsored bills to increase cybersecurity training for state employees and to lower the threshold at which Virginia businesses have to disclose data breaches -- neither of which became law.\n\n\"When I first started to talk about it, you could see a glazed-over look,\" she said, \"but the conversation's evolving.\"\n\nPINGED: Google suspended some of its business with Huawei this weekend, Reuters's Angela Moon reported -- a major blow that will make it far harder for the Chinese telecom that is suspected of spying for Beijing to compete globally.\n\nThe move marks the most substantial result of a Commerce Department order last week that described Huawei as a threat to national security and barred U.S. companies from supplying it with certain components.\n\n\"The move could hobble Huawei's smartphone business outside China as the tech giant will immediately lose access to updates to Google's Android operating system,\" Moon reported. \"The next version of its Android smartphones will also lose access to popular services including the Google Play Store and Gmail and YouTube apps.\"\n\nHuawei, meanwhile, shot back at the order in a New York Times opinion column by Catherine Chen, director of the company's board.\n\nThe \"ban will not make American networks more secure,\" Chen wrote. \"Instead, it will hurt ordinary Americans and businesses by denying them access to leading technology, reducing competition and increasing prices.\"\n\nChen added that \"the ban will financially harm the thousands of Americans employed by the U.S. companies that do business with Huawei, which buys more than $11 billion in goods and services from U.S. companies each year [and] ... could eliminate tens of thousands of American jobs.\"\n\nPATCHED: European Union governments agreed this weekend on a plan to impose joint sanctions on hackers and the organizations that support them, the Wall Street Journal's Laurence Norman reported.\n\nThe agreement comes as the United States is lobbying allies in Europe and elsewhere to impose joint penalties on nations that violate rules of the road in cyberspace -- especially Russia and China.\n\n\"The introduction of sanctions was pushed by the Dutch and British, who have blamed Russia for some recent cyberattacks on the bloc,\" Norman reported.\n\n\"People or entities suspected of significant cyberattacks, or attempted cyberattacks, originating outside the bloc would face a ban on travel to the EU and a freeze on their assets,\" Norman reported. \"The sanctions can also target people who provide financial or technical support for such attacks.\"\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt praised the new sanctions regime on Twitter - and told Russia to take note.\n\nPWNED: Someone appears to have hacked into a computer system maintained by the U.S. Golf Association and altered records to give President Trump embarrassing scores, my colleague Colby Itkowitz reported.\n\n\"It appears someone obtained access to Trump's page and posted awful scores of 101, 100, 108 and 102,\" Colby reported, citing a story in Golfweek. \"Par in a round of golf is typically around 72, and Trump has traditionally posted more flattering scores in the 70s and 80s, which some skeptics say are not a true indicator of his golf game.\"\n\nThe U.S. Golf Association has removed the erroneous records and is launching an investigation, Colby reported.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/ac5010f67026989716cc743b36024bc0-2972-2000-70-8-DPJ5WSTQKMI6THVUBAUPKOEQCM.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 296049420}, {"uri": "1140076151", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-19", "time": "22:46:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-19T22:46:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-trump-administration-owes-the-public-answers-about-its-restrictions-on-huawei/2019/05/19/582a4748-78bc-11e9-b7ae-390de4259661_story.html", "title": "Opinion | The Trump administration owes the public answers about its restrictions on Huawei", "body": "By Editorial Board May 19 at 6:23 PM\n\nCHINESE TELECOMMUNICATIONS giant Huawei's global influence has been steadily growing in recent years, and the U.S. government's concern has been growing along with it. Fearing that the spread of Chinese-made cellphones, routers and other equipment may render Western countries, including those that share the most sensitive intelligence with the United States, vulnerable to Beijing, Washington has tried to hold Huawei accountable for alleged sanctions violations and intellectual property theft -- while discouraging key allies such as Britain, Australia and New Zealand from relying on Huawei technology.\n\nWhat's ultimately at stake here is the future of 5G\u2009networks around the world -- the ultra-fast connection systems that will soon link smartphones, enable driverless automobiles and, potentially, revolutionize warfare. Given the stakes, U.S. measures to date struck us as reasonable.\n\nNow the Trump administration has escalated to a new level, requiring that all U.S. firms seek federal approval before selling to Huawei. Though not an outright ban on sales, it is a major restriction because Huawei's products rely on inputs purchased from no fewer than 30 U.S. companies, and now those will be subject to government licensing. Huawei says it has stockpiled 12 months' supply of U.S.-made inputs in anticipation of just such a move. Depending on how it's implemented, however, the U.S. policy represents a potentially crippling blow to a $100 billion corporation that Beijing considers its national champion.\n\nThe communist government's protective attitude toward Huawei reflects not only the company's commercial success but also its long-standing connections to the Chinese state. In fact, Huawei's founder is a former military officer, and the enterprise grew with the support of government contracts and easy government credit. A 2017 Chinese law requires Huawei and all other firms and individuals to cooperate with government intelligence agencies; in January, Poland arrested a Chinese executive of Huawei on espionage charges. When Canada arrested Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in response to a U.S.\u2009extradition request for allegedly violating sanctions on Iran, China retaliated by arresting Canadians -- not exactly the reaction you'd expect from a government that held Huawei at arm's length.\n\nStill, neither the United States nor any of its allies has produced a \"smoking gun\" proving that Chinese intelligence uses Huawei technology to penetrate other countries' networks. Under the circumstances, it is legitimate for the United States to seek greater transparency from Huawei, both about its ownership and its strategic objectives in the global market. To the extent that the Trump administration's latest step is an attempt to bolster its negotiating position on those issues, it may be justified. If it represents a deliberate attempt to bring down Huawei and provoke a broader economic rupture with China, it may not. In that sense, the administration owes the public more transparency about its intentions, as well.\n\nJosh Rogin: China is using the Washington swamp against us\n\nJohn Pomfret: A deeper tech concern is at the core of the U.S.-Huawei spat\n\nTom Cotton and John Cornyn: Keep the Chinese government away from 5G technology\n\nThe Post's View: U.S. allies should heed the warnings about Huawei\n\nLetters to the Editor: Huawei will never violate our customers' trust", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aPjPXb6BipVKTWj_wyMHdQSd7wY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JVVEHST2MEI6TC5XB7DZNTZOYA.jpg", "eventUri": "spa-1545637", "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 296001960}, {"uri": "1140005792", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-19", "time": "19:45:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-19T19:45:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4980392158031464, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/as-trump-escalates-china-trade-dispute-economic-ties-lose-stabilizing-force-in-matters-of-national-security/2019/05/19/61d50abc-78da-11e9-ac17-284a66782c41_story.html", "title": "As Trump escalates China trade dispute, economic ties lose stabilizing force in matters of national security", "body": "By Paul Sonne Paul Sonne National security reporter focusing on the U.S. military May 19 at 2:59 PM\n\nThe United States for years relied on economic interdependence with China as a stabilizing force in relations with Beijing, with business between the two nations forming what former treasury secretary Hank Paulson used to call the \"ballast\" in U.S.-China affairs.\n\nBut as President Trump escalates his trade dispute with Chinese President Xi Jinping, there is a realization that those days are gone. The result is a reduced incentive for stability and restraint in Washington when it comes to China, raising the possibility that tensions could extend beyond the trade sphere and impact other areas of contention, including Taiwan or the South China Sea.\n\n\"The way a lot of people have been talking about this is that you have lost, or you're losing, the ballast,\" said Zack Cooper, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a former official in the George W. Bush administration. \"The challenge now is that there is not much of a constituency that wants to protect the relationship amidst trade tensions, security concerns and human rights concerns.\"\n\nThe U.S. military is expressing growing alarm about China's defense buildup. Human rights advocates are crying foul over China's use of surveillance technology and internal reeducation camps for Muslims. And some American business executives, who once prized China and advocated for a more conciliatory stance toward Beijing, say they feel stung by what they see as unfair practices, ranging from intellectual-property theft to rules that require partnerships with local Chinese entities.\n\n[After tariff threats, many Chinese see Trump as a Marvel villain out to destroy them]\n\nUnderpinning the growing strain is a sense among many Americans, harnessed by Trump during the 2016 presidential election, that China is not playing fair, and the time has come for Washington to shift the balance. While Trump has focused on trade, raising the stakes in recent days by applying 25 percent tariffs to billions of dollars in Chinese goods, his administration's tougher line has extended to national security, too. The Pentagon's defense strategy calls for \"great power competition\" that aims to prevent China from achieving any substantive military advantage.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration added the Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei to the U.S. Commerce Department's \"entity list,\" making it difficult for the Chinese firm to do business with any American company. The Commerce Department said Huawei \"is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interest.\" The dispute over Huawei demonstrated the confluence of Washington's economic and national security concerns.\n\n\"Putting these in two completely separate boxes -- and saying we have to maintain close economic ties even as we compete in the national security realm -- I don't think that's possible anymore,\" said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"I don't think that we have the strong support from the business community that used to exist for this relationship. To me, the playing field has changed so fundamentally.\"\n\nStill, the United States and China have developed a complex and robust economic relationship that dates to the normalization of diplomatic ties four decades ago. Today, the United States imports more than half a trillion dollars in Chinese goods per year, underscoring the extent to which both nations have hitched their economic futures to each other and melded their supply chains in the decades since the diplomatic breakthrough of 1979.\n\nThat reality raises a broader question about the Trump administration's approach to the world's second-biggest economy: How can the United States execute full-fledged \"great power competition\" with China, the likes of which Washington has not seen since the Cold War, when the nations remain so economically intertwined?\n\nThe conundrum highlights one of the key differences between the Cold War and the burgeoning competition between the United States and China. The United States and the Soviet Union had few economic and trade links in the decades after World War II. The U.S. policy of containment, as the late diplomat George F. Kennan put it, ultimately sought to cause the \"breakup or the gradual mellowing of Soviet power.\" Any such containment policy with China would carry great economic risks for the United States.\n\n\"While I understand the appeal of thrusting China into a role of Soviet Union 2.0, thrusting or forcing China into that role would lead us toward a very misguided goal of containment,\" said Ali Wyne, a policy analyst at Rand Corp. \"China is far more powerful economically than the Soviet Union ever was.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has sent mixed messages about what it is seeking to achieve long term with its trade and national security policies on China. Some officials, including Trump at times, suggest economic ties with China will continue apace and possibly even deepen, so long as Beijing agrees to new, fairer rules. Others emphasize American resolve to restrain China's unfair expansionism and end the economic linkages that have been fueling its rise.\n\n\"For some sides of the administration, the purpose of the tariffs was to build leverage so as to pressure China to open its markets to American businesses, thereby deepening the U.S.-China relationship,\" said Ely Ratner, director of studies at the Center for a New American Security, who was previously an adviser to former vice president Joe Biden. \"Others see economic interdependence as a huge vulnerability and a problem that needs to be solved. Is the goal a more reciprocal economic relationship or is it one that's less interdependent?\"\n\nRatner said he didn't expect the worsening trade relations necessarily to result in more Chinese aggression in Taiwan or the South China Sea. He said the question is more on the U.S. side -- whether the failure to reach a trade deal will prompt the Trump administration to unleash harsher measures against China that until now it has been holding back in the interest of striking a deal. He said those measures could extend to the national security space -- for instance, with more a more muscular U.S. military presence in the South China Sea.\n\nPaulson, the former Goldman Sachs executive and treasury secretary under George W. Bush, is no longer describing business as the \"ballast\" in U.S.-China relations. These days, he is warning of an \"economic iron curtain\" that could descend between the United States and China, noting the risks that entails for the American economy. One reason, he said in a speech in February, is that \"national security concerns are now bleeding into virtually every aspect of our economic relationship.\"\n\n\"The problem with applying a blunt hammer is that it can end up breaking everything,\" Paulson said. \"If you aim to hurt others but end up hurting yourself, you cannot always recover for a second chance.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iU8tRrNlRIw8NOCeigLU_-vrD4Q=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/67KQH7RQUYI6TAJ2BKZPC7RQLM.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4796639", "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 295991100}, {"uri": "1139386471", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-18", "time": "18:00:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-18T18:00:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/business/the-week-in-business-facial-recognition-trade-boeing-iran.html", "title": "The Week in Business: A Facial Recognition Ban, and Trade War Blues", "body": "Want this column in your inbox?

Trump's new tech sector order could ripple through global supply chains.", "body": "A Chinese man is silhouetted near the Huawei logo in Beijing. (Ng Han Guan/AP) By Graham Webster May 18 at 12:18 PM\n\nThe gloves are coming off against Chinese tech giant Huawei. The Trump administration took two major steps on Wednesday to address long-standing U.S. government concerns about national security and information technology infrastructure from China.\n\nThe timing and content of the announcements makes it less likely the United States and China will soon reach a trade and economic agreement. And the potentially devastating effects on Huawei in particular could create ripple effects throughout global technology supply chains and hasten any potential \"decoupling\" between Chinese and U.S. tech ecosystems.\n\n[The Huawei arrest fallout leaves companies and countries with an impossible choice]\n\nThe U.S. government just claimed far-reaching powers over the tech sector\n\nIn the first of two major announcements Wednesday, the administration released an \"Executive Order on Securing the Information and Communications Technology [ICT] and Services Supply Chain.\" While many analysts consider this primarily a move to hem in Huawei, the broadly framed order gives the secretary of commerce and other officials extraordinary new powers over tech markets.\n\nThe U.S. government now can block or require conditions for transactions involving ICT products or services even tenuously linked to a \"foreign adversary\" - a category the executive order defines flexibly as a country, company or person \"engaged in a long-term pattern or serious instances of conduct significantly adverse to\" national security, or to security and safety of U.S. citizens or businesses.\n\nHere's what this means: The U.S. government is charged with stepping in to block or manage any transactions it deems as linked to a \"foreign adversary\" and overly risky for critical infrastructure, national security or the \"digital economy.\" If these terms seem vague, that's because they are.\n\nThe executive order leaves it to Commerce and other officials to identify \"foreign adversaries\" and sensitive transactions. Thus it does not name China or Huawei specifically - but the language largely parallels years of U.S. government warnings about the potential for Huawei equipment to be used for spying or sabotage if installed in sensitive U.S. networks.\n\nPublic warnings date back to a 2012 House Intelligence Committee report that urged against using equipment from Huawei or the smaller Chinese firm ZTE. With this week's order, the U.S. government is fully empowered to block U.S. companies from using Huawei equipment just as work begins on next-generation 5G wireless networks around the world.\n\n[Trump says 'America must win' the 5G race. Here's what you need to know.]\n\nSelling U.S. components to Huawei will be banned without a special license\n\nThe second U.S. move, also on May 15, was the Commerce Department's announcement that it would add Huawei to the government's \"entities list,\" potentially halting the company's access to U.S. suppliers.\n\nCiting Huawei's January indictment for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran, the government notice said U.S. companies will only be allowed to sell products to Huawei with a license, and license applications will start from the \"presumption of denial.\"\n\nIf the government were to deny all Huawei-related licenses, the fallout could be catastrophic for many of the company's product lines, which range from infrastructure-level network gear to smartphones. Here's why: Many of these products use computer chips or other specialized components from U.S. companies, some of which would be hard or impossible to replace with non-U.S. alternatives.\n\nWhen the government last year imposed similar measures against ZTE, the loss of U.S. suppliers led the company to announce a stop to \"major business operations.\" Only after President Trump intervened to reverse that order was ZTE saved from likely collapse.\n\nWhile Huawei may have greater ability to withstand shocks than the ZTE, losing access to U.S. suppliers would be a much larger hit than simply losing out on already-slim sales to the United States.\n\n[China's ZTE has long been on Washington's radar, for quite a few reasons.]\n\nThere are consequential choices ahead\n\nWhen it comes to the broad new regulatory powers of the executive order, the government has 150 days to develop more specific rules for implementation. Officials could structure their efforts in a targeted and transparent way - or they could give themselves broad and opaque authorities. One Department of Homeland Security official reportedly said the government would look broadly at risks, but said, \"I'm hoping we'll be able to narrow.\" Businesses and interest groups will be sure to make their voices heard.\n\nIn the case of Huawei's new life on the entities list, the U.S. government could be generous in issuing licenses to continue sales, or it could effectively block the company from all U.S. suppliers, cutting into the revenue of U.S. companies. Regardless, the uncertainty will encourage Huawei and other Chinese companies to seek alternative suppliers at home or anywhere else U.S. bans would not apply.\n\nHow U.S. officials make these choices will help answer several questions:\n\n1. How fast and how hard will U.S. supplier limitations hit Huawei? The Chinese company has reportedly stockpiled several months to a year's worth of some crucial components, anticipating this potential outcome. And Huawei's subsidiary HiSilicon is one of China's leading developers of semiconductors, though it lags behind the global leaders Huawei may need to replace. Time will reveal any real pressure points.\n\n2. Which U.S. companies stand to lose out, and how badly? Big names such as Qualcomm, Seagate and Intel are among Huawei's top U.S. suppliers, by revenue. But the smaller optical technology company NeoPhotonics, which pulls in 47 percent of its revenue from Huawei sales, according to Reuters data, could be in particular jeopardy.\n\n3. How will this ripple through global telecom providers? One potential goal of the broader U.S. campaign against Huawei could be to undermine confidence in the company's long-term viability. Huawei is currently among the global leaders in 5G equipment. But continued services and upgrades are crucial for network providers, so extra caution among customers worldwide could slow wireless upgrades overall.\n\n4. How will this impact the U.S.-China economic divide? A deal many analysts believed was imminent reportedly fell through last week over China's refusal to commit to revising a number of domestic laws. The decision to ratchet up the anti-Huawei campaign at this particular moment could draw retaliation against U.S. interests - and it risks driving the two sides further apart, while pushing any trade deal further into the future.\n\nIndeed, if the two sides move much further down the path of antagonism, there may be no deal at all. Then again, just as the Trump administration stepped back from the brink with ZTE, it could change course here once again.\n\nDon't miss anything!

That could ultimately backfire on the party, which has staked its legitimacy on generating continuous economic growth.\n\nOn the other hand, if Chinese leaders act too cautiously, they could look inept to a domestic populace that has, in recent years, become more self-assured about China's status as a rising power.\n\nWhat was once starry-eyed enthusiasm for America among many Chinese has given way to sober admiration, if not outright disillusionment, as people have gotten to know the United States better and its problems have come into clearer view.\n\nAccording to the latest nationwide survey by the Pew Research Center, published in 2016, 45 percent of Chinese saw American power and influence as a major threat to their country, up from 39 percent in 2013. More than half of Chinese believed the United States was trying to prevent China from becoming as powerful as America, the survey found.\n\nThat trend may well have accelerated over the past year, which has seen the world's two largest economies go head-to-head in a protracted trade war and a dispute over Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant. The United States has also tightened restrictions on visas for Chinese students and visiting scholars, measures it says are aimed at curbing intellectual property theft and spying.\n\nSuch developments have reinforced the Chinese perception that the United States is deliberately thwarting their country's rightful rise -- leaving China with no choice but to fight back.\n\n\"We are not scared. China has money,\" said Amanda Lin, 36, as she sipped an Americano at a Starbucks in Beijing. She said the Chinese manufacturing company she works for had been badly hit by the latest round of tariffs. \"Perhaps we have to sacrifice a little in the short term, but if we don't fight, then we will suffer more in the longer term,\" she said.\n\nSkepticism about American intentions taps into China's collective memory of the 19th century, when Western powers forcibly opened Chinese ports and carved up the country into spheres of influence. Nowadays, China is a fast-modernizing nation, home to a booming middle class and cutting-edge infrastructure.\n\nBut many Chinese still remember their outrage when the United States accidentally bombed China's embassy in Belgrade in 1999, during the war in the former Yugoslavia. The bombing, which killed three Chinese people, prompted days of violent protests. Two years later, tensions flared again when China detained a United States Navy flight crew after a Chinese fighter and an American spy plane collided in midair.\n\nChina has ratcheted up anti-American propaganda in recent weeks, but its campaign has been comparatively restrained. Still, the authorities, ever wary of unrest that could be turned against the government, are taking few risks.\n\nChen Chun, a liberal political columnist in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, said he was recently pulled in for a meeting with local security officials who urged him to take a more moderate tone in his writings.\n\n\"They said that Chinese people are easily instigated and that emotions can get really complicated,\" Mr. Chen said.\n\n\"On one hand, the authorities want to use nationalism to legitimize their regime,\" he added. \"But if the nationalists spin out of control, it can also affect their power and the system's stability.\"\n\nThe party may also be reluctant to play up China's rivalry with America, knowing that affection here for the United States -- whose Chinese name means \"beautiful country\" -- still runs deep.\n\nAmerican culture is so deeply embedded in China, experts say, that it would be impossible to boycott the country's products, as China has done with goods from Japan and South Korea when tensions with those countries ran high. Many Chinese love their iPhones and lobsters imported from Boston, and are fans of American television hits like \"House of Cards\" and \"Modern Family.\"\n\nThe affinity extends beyond products. Many Chinese still admire America for its education system, strong rule of law and soft-power dominance. Some continue to draw inspiration from the idea of the American dream.\n\n\"The American dream means working hard and achieving your goals one step at a time,\" said Kobe Liu Zhe, 29, a Kobe Bryant superfan in the northeastern city of Harbin who recently made headlines in America after he unknowingly bought the National Basketball Association star's stolen high school jersey. (He later returned it.) \"Kobe Bryant represents that dream.\"\n\nAnd yet, while the United States remains one of the top destinations for Chinese tourists, business travelers and students, the growth in that traffic is slowing. The increase in the number of Chinese visitors to the United States fell sharply from 16 percent in 2016 to only 4 percent in 2017, according to the United States Commerce Department.\n\nThe slowdown has been even more apparent in education. The increase in the number of Chinese students going to America has slowed from a high of nearly 30 percent in 2010 to just 3.6 percent last year, according to the Institute of International Education.\n\nThe decline, experts say, partly reflects a growing belief that America's star is losing its luster.\n\n\"Thirty years ago, a lot of people thought that going to the United States was like going to heaven,\" said Liu Peng, an education consultant in the eastern city of Qingdao. \"But now people think the United States is falling behind while China is growing.\"\n\nEven if a trade deal is reached soon, experts say party leaders are bracing for a prolonged period of competition with America. Preparing public opinion for that future, some say, will require adjusting to the younger generation's increasing cultural confidence.\n\n\"The older generation of Chinese both respect and fear the United States, we were brought up to think America was superior and we were the underdog,\" said Wang Xiaodong, a nationalist writer. \"But the perspective of young Chinese is different. They don't respect you. Nor are they afraid of you.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_qin@nytimes.com", "name": "Amy Qin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/world/19china-lovehate-1/00china-lovehate-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4796639", "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 295860720}, {"uri": "1139004489", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-18", "time": "04:28:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-18T04:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4705882370471954, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/australia-holds-elections-with-labor-party-looking-to-regain-power/2019/05/17/f661d2ea-7705-11e9-a7bf-c8a43b84ee31_story.html", "title": "Australia holds elections with Labor Party looking to regain power", "body": "By A. Odysseus Patrick May 18 at 12:01 AM\n\nSYDNEY -- Climate change, China and a chance at political stability took center stage among Australian voters Saturday with polls suggesting the left-leaning Labor Party was in a strong position to flip the country's leadership.\n\nSuch an outcome would offer a counternarrative to the rise of nationalists and conservative groups across the West and elsewhere.\n\nA Labor victory in Australia also could provide a morale boost for U.S. Democrats and other left-of-center parties around the world, including the British Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn, which has long had close ties to its Australian counterpart.\n\nOn China, it would also put Australia possibly at odds with the United States as the Trump administration steps up tariffs and pressure against Chinese technology giant Huawei.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security said it was adding Huawei to its \"entity list\" over worries of potential -- but unspecified -- security risks. The listing makes it virtually impossible for companies to survive in the U.S. market.\n\nAustralia's government, led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, has placed restrictions on some Chinese investments and effectively banned Huawei from Australia's 5G telecommunications network.\n\nBut Labor leader Bill Shorten has suggested Australia needs to recalibrate its relationship with China, saying Australia must take a more rounded approach in its dealings with Beijing and not only view it \"through the prism of strategic risk.\"\n\nShorten's promises of a wider social safety net, support for renewable energy and government stability -- after six prime ministers in eight years -- have resonated strongly across the country.\n\nThe Labor Party wants Australia to generate half of its electricity from solar, wind and other renewable sources by 2030, a huge shift for a nation with the world's fourth-largest coal reserves and the eighth-biggest natural-gas industry.\n\nLabor's popularity also has been boosted by its foreign policy chief, Penny Ying-Yen Wong, a Malaysia-born lawyer who has a wide following and is seen as a top candidate to become foreign minister.\n\n[Australia's new political star once faced scorn as a gay immigrant]\n\nThe Labor Party has promised more free health care, greater spending on education and tax cuts for the middle and working classes. The wealthy should be forced to pay higher taxes and unions should be given more power, it has said.\n\nThe Liberal and National parties also have pledged to bring tax cuts, although both have been ridiculed for offering much of the reductions until 2024, which would be after at least one more national election.\n\nEnvironmental policies are possibly the biggest difference between the two sides.\n\nTo encourage new sources of power, Labor has promised to subsidize the purchase of solar-panel batteries by individual homes. It also has said it will introduce a compulsory carbon-trading system for some 250 companies responsible for the greatest emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nPollution-emissions standards for vehicles also would be toughened to encourage the purchase of electric cars, a policy the current government says threatens many Australians' love of trucks.\n\nThe election comes just days after the death of one of Australia's transformative political figures, former prime minister Bob Hawke.\n\nHis wife, Blanche d'Alpuget, announced the death Thursday of the 89-year-old Hawke, but did not give a cause. In Hawke's last public statement, he issued an open letter urging voters to support Shorten .\n\nHawke, who served as prime minister from 1983 to 1991, was widely regarded as the most successful Labor politician in Australian history and was known for integrating the country into the global economy, forging alliances with Asian nations and strengthening ties with world powers such as the United States.\n\nRead more\n\nOpinion: Can a politician take on Murdoch's empire?

This week's newsletter features some additional highlights from our conversation. Some of Mr. Trudeau's comments have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\n-- Mr. Trudeau on what mistakes he made in the SNC-Lavalin affair:\n\nOne of the things I don't regret, even though a lot of people criticized me for it, is having taken as much time as I did to get to an eventual decision.\n\nI talked to a number of my predecessors from different parties who expressed how quickly they would turf out of caucus someone who was so openly antagonistic.\n\nBut I really believed that doing politics differently means trying to reconcile differences and trying to hold together people who do agree on the big things. And I spent weeks trying to figure out a constructive path forward. Old-school politics would have been to say: \"O.K., I'm going show strength as a leader, make a decision and move on.\" We gave lots of room for lots of airing of different perspectives and that, I think, is consistent with doing politics differently.\n\n-- On criticisms that he can no longer claim to offer a fresh approach to politics:\n\nI think in terms of the team we have within caucus, they have come through this and we are united as a team more than we ever were.\n\nThere's lots of things that we're doing to try and make sure it never happens again. But it's part of doing things differently that you are learning new mechanisms for handling internal conflict like this.\n\nWe continued to do really big things while the media and opposition were being distracted with this internal disagreement that has been invented and amplified. We're going to stay focused on the things that matter, and I have a tremendous amount of faith in Canadians.\n\n-- On whether he was offended by President Trump's personal attacks:\n\nI don't take things personally. My job is to stand up for Canadians and I will do that regardless of what outbursts happen. I've been in the public eye too long to feel like I can be defined by what anyone else says about me.\n\n-- On relations with the United States:\n\nIt's not a terrible situation. We're not at a particular low in the relationship. I still pick up the phone and talk to President Trump every few weeks on any number of issues and we have a very positive relationship.\n\nWe're very different in our approaches and in our ideologies. But we also know the relationship between the two countries is bigger than any one person and, because of that, we get along as fine as we need to.\n\n-- On anticipating the end of the election campaign:\n\nIt's going to be a fun year. Simple rule of politics: Whoever is actually having more fun, Canadians respond to better. We're doing good things, we're actually having fun. We went through these more difficult moments, and as a team and party we managed to stay positive.\n\nI'm happy about coming to work every day. I'm excited about the challenges we face. This is what democracy is supposed to be: a contrast of ideas and a choice between different visions for this country. And with what we've been able to achieve and what we're continuing to stay focused on, despite some noise.\n\nFinally, a bit of trivia. The closing of Parliament's Centre Block for renovations meant that Mr. Trudeau has moved into a different office in the West Block. It's been widely reported that Mr. Trudeau's father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, used the same office when he was justice minister. But Mr. Trudeau said that he learned from an aunt that his grandfather, James Sinclair, also occupied the high-ceilinged space during the 1950s, when he was fisheries minister.\n\nIn Conversation With Wesley Morris\n\nHaving survived a \"Game of Thrones\" immersion, Wesley Morris, a critic at large for The New York Times and the co-host of \"Still Processing,\" will join the CBC broadcaster and writer Amanda Parris in Toronto on May 28.

But they have escalated the tensions between Canada and China that began to rise with the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer in Vancouver.\n\n-- Conrad M. Black, whose many books include one flattering to Mr. Trump, can travel to the United States again thanks to a presidential pardon.\n\n-- Canada missed a Phippines deadline to take back its garbage from that country. While President Rodrigo Duterte didn't declare war, as he earlier threatened, he did ramp up the pressure on Canada this week.\n\nAround The Times\n\n-- Gen X is getting older, and Styles has put together a package of articles evaluating the loves, hates and myths of an often overlooked generation.\n\n-- \"Getting pregnant is the kiss of death for a female athlete,\" Phoebe Wright, a runner sponsored by Nike from 2010 through 2016, says in a provocative article in Opinion about corporate sponsors and motherhood.\n\n-- Andrew Higgins made his way to Kyrgyzstan, where against seemingly insurmountable odds a community of German-speaking Mennonite Christians has managed to hang on.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_austen@nytimes.com", "name": "Ian Austen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/world/17canadaletter/17canadaletter-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 295824600}, {"uri": "1138653002", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-17", "time": "15:57:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-17T15:57:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4745098054409027, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/opinion/executive-order-china-huawei-ban.html", "title": "Opinion | America Needs Huawei", "body": "An executive order signed by President Trump on Wednesday may lay the groundwork for a ban on the sale of Huawei's equipment in the United States by declaring a \"national emergency.\" Additionally, an order issued by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that goes into effect today will prevent Huawei -- the world's leading telecom equipment provider -- from buying components and technology from American businesses without United States government approval.\n\nThe Commerce Department's decision to require American companies to get special licenses to sell components to Huawei could make it hard -- if not impossible -- for the company to obtain key components for its network switching equipment and smartphones. But a ban will not make American networks more secure. Instead, it will hurt ordinary Americans and businesses by denying them access to leading technology, reducing competition and increasing prices.\n\nThe ban will financially harm the thousands of Americans employed by the U.S. companies that do business with Huawei, which buys more than $11 billion in goods and services from U.S. companies each year. A total ban on Huawei equipment could eliminate tens of thousands of American jobs.\n\nBecause Huawei equipment is installed in dozens of 4G networks in underserved remote and rural parts of the country, a ban would prevent small, independently owned American telecom operators such as Eastern Oregon Telecom and Union Wireless in Wyoming from developing new services and delivering faster broadband connections to millions of people. Instead, those operators would be forced to spend their limited funds replacing Huawei equipment with more expensive gear supplied by its competitors (there are two -- Ericsson and Nokia -- and neither is an American company).\n\nHuawei is the acknowledged industry leader in 5G technology. Blocking it could harm the American economy by preventing the United States from keeping pace with the rest of the world in rolling out 5G networks. The United States could end up falling behind the many European and Asian countries that plan to introduce 5G networks -- ensuring that those countries take the lead in delivering new products and services to their residents, just as American companies did when the country moved quickly to roll out 4G, the previous generation of wireless tech.\n\nMost important, a ban would fail to achieve its goal of making the country's digital networks more secure.\n\nAmerican officials worry that using Chinese equipment would allow Beijing to shut off phones, power, banking and other critical services. The security of our telecommunications networks is a responsibility shared by operators, equipment vendors and service providers to collectively perform risk mitigation with assurance and transparency. Telecom operators control the network and the data moving across it, and circumventing their controls would be extremely hard, given the available risk-mitigation processes. Huawei has repeatedly said it would refuse any order to attack or spy on its customers.\n\nMoreover, singling out Huawei because it is headquartered in China makes little sense. Telecommunications companies such as Nokia and Ericsson draw from a global supply chain, as Huawei does. They use equipment developed or manufactured in China, which accounts for much of the telecommunications and internet gear currently installed in American networks. Blacklisting one company -- or all of the companies from one country -- does nothing to mitigate this global supply chain risk and will substantially reduce competition that will inevitably increase costs.\n\nThe executive order and the Commerce Department's regulation aim to prevent malicious actors from inserting malware into telecommunications networks that could surreptitiously monitor network traffic or launch a cyberattack. This aim reflects the reality that the world's communications networks are vulnerable to attack by sophisticated nation-states, such as by implanting programmable code and exploitable vulnerabilities in hardware and software by virtual means. But such code can compromise the product of any equipment vendor -- even those from countries that might seem friendly to America -- which requires assurance and transparency in risk mitigation.\n\nRelatedMore about China and HuaweiHuawei Is a Target as Trump Moves to Ban Foreign Telecom GearMay 15, 2019Trump's Latest Move Takes Straight Shot at Huawei's BusinessMay 16, 2019Opinion | Bret StephensWhat's Our China Endgame?May 16, 2019\n\nThe United States government has entered into agreements for government-monitored risk mitigation with Nokia and Ericsson, which are based in Europe, allowing them to do business in this country despite their extensive operations in China. Huawei would welcome the opportunity to discuss similar agreements.\n\nIf the White House and Commerce Department really want to protect American networks, they will focus not on barring individual companies but on establishing a comprehensive risk management approach that relies on recognized best practices. In fact, that is precisely the strategy advocated last year by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nA move to block any company -- let alone Huawei, the industry leader -- will weaken competition, delay 5G adoption, reduce innovation and prevent American consumers and businesses from having access to some of the world's most advanced communications technology. The Trump administration should abandon its apparent course and instead develop a transparent framework to test and secure all parts of America's communications networks.\n\nCatherine Chen is director of the board at Huawei.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Genie Back in Its Bottle", "body": "Each week, we review the week's news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nHi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news:\n\n\"The facial recognition genie, so to speak, is just emerging from the bottle,\" Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, wrote in December, when he called for regulation of the technology.\n\nSan Francisco just put it back in.\n\nOn Tuesday, the city's Board of Supervisors banned the use of facial recognition software by the police and other city agencies in an 8-to-1 vote. Supporters said its use by government was an invasion of privacy incompatible with healthy democracy. Departments will now need to first submit proposals and post public notices to use the technology. Private-sector and federal use isn't affected.\n\nThat the ban was introduced by San Francisco, a city pivotal to the development of the technology, was viewed by some as a siren call. \"This is like Detroit banning a certain model of vehicle because it's too dangerous,\" said Alvaro Bedoya, a visiting professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center. \"You may not live in Detroit, but, boy, you'd think twice before getting in that car.\"\n\nExpect more cities to follow: Somerville, Mass., outside Boston, is considering something similar, and Brian Hofer, a paralegal who drafted the San Francisco ordinance, is pushing for other anti-surveillance measures across California.\n\nLike it or not, it's a rare sign that technologies viewed as threats to citizens' well-being can be blocked. \"The decision refutes a defeatist and widespread opinion that once a technology is established, you can't stop it in its tracks,\" said Evan Selinger, a philosophy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology.\n\nMore than an app fight\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court allowed an antitrust class action lawsuit against Apple, giving consumers an opportunity to try to prove that the iPhone maker used monopoly power to raise prices of iPhone apps.\n\nAs my colleagues Adam Liptak and Jack Nicas reported, the lawsuit focuses on the fact that Apple charges developers a commission of up to 30 percent for selling products through its App Store, bars them from selling the apps elsewhere and plays a role in setting prices.\n\nApple claims that it is a middleman: that customers buy software from the app developers. But the court, in a 5-to-4 ruling, said iPhone owners had a \"direct purchaser\" relationship with Apple, so they had the right to sue.\n\nIt's interesting that the decision went against Apple at all. Liberal jurists often favor antitrust action, and conservatives avoid it. So you'd have expected the verdict to be 5-to-4 in the other direction, along the conservative-liberal line of the Supreme Court.\n\nBut the new justice, Brett M. Kavanaugh, tipped the other way.\n\nYou could read Justice Kavanaugh's decision as an indicator that, as people of all political stripes begin to find Big Tech troublesome, conservatives may accept that antitrust could be a useful tool in curbing its power. If that's accurate, Big Tech should be very concerned.\n\nBreaking up Facebook? Godspeed\n\nIn 2019 there's little more fashionable than calling for Facebook's dismantlement.\n\nThis past week, Senator Kamala Harris and Joseph R. Biden Jr., two of the Democrats running for president, said it should be considered, joining another, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has called for wider Big Tech breakups. And don't forget that Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, wrote this month that he wanted its split up, too.\n\nWe could argue (at length) about the validity of the idea. But how plausible is it?\n\nThe weapon of choice behind most of these calls is antitrust law. Fine. There's plenty of potentially anticompetitive behavior to go after. But in terms of end results, a breakup is possible, but by no means certain, from such legal action, according to antitrust experts I spoke with.\n\nEiner Elhauge, a Harvard law professor who was chairman of the antitrust advisory committee to the Obama campaign in 2008, told me that splitting WhatsApp and Instagram from Facebook -- the most popular proposal -- was plausible but might depend on how deeply integrated they had become.\n\n\"It's hard to unscramble eggs,\" he said. And Facebook's push to intertwine the platforms more closely may make such unscrambling only harder.\n\nHarry First, a law professor at New York University who specializes in antitrust, said breaking up what then remained of Facebook would be \"problematic and expensive,\" making it unlikely.\n\nMore skeptical was Diana L. Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, who said that for any antitrust action, \"the remedy has to be applied specifically to the harm; it cannot be a broad remedy.\" That means that \"it may not even include breaking up the company,\" but would instead involve something less severe, like conduct requirements.\n\nMr. First agreed that injunctions and the formal monitoring of conduct were \"much more likely\" outcomes than a breakup.\n\nSo if an antitrust argument is used to break up the social network, it's not guaranteed to have the desired outcome. But, as Mr. First told me, for those who want it, \"it's good to have a goal.\"\n\nTrump's social media priorities\n\nOn Wednesday, more than a dozen countries, including Britain, France and Germany, signed a nine-point plan with big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter to address extremist and violent content. A notable absence: the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration cited free-speech protections for not signing, saying that \"the best tool to defeat terrorist speech is productive speech.\"\n\nThe same day, the White House unveiled a bias reporting tool that enables people to report, to the government, censorship that they believe is a result of political bias on social networks. That thrusts into the public domain a widely held view among Republicans that platforms like Facebook and Twitter censor conservative viewpoints.\n\nAs my colleague Kevin Roose pointed out, that looks like a savvy collection tool for voter data. But it's also an interesting, if not particularly surprising, demonstration of the priorities of the Trump administration.\n\nSome stories you shouldn't miss\n\n\u25a0 Uber bombed its I.P.O.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThe White House hasn't said how it plans to use the data it's collecting about people's experiences with bias on social media. But in Silicon Valley, it's viewed as the administration's latest political stunt.\n\nVenky Ganesan, a partner at technology investor Menlo Ventures, told me the White House's new survey about bias on social media is \"pure kabuki theatre\" and an attempt to curry political points with conservatives. He said the Trump administration's repeated accusations that tech companies censor conservative voices are unfounded because even though most Silicon Valley executives are liberal or libertarian, they wouldn't let politics get in the way of their primary goal: making money.\n\n\"Algorithms and products don't have political biases because that's not how you optimise to make money,\" he wrote in an email. \"The only bias the products have is to monetise users and make money for the companies.\"\n\nThe Internet Association, a trade association representing Facebook, Google and other tech companies, also pushed back on President Trump's repeated accusations that their products are biased against conservatives. The association says the platforms are open and enable the speech of all Americans -- including the president himself.\n\n\"That's why the president uses Twitter so much,\" said Michael Beckerman, the Internet Association's chief executive. \"He actually used Twitter for this particular announcement, which is perhaps ironic.\"\n\nSilicon Valley is punching back as the Trump administration opens a new battleground in its tense war with the tech industry. But this time some of Silicon Valley's typical Washington foes -- privacy advocates and Democrats in Congress -- are on the tech industry's side, underscoring the broad criticism of the plan.\n\nThe Trump administration launched a tool allowing users to submit their experiences with what it described as bias on Wednesday evening, following years of President Trump's repeated threats to regulate the companies for stifling conservative voices. The Trump administration declined to tell my colleague Tony Romm what it planned to do with the data it's amassing. \"The White House wants to hear from all Americans -- regardless of their political leanings -- if they have been impacted by bias on social media platforms,\" spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.\n\nPrivacy advocates want answers about how the data is being handled -- and until they get them, they think the White House should stop using the tool. A consumer privacy nonprofit organization wrote a letter to Trump yesterday calling for the White House to halt the collection of personal information. The White House submission form requests respondents share their name, age, email addresses, phone number, citizenship status and links to their social media profiles and posts.\n\n\"The White House seeks to collect detailed sensitive personal information, yet there is no indication that privacy interests were considered,\" the Electronic Privacy Information Center wrote. The group also said the form raises \"substantial First Amendment concerns\" and that it believes the data collection is \"unlawful, unconstitutional and itself a violation of the First Amendment.\"\n\nEPIC is arguing that the federal agencies are required to conduct a privacy impact assessment before collecting personal data of this nature, and there's no indication the White House conducted such a review before launching the tool.\n\nOn the Hill yesterday, Democratic lawmakers say the survey raises serious questions about government ethics and abuse of power, according to Politico.\n\n\"I think it raises questions related to the abuse of power,\" Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) told reporters on Capitol Hill yesterday. \"If it's not authoritarian, it's the first or second cousin of authoritarianism.\"\n\nBITS: U.S. tech companies could be impacted if a ban on exporting hardware and services to Chinese-based Huawei goes into effect, highlighting U.S. dependence on China's tech industry, my colleagues Greg Bensinger and Reed Albergotti write.\n\nHuaewei says it spends $1 out of every $7 of its annual $70 billion procurement budget buying components from U.S. companies. Huawei relies on U.S. suppliers for wireless chips, antennas and handset operating software -- and the ban could weaken its ability to produce the latest equiptment.\n\nHuawei says the ban, which hasn't yet taken effect, could threaten U.S. jobs.\n\n\"This decision is in no one's interest,\" spokesman Chasen Skinner said in an email to my colleagues. \"It will do significant economic harm to the American companies with which Huawei does business, affect tens of thousands of jobs, and disrupt the current collaboration and mutual trust that exist on the global supply chain.\"\n\nRepresentatives for U.S. suppliers, who did not want to be identified, told my colleagues they were uncertain about the lasting impact of the Huawei ban on their operations.\n\nThose companies would have to apply to the government for special approval to continue supplying Huawei, Center for Strategic and International Studies adviser William Reinsch, a former Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration, told my colleagues.\n\n\"That doesn't mean every license would be denied, but it would be on a case-by-case basis,\" he said. \"It also gives the government an intelligence bonanza\" in the form of a list of every U.S. supplier to Huawei.\n\nNIBBLES: Facebook said it shut down 265 fake accounts run by a social media company in Israel for \"coordinated inauthentic behavior,\" signaling the increasingly global nature of social media disinformation, my colleagues Craig Timberg and Tony Romm report.\n\nFacebook's announcement was atypical because it singled out a company that appeared to profit from its disinformation efforts. Archimedes Group, the affected company, claims the ability to \"use every tool and take every advantage available in order to change reality according to our client's wishes.\"\n\nThe accounts were on Facebook and Instagram, which the social network also owns. Archimedes Group is banned from both services.\n\n\"We're taking down these Pages and accounts based on their behavior, not the content they posted,\" said a post by Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of global cybersecurity policy. \"As in other cases involving coordinated inauthentic behavior, the individuals behind this activity coordinated with one another to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing, and that was the basis for our action.\"\n\nArchimedes Group maintained 65 Facebook accounts, 161 Facebook pages, 23 Facebook groups and four Instagram accounts. It also had posted 12 Facebook events. About 2.8 million accounts followed at least one of the pages set up by the Archimedes Group. Facebook said the company's accounts bought $812,000 in ads using various currencies, dating back to 2012.\n\nArchimedes Group did not respond to a request for comment my colleagues made through its website.\n\nBYTES: More than half a dozen recruiters who recently left Facebook say the company saw a sharp decline in job offer acceptance rates after the public learned of the Cambridge Analytica scandal in March 2018, CNBC's Salvador Rodriguez writes.\n\nStudents at top universities are turning down job offers from the embattled social network at higher rates.\n\n\"Among top schools, such as Stanford, Carnegie Mellon and Ivy League universities, Facebook's acceptance rate for full-time positions offered to new graduates has fallen from an average of 85% for the 2017-2018 school year to between 35% and 55% as of December, according to former Facebook recruiters,\" Rodriguez writes. \"The biggest decline came from Carnegie Mellon University, where the acceptance rate for new recruits dropped to 35%.\"\n\nThe company also saw a decline in acceptance rates among software engineers for its products teams. Acceptance rates for those teams declined from 90% to almost 50% in early 2019.\n\nFacebook spokesman Anthony Harrison told CNBC the company's head count grew 36% year over year from the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019. Facebook disputed the accuracy of the recruiters' accounts, but declined to point out any specific points that were wrong. Harrison contacted CNBC after the story was published to say \"these numbers are totally wrong.\"\n\n\"Facebook regularly ranks high on industry lists of most attractive employers,\" Harrison said in a statement. \"For example, in the last year we were rated as #1 on Indeed's Top Rated Workplaces, #2 on LinkedIn's Top Companies, and #7 on Glassdoor's Best Places to Work. Our annual intern survey showed exceptionally strong sentiment and intent to return and we continue to see strong acceptance rates across University Recruiting.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/19a3a61642101ec360dc266cf76b3f6d-5309-3539-70-8-ZG5R4MDYEMI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4791294", "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 295793640}, {"uri": "1138453374", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-17", "time": "11:41:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-17T11:41:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5882353186607361, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2019/05/17/the-cybersecurity-202-florida-lawmakers-rail-against-fbi-for-secrecy-on-voter-breaches/5cddf475a7a0a435cff8c0a8/", "title": "Analysis | The Cybersecurity 202: Florida lawmakers rail against FBI for secrecy on voter breaches", "body": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and officials from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement were briefed by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security. (Brynn Anderson/AP)\n\nFlorida lawmakers are railing against the FBI for taking more than two years to acknowledge Russian hackers penetrated some of the state's voter files -- and for remaining mum about which voters were affected.\n\nThe long delay signals to voters in Florida and elsewhere that the government won't level with them if and when their votes are manipulated, the lawmakers say.\n\nAnd that lack of public faith could do just as much damage as the Russian hacking and disinformation operation that upended the 2016 election and cast doubts on the legitimacy of President Trump's victory.\n\n\"This lack of transparency is counterproductive,\" Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D) told me. \"I'm really concerned that it can erode public confidence in the integrity of our elections almost as much as the actual hacking did.\"\n\nThose concerns about election integrity could be especially damaging in Florida, which was the site of a hotly contested recount between George W. Bush and Al Gore in 2000 and is frequently a decisive state in close presidential elections.\n\n\"Florida is the country's largest swing state ... so we can't afford to have the integrity of our democratic process be compromised or have Floridians be concerned about their vote,\" Murphy said.\n\nMurphy and other Florida lawmakers announced plans to introduce legislation to mandate speedy FBI reporting to state and local government officials and to members of Congress about election-related breaches in their districts, as my colleague Karoun Demirjian reported.\n\nThe lawmakers, who also include Reps. Michael Waltz (R) and Matt Gaetz (R), are trying to get as much of the Florida House delegation to co-sponsor the bill as possible along with lawmakers from outside Florida. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) is \"looking into\" sponsoring a Senate version of the bill, a spokesman told me, but didn't provide additional details.\n\nWhile the bill will focus on notifying government officials, Murphy told me, she expects those officials will make the information public as quickly as possible.\n\n\"We have a responsibility to our constituents to make sure we do everything we can to ensure the integrity of their votes,\" she told me.\n\nThe lawmakers' announcement came after a secretive FBI briefing on the breaches that lawmakers say penetrated voter rolls in two Florida counties before the 2016 contest but didn't result in votes being changed.\n\nThe lawmakers were barred from naming the counties where breaches occurred but my colleagues Karoun and Ellen Nakashima reported one of them was Washington County in the Florida Panhandle, with a population of about 25,000 people.\n\nThe public first learned about the breaches from Robert S. Mueller III's report, which revealed that the FBI believed Russian hackers penetrated county-level networks in \"at least one\" Florida county. Gov Ron DeSantis (R) disclosed the hackers penetrated voter files in two counties after his own FBI briefing Tuesday.\n\nThe FBI assured DeSantis that county officials were aware of the breach, he said.\n\nThe federal government has a spotty track record when it comes to telling state and local officials about election security issues.\n\nIt wasn't until September 2017, more than 10 months after the 2016 election, that the Department of Homeland Security officially notified election leaders in 21 states that Russian hackers probed their election networks.\n\nAnd officials in Illinois -- where Russian hackers breached a statewide database and made off with the personal data of tens of thousands of voters -- didn't get official confirmation about the breach until Mueller's team indicted those hackers in July 2018.\n\nDHS has been working hard to improve communication since 2017, including by creating a dedicated \"information sharing and analysis center\" for election infrastructure and granting more full and temporary security clearances to state election officials.\n\nBut even those efforts have focused mostly on sharing information with government officials rather than the public. That's not sufficient for the Florida lawmakers, Murphy told me.\n\n\"Just like consumers expect credit card companies to disclose when their personal information is breached ... when a voter's data is breached by a foreign actor, they have a right to know that,\" she said.\n\nPINGED: A bill being prepped for introduction this morning by 38 Senate Democrats - including all seven presidential candidates -- would deliver $1 billion to improve the cybersecurity of election systems across the nation plus $175 million in additional state election security grants every two years.\n\nThe Election Security Act, which was introduced in the House on Monday, comes two years after a Russian hacking and disinformation campaign in 2016.\n\nThe bill, which doesn't have any Republican sponsors, is mostly about signaling Democrats' seriousness about election security. Senate Rules Committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) has said he doesn't expect to hold hearings on any election security bills this Congress because he doesn't think Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) will bring them to a floor vote.\n\nThe Election Security Act basically peels the election security provisions from H.R. 1, a catch-all bill of progressive legislation Democrats introduced soon after retaking the House in 2018. It includes a mandate that states use paper ballots or have paper backups and imposes minimum cybersecurity standards on state and local election systems. It also requires voting system to be tested 90 days before an election and a report on election interference threats by U.S. intelligence agencies 180 days before an election.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), a 2020 presidential candidate and ranking member of the Rules Committee, is spearheading the Senate legislation. Other sponsors include 2020 presidential hopefuls Michael (Bennet (Colo.), Cory Booker (N.J.) Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Kamala Harris (Calif.) Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).\n\nPATCHED: The Election Security Act was just the capper on a week full of cybersecurity action on the Hill.\n\nHere are just a few things that have happened since Wednesday:\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee forwarded the bipartisan Defending Elections against Trolls from Enemy Regimes Act, which would allow the government to deny visas to foreigners who helped undermine a U.S. election -- and deport anyone already in the United States.\n\nKlobuchar and Sen. Chris Coons (D-Conn.) sent a letter to the Election Assistance Commission, which helps states verify the cybersecurity of their election machines, expressing concerns about major shortfalls on the commission's technology staff. The letter asks what the EAC is doing to improve its staff retention and whether the staffing shortfall will force it to miss security deadlines.\n\nA bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House and Senate introduced the Transportation Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act, which would bar states and cities from using federal money to buy rail cars from China over concerns about digital spying and sabotage. That issue was pushed onto lawmakers' radar this year after China's state-owned rail-car manufacturer, China Railway Rolling Stock Corp., expressed interest in a $1 billion contract to supply the next generation of Washington Metro cars.\n\nRep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.) added a provision to a State Department funding bill directing the department to increase cybersecurity cooperation with allies -- especially when it comes to collectively fighting back against nation-state hackers.\n\nPWNED: China shot back at the U.S. government Thursday over its efforts to bar the telecom giant Huawei from U.S. markets and to shut off its supply of U.S. components.\n\nThe latter move -- which came in a Commerce Department notice that Huawei was being added to list of \"entities\" that it believes act contrary to U.S. national interests -- got less attention but probably will have broader long-term consequences because it will restrict Huawei's ability to compete globally.\n\nIndeed, some trade gurus refer to the \"entity list\" as the \"death penalty,\" as my colleagues Damien Paletta, Ellen Nakashima and David J. Lynch reported, because it \"makes it virtually impossible for companies to survive once U.S. firms are discouraged from doing business with them.\"\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang described the move as an \"abuse of export control measures\" and pledged that \"China will take further necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises,\" the Associated Press's Joe McDonald reported.\n\nHuawei said in a statement that the export resrictions are \"in no one's interest,\" \"will do significant economic harm to the American companies with which Huawei does business\" and will \"affect tens of thousands of American jobs.\"\n\nThe Justice Department on Thursday indicted 10 members of a cybercriminal gang that targeted banking information, infected tens of thousands of computers and caused more than $100 million in losses.\n\n\"The primary victims were U.S. businesses and their supporting financial institutions,\" CyberScoop's Sean Lyngaas reported. \"Other organizations hit were a Pennsylvania asphalt and paving business, a Washington law firm, a casino in Gulport, Mississippi, and a California furniture business.\"\n\nThe Justice Department timed the indictment with a related legal action by Europol.\n\n\"The crackdown saw the U.S. partner with Bulgaria, Georgia, Germany, Moldova, and Ukraine, resulting in an indictment being returned by a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh, and prosecution of defendants in Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine,\" Sean reported. \"Five of the accused live in Russia, which does not have an extradition agreement with the U.S.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/dd721d9bdbb806d9fd0d29470d7dbfd7-5472-3648-70-8-AYG6P7TWO4I6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4788016", "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 295789260}, {"uri": "1138077961", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-17", "time": "00:51:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-17T00:51:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/are-the-us-and-china-heading-for-a-deal--or-a-divorce/2019/05/16/ce7e8e14-780c-11e9-bd25-c989555e7766_story.html", "title": "Are the U.S. and China heading for a deal  --  or a divorce?", "body": "By David J. Lynch David J. Lynch Financial writer covering trade and globalization May 16 at 8:05 PM\n\nPresident Trump's latest swipe at China suggests that more than a year of negotiations aimed at a sweeping trade deal with Beijing may instead produce agreement only on the terms of an economic divorce.\n\nThe relationship between the two nations hasn't deteriorated to quite that point -- yet. But on Thursday, tensions ratcheted up again as China vowed to take \"all necessary measures\" in response to the administration's latest action, which placed the Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei Technologies on a U.S. export blacklist.\n\nThe move against one of China's most prominent companies, a politically connected symbol of the Chinese government's aspirations to technology leadership, upended prospects for an early resumption of negotiations and appeared to invite a harsh Chinese response.\n\n[As Trump fights with China over trade, U.S.-China economic relationship is already being redefined]\n\nIt also led some analysts to warn that after four decades of ever tighter economic ties, the Trump administration might seek to decouple the world's two largest economies -- a step that could shake the global economy.\n\n\"The United States could not have taken a more provocative action against China's economy,\" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"This action is potentially devastating not only to Huawei the company but to the networks around the world that run on Huawei equipment. This action certainly now puts the entire economic relationship up on the table.\"\n\nTrump was personally involved in the deliberations over punishing the Chinese company. He arrived late to a Roosevelt Room meeting Wednesday about his immigration plan, saying he had been working on China trade issues. The president acknowledged that China would be unhappy with his Huawei decision, saying it could complicate trade negotiations.\n\nBut he described the decision as unavoidable, repeatedly remarking that China is taking over the world because of its technical prowess.\n\n\"Unless we stand up now, there's not going to be a chance to do it in the future,\" the president said, according to one attendee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a confidential conversation.\n\nWith Trump scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in six weeks at the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, the timing of the strike against Huawei puzzled many observers. \"I was surprised by the timing,\" said Dennis Wilder, a former China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency. \"Is this just Trump giving himself another card to play? Or has he come over to the side of those in the administration who favor decoupling?\"\n\nDerek Scissors, a China expert and occasional administration adviser who has called for the United States to cut ties with China, said the president did not support a full rupture and was simply \"arming himself for Osaka.\"\n\nThe trade talks themselves are on life support. After Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers this week that U.S. officials planned to return to Beijing soon for more bargaining, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday he didn't know what the treasury chief meant.\n\n[Under Trump, the U.S. enters a new 'Cold War' with China]\n\nThe United States and China are starting to resemble \"a very, very unhappy divorced couple that has to share the house for financial reasons and engages in constant warfare over who gets to sit on the couch and control the television remote,\" said Henry Farrell, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University.\n\nStill, any attempt to disentangle the two giant trading partners would be daunting.\n\nU.S.-China merchandise trade has nearly tripled since 2004 to a total of $660 billion last year. Cargo moving between the two countries represents roughly one of every six U.S. dollars.\n\nThe interdependence also is financial: China holds more than $1.1 trillion in U.S. Treasurys, making it the largest single foreign holder of the government securities.\n\nAs post-Mao China embarked on economic reforms starting in the late 1970s, U.S. presidents of both parties celebrated the potential gains for American companies and anticipated that Chinese political liberalization would follow.\n\nBut under Xi, China has taken an authoritarian turn, while Trump has emphasized the need to resolve long-standing U.S. complaints about Chinese trade-secret theft and discrimination against foreign companies. Washington also now sees China much more as a strategic adversary than a potential partner, further encouraging advocates of decoupling.\n\nThe Commerce Department action against Huawei capped years of U.S. government unease about the security implications of doing business with the company, the largest telecommunications equipment maker in the world.\n\nBoth the Obama and Trump administrations worried that Huawei could engineer technological back doors in its equipment that would permit Chinese officials to spy on Americans or, in times of conflict, disrupt or paralyze critical U.S. networks.\n\n\"Huawei is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interest,\" the Commerce Department said in announcing that it was adding the company and its affiliates to the \"entity list.\"\n\nAs a result, any company that wants to sell American technology to Huawei must first obtain a government license -- a requirement that threatens to sever the Chinese company's U.S. supply lines.\n\nOn Wall Street, investors broadly took the latest trade-war drama in stride, though companies that supply Huawei took a beating. The Dow Jones industrial average rose almost 215 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 25,862.68.\n\n\"The US-China economic relationship is too important -- and has the potential to generate too much wealth -- to be sacrificed for short-term protectionism,\" Jim Glassman, head economist with JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking, wrote Thursday in a research note. \"Neither side would benefit from disrupting the flow of trade or reversing the integration of the global economy.\"\n\n[Trump takes aim at China's tech sector. That could hurt U.S. innovation.]\n\nThat may or may not be the Trump administration's view. Over the past year, the administration has taken a number of steps to slow or reverse economic integration between the United States and China.\n\nThe screening process for Chinese companies' proposed U.S. investments has gotten tougher. New regulations to limit the export to China of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and robotics are being drafted. And Washington is getting stingy with visas for Chinese academics, students and business people.\n\nTrump's serial tariff rounds also have U.S. importers paying the highest average duties in more than a quarter century, according to Scotiabank, a Canadian bank.\n\nAdministration officials have adopted an increasingly harsh tone toward China since a landmark October speech at the Hudson Institute by Vice President Pence, warning companies of the dangers of doing business with China, including forced technology transfer, rampant theft of intellectual property and cyberespionage.\n\n\"China seems determined to steal its way up the economic ladder at our expense. .\u2009.\u2009. The reality is that some of these threats are existential threats to them as a business,\" FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said in April.\n\nEven if the trade talks produce a meaningful accord, both countries are likely to take divergent paths in areas including the development of advanced technology.\n\nTrump's advisers from the outset have been split over the goal and extent of the trade rebalancing with China. Mnuchin is among those seeking to preserve lucrative trade and investment ties. Others such as Peter Navarro, director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, want to return lost factories to American soil.\n\n\"It just seems like a total misunderstanding of reality,\" said Carlos Gutierrez, chairman of Albright Stonebridge Group and commerce secretary in the George W. Bush administration. \"So much of what happens here starts in China. .\u2009.\u2009. It is unrealistic to assume that we can take all those supply chains that we built over there and somehow separate ourselves from China.\"\n\nU.S. efforts to limit China's global economic role already have stumbled. Despite high-profile warnings about Huawei, the United Kingdom and Germany refused to exclude the company from supplying their 5G networks.\n\nLikewise, Italy, another U.S. ally, brushed aside Washington's objections and joined Xi's signature global infrastructure program, the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\n\"China is not decoupling itself from the world. If anything, China is tying itself to the world even more,\" said Gutierrez. \"At a time when there are people whispering in the president's ear that we can decouple ourselves, it seems like strategic suicide.\"\n\nJosh Dawsey contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oEnQNzEg9gjPVnp6JBis81n83BE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5CUHQKDX5AI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4786358", "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 295750260}, {"uri": "1137958134", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-16", "time": "22:36:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-16T22:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/16/trumps-huawei-sanctions-underscore-us-dependency-china-tech/", "title": "Trump's Huawei sanctions underscore U.S. dependency on China tech", "body": "Telecommunications firm says it spends more than $1 out of every $7 buying components from U.S. firms.\n\n(Thomas Peter/Reuters) By Greg Bensinger and Greg Bensinger Reporter covering algorithms and artificial intelligence Reed Albergotti Reed Albergotti Reporter covering consumer electronics May 16 at 6:20 PM\n\nU.S. suppliers to China-based Huawei would be affected quickly if a ban on exporting hardware and services proposed by the U.S. Commerce Department Wednesday goes into effect.\n\nThe telecommunications company said Thursday it spends more than $1 out of every $7 of its annual $70 billion procurement budget buying components from U.S. firms. Huawei is dependent on U.S. suppliers for components including wireless chips, antennas and handset operating software, meaning the ban could also cripple its ability to continue producing the latest equipment.\n\nHuawei immediately pushed back against the directive, which has not yet taken effect, saying it threatens U.S. jobs.\n\n\"This decision is in no one's interest,\" said spokesman Chasen Skinner in an email. \"It will do significant economic harm to the American companies with which Huawei does business, affect tens of thousands of jobs, and disrupt the current collaboration and mutual trust that exist on the global supply chain.\" He didn't respond to a request for further comment.\n\n[Trump administration cracks down on giant Chinese tech firm, escalating clash with Beijing]\n\nHighlighting the risk to American companies, investors punished several Huawei suppliers Thursday by selling off shares. Little-known network gear manufacturer NeoPhotonics' stock price closed down 20 percent, while semiconductor firm Qorvo was off 7.1 percent. Qualcomm fell 4 percent.\n\nThose stock prices fell following the Trump administration's decision Wednesday to add Huawei and about 70 affiliates to its so-called \"Entity List,\" which precludes the company from acquiring equipment from U.S. firms without government approval. It's the latest broadside to the Shenzen-based company, which U.S. officials have said represents a security threat because of its ties to the Chinese government. Huawei has denied those allegations.\n\nThe company has been in U.S. crosshairs for years over claims it could use its network equipment to spy on foreign nations, prompting network providers AT&T and Verizon to ban the sale of their handsets. In its statement Thursday, Huawei said it would \"seek remedies immediately\" and \"endeavor to mitigate the impacts of this incident.\"\n\nSuch trade bans can be crippling. Trump last year restricted ZTE, another Chinese telecommunications company, from doing business with American firms over violating U.S. sanctions with Iran and North Korea. That effectively prevented the firm from manufacturing new equipment. The administration ultimately lifted its limits on ZTE, which agreed to pay a fine and restructure its management.\n\n[Trump says he'll spare Chinese telecom firm ZTE from collapse, defying lawmakers]\n\nRepresentatives for U.S. suppliers, who did not want to be identified, said they were unsure about the lasting impact of the Huawei ban on their operations.\n\nThose companies and potentially dozens of others would have to apply to the government for special consideration to continue supplying Huawei, said Center for Strategic and International Studies adviser William Reinsch, a former Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"That doesn't mean every license would be denied, but it would be on a case-by-case basis,\" he said. \"It also gives the government an intelligence bonanza\" in the form of a list of every U.S. supplier to Huawei.\n\nForeign companies who rely on U.S. firms for 25% or more of their components would also likely be subject to the disclosure requirements, said Reinsch.\n\nCustomers using Huawei's mobile handsets could also face disruptions in their operating software, said industry observers. The company relies on Google's Android software and licenses certain Google apps, like those for mapping, in its markets outside of China, said Chetan Sharma, a wireless industry consultant.\n\nHuawei may not be able to get updates to those apps, or allow customers to access the Play app store, if Google is not granted a reprieve from the Commerce Department order, said Sharma. \"It would start to impact new handset sales very quickly,\" he said. \"Huawei would essentially be a sitting duck.\"\n\nIn-app purchases could be rendered impossible if transactions routed through Google's servers aren't permitted.\n\nGoogle spokesman Colin Smith said he didn't have an immediate comment.\n\nAttempts by other firms to create a third operating system to compete with Android's or Apple's iOS have largely fallen flat in the western world, meaning Huawei would have few options to make its mobile phones relevant to customers.\n\nThere was broad confusion, though, on exactly how the restrictions on Huawei might work. One supplier representative, who asked not to be named, said for example that U.S. chips made in Taiwan could still be sold to Huawei, even though they were designed by U.S. companies. That would spell good news for U.S. chip makers that supply Huawei. It would also be a relief to Huawei, because chip design is one of area where Chinese companies still lag behind the U.S.\n\nNelson Dong, a partner at law firm Dorsey and Whitney LLP, disagreed with that assessment. A chip designed mostly within the U.S. would make it a U.S. product, even if the chip itself was manufactured elsewhere. \"It's a product made from U.S. technology,\" he said, and therefore would be prohibited to companies on the entity list. Even so, he said, some companies decline to sell to customers who are on the restricted list, even if the sale could be defended legally.\n\nMost U.S. technology companies have compliance departments that maintain lists of customers restricted by U.S. export sales. Before selling technology products, it's common to run the customer through a database to ensure the sale doesn't violate any U.S. restrictions. As of Thursday, Huawei had not officially been added to the list of restricted companies. Companies may have already started scaling back production in anticipation, experts said.\n\nThe Chinese company and its top executive are also being prosecuted for allegedly violating the U.S. sanctions on Iran and for stealing trade secrets from competitors and partners. The ban on exports to Huawei could be used as leverage in settlement talks over Huawei's criminal case, the supplier representatives said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xQE93993rhnWfPjyUYl6LM8phRQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MOZ6Z5DX4UI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4786358", "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 295742160}, {"uri": "1137889609", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2019-05-16", "time": "20:28:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-16T20:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/05/16/business/16reuters-usa-trade-china.html", "title": "Huawei Ban Clouds U.S.-China Trade Talks, Tech Sector", "body": "WASHINGTON/BEIJING -- A U.S. bid to block China's Huawei Technologies from buying vital American technology threw into question sales from some of the largest tech companies and drew a sharp rebuke on Thursday from Beijing, which warned it could hurt trade talks.\n\nShares of Huawei's U.S. suppliers fell on fears the Chinese firm would be forced to stop buying American chips, software and other components after the Trump administration banned it from buying U.S. technology without special approval.\n\nHuawei, the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker, said that losing access to U.S. suppliers \"will do significant economic harm to the American companies\" and affect \"tens of thousands of American jobs.\"\n\n\"Huawei will seek remedies immediately and find a resolution to this matter,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Bloomberg the order blacklisting Huawei will go into effect on Friday.\n\nThe U.S. crackdown, announced on Wednesday, was the latest shot fired in a U.S.-China trade war that is rattling financial markets and threatening to derail a slowing global economy.\n\nChinese officials said Washington's aggressive posture could affect trade talks, which appeared to have hit an impasse in the past week as the United States hiked tariffs on Chinese goods and Beijing retaliated with higher duties on U.S. products.\n\nCommerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng stressed that the United States should avoid further damaging Sino-U.S. trade relations. \"China will take all the necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese firms,\" Gao told reporters.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry also announced the formal arrest of two Canadian citizens who were detained shortly after Canada arrested Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in December.\n\nMeng faces extradition to the United States on charges that she conspired to defraud global banks about Huawei's relationship with a company operating in Iran. She and the company deny the charges.\n\nWhile Canada says China has made no specific link between the detentions of the two men and Meng's arrest, experts and former diplomats say they have no doubt it is using their cases to pressure Canada.\n\nECONOMIC FALLOUT\n\nThe Commerce Department said on Wednesday it was adding Huawei and affiliates to its \"Entity List,\" which bars them from buying components and technology from U.S. firms without government approval.\n\nLawmakers in the U.S. Congress have long feared that Huawei's equipment could be used by the Chinese government to spy on Americans. Democrats and Republicans lined up in support of the Trump administration's move.\n\nRepublican Senator Marco Rubio said firms should reconsider entering into long-term contracts with Huawei, noting in a tweet that \"very soon Huawei will lose access to important components like chips, antennae & phone operating systems.\"\n\nRubio added that for Huawei there are \"real questions now about how they can survive this.\"\n\nLeading analysts downgraded their assessments for several microchip companies in the wake of the move against Huawei, which was the world's third largest purchaser of semiconductors last year.\n\nHuawei was the world's third largest purchaser of semiconductors last year, accounting for 4.4% of global market share and behind only Samsung Electronics and Apple, according to Gartner, a research firm.\n\nSusquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said he believed Huawei had built up a one- to two-year supply of U.S. components, noting that \"this is what Huawei was afraid of!\" Rolland cut price targets on several microchip companies, including Xilinx Inc.\n\nShares of Xilinx were down 5.7 percent in the early afternoon on Thursday while those of rival chipmaker Qualcomm Inc fell 3.6 percent. They were the biggest drags on the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index.\n\nOptical components maker NeoPhotonics Corp was the biggest loser, with its shares falling 16.3%.\n\nAnalog Devices and Finisar Corp was down about 2.5% while Skyworks Solutions shed 4.8%, Qorvo was down 5.9%, laser sensor maker Lumentum Holdings fell 9%, and memory chipmaker Micron Technology lost 2.7%.\n\nThere are also growing signs the U.S.-China trade war could filter into the broader economy.\n\nWalmart Inc said prices for shoppers will rise due to higher tariffs on Chinese goods even as the world's largest retailer reported on Thursday its best comparable sales growth for the first quarter in nine years.\n\nWalmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters the company will seek to ease the pain, in part by trying to buy from different countries.\n\nTARIFFS\n\nAs negotiations toward resolving the trade war stalled last week, the United States ramped up the pressure by raising tariffs on a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25% from 10%.\n\nChina, which views the U.S. decision last year to impose tariffs as the genesis of the trade war, retaliated this week with higher duties on a revised list of $60 billion worth of U.S. products.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has embraced protectionism and accused China of engaging in unfair trade practices, has threatened to put 25% tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.\n\nWith few options left for levying tariffs on U.S. goods, China could opt for other ways to pressure the United States, including blocking corporate mergers and other deals.\n\n\"There's other things they can do, and M&A would certainly be one thing,\" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein.\n\nWhile the United States wants significant changes in China's approach to intellectual property rights and state subsidies as part of any trade deal, Beijing is insisting that all tariffs be eliminated.\n\nThe two sides are also at odds over how much more in U.S. goods China would have to agree to buy as well as how balanced the text of the draft trade agreement should be, Vice Premier Liu He, China's lead trade negotiator, said last week.\n\n(Reporting by Yawen Chen and Se Young Lee and Diane Bartz; Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington, Stephen Nellis and Noel Randewich; in San Francisco and Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Writing by Chris Sanders and Paul Simao; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall)", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@nytimes.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 295734480}, {"uri": "1137860921", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-16", "time": "19:39:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-16T19:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/16/basketball-castles-river-boats-look-inside-huaweis-sprawling-europe-inspired-campus-china/", "title": "Basketball, castles and river boats: A look inside Huawei's sprawling, Europe-inspired campus in China", "body": "A Huawei security guard stands outside a gate at the sprawling Ox Horn Research and Development campus on April 24 in Dongguan, near Shenzhen, China.

The campus design drew inspiration from around the world, with 12 sections based on architectural traditions from different countries, including France and Italy. There are even reproductions of major European historical sites, like Versailles.\n\nImages from the expanding campus, taken by Getty photographer Kevin Frayer last month, capture a glimpse into life for Huawei's employees in the wake of renewed controversy over the tech company in recent months.\n\nHuawei workers leave at the end of the workday at the new sprawling Ox Horn Research and Development campus.

This week, the Trump administration penalized Huawei by adding the company to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security's \"Entity List.\" As The Washington Post reported, some call the list the \"death penalty\" because of how hard it makes it for companies to prosper once U.S. firms are discouraged from working with them. The move came after Washington and Beijing failed to reach agreements in trade talks.\n\nHours later, on Thursday, China's Foreign Ministry said two detained Canadians were officially arrested on charges of espionage. The two men have been held in Chinese detention since December, and were detained shortly after Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in a Canadian airport on a U.S. request, amid accusations she violated U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\nBelow are some snapshots from inside Ox Horn, from desk naps and ping-pong to boating on the sprawling grounds' river ways and selfies in front of its reproductions of famous landmarks.\n\nA member of Huawei's reception staff stands behind the desk at the Cyber Security Lab.

It has all but snuffed out the Chinese tech giant's sales in the United States, calling the firm an espionage threat. And it has tried to convince other governments to do similarly.\n\nBut Washington had not taken a straight shot at Huawei's ability to do business anywhere in the world until late Wednesday, when the Commerce Department announced restrictions on the company's access to American technology.\n\nAmerican companies including Qualcomm, Intel and Broadcom sell Huawei microchips and other specialized parts that go into its smartphones and telecom equipment. Google's Android software powers its phones. Of the $70 billion that Huawei spent on components and other supplies last year, $11 billion went to American companies, a Huawei spokesman, Joe Kelly, said.\n\nIf Huawei is cut off from these suppliers, the effect could be catastrophic for the millions of people who use Huawei smartphones -- and for the mobile networks, across a wide swath of the planet, that run on Huawei gear.\n\nIt would be \"the trade equivalent of a nuclear bomb,\" said Kevin J. Wolf, a partner at the law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and a former assistant secretary of commerce under President Barack Obama.\n\nMuch remains unclear, however, about the scope and potential impact of the Commerce Department's move. The department says it is putting Huawei on its \"entity list\" of firms that need special permission to buy American components and technology. How it decides to grant such permissions, and how broad a range of products the policy covers, will determine how badly Huawei's business is disrupted.\n\nGiven the spiraling tensions between China and the United States on tariffs, the move against Huawei may also be short-lived. Talks to resolve the trade fight have stalled, and both sides are digging in their heels. The pressure is on to find common ground ahead of a potential meeting next month between President Trump and China's top leader, Xi Jinping, in Japan. Washington's campaign against Huawei could become a bargaining chip.\n\n\"In every other administration, the entity listing was purely a tool of law enforcement and national security,\" Mr. Wolf said. \"The thing to watch is whether this will become a tool of trade policy and used as leverage in the negotiations.\"\n\nHuawei did not have immediate comment about the Commerce Department's move. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Commerce condemned it in regularly scheduled news briefings on Thursday.\n\n\"We urge the United States to stop these wrongful practices and to create favorable conditions for normal cooperation between the two nations' companies,\" said Gao Feng, a spokesman for China's Commerce Ministry.\n\nTensions between the Trump administration and Huawei escalated after American officials arranged the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the company's chief financial officer and a daughter of its founder, in Canada late last year. The company and Ms. Meng face criminal charges in the United States in connection with alleged theft of industrial secrets and violations of sanctions against Iran. Ms. Meng remains in Canada while officials there decide whether she will be extradited.\n\nWashington's action this week against Huawei puts the company in the same position that ZTE, a much smaller Chinese rival in telecom equipment, found itself in a few years ago.\n\nThe Commerce Department added ZTE to the entity list in 2016 after determining that it had violated United States sanctions by selling American-made goods to Iran. Eventually, the department relented, and ZTE agreed to a hefty fine. But a year later, the Commerce Department said ZTE had failed to comply with the terms of the agreement, and American technology companies were barred outright from selling to the company.\n\nCut off from American microchips and other parts, ZTE halted production and was near collapse until President Trump intervened and softened the punishment to appease the Chinese leadership.\n\nThe episode galvanized China's government and business community. It revealed the extent to which the country's growing technological prowess had been built on American know-how, and how important it was for China to innovate on its own if its economy was to thrive.\n\nHuawei also got a stark demonstration of the power Washington wielded over it.\n\nThe company has since stockpiled components \"for uncertain times,\" Guo Ping, a Huawei deputy chairman, told reporters in March. The firm has also worked to build up a geographically diverse network of suppliers, Mr. Guo said.\n\n\"Huawei has made sustained and deep investments over the past 30 years, and I believe that has been of great help to Huawei's global supply,\" he said.\n\nIn particular, the company has invested for many years in producing its own microchips, a key area in which most Chinese firms are laggards. Sravan Kundojjala, an analyst based in Hyderabad, India, with the technology research firm Strategy Analytics, estimates that three-quarters of the smartphones that Huawei ships today contain chips developed in-house.\n\nMr. Kundojjala acknowledges that he was skeptical when Huawei's semiconductor unit, HiSilicon, began building its own high-end smartphone chips.\n\n\"Initially, I thought this was not going to work out,\" he said. \"It's maybe a pet project. Maybe they just want to play games with their suppliers.\"\n\nInstead, HiSilicon has become a formidable asset for Huawei, with chip technology that analysts say rivals that of market leaders such as Qualcomm.\n\nYet Huawei still depends on American suppliers for enough critical components that an all-out export ban from Washington would create a sizable headache, even if it does not lead to near-ruin as it did for ZTE.\n\n\"When you've got something as complicated as router or a cellphone, even if there's one part you're not able to get, you can't deliver, because you don't have that widget to make the cellphone or router function,\" Mr. Wolf, the lawyer, said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "raymond_zhong@nytimes.com", "name": "Raymond Zhong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/16/business/16HUAWEI/16HUAWEI-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4786358", "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 295710240}, {"uri": "1137556826", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-16", "time": "12:55:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-16T12:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4313725531101227, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-technology-202/2019/05/16/the-technology-202-a-researcher-is-still-surfacing-videos-of-the-christchurch-attacks-on-facebook-and-instagram-two-months-later/5cdcc65da7a0a435cff8c07f/", "title": "Analysis | The Technology 202: A researcher is still surfacing videos of the Christchurch attacks on Facebook and Instagram two months later", "body": "A researcher is still spotting videos of the Christchurch shootings on Facebook and Instagram -- two months after the New Zealand attacks that killed 51 and spurred technology companies and governments to pledge more vigilance about the spread of hate online.\n\nAs of yesterday, there were at least two videos of the shootings available on Instagram and two videos available on Facebook, according to Eric Feinberg, a researcher and chief executive of GiPEC, a cyber\u00adintelligence start-up that tracks harmful activity on tech platforms. Facebook removed all four videos yesterday afternoon after the Technology 202 reviewed them and reached out to the social network for comment.\n\nFeinberg says he detected the videos by hunting for obvious hashtags -- searching for the terms such as \"New Zealand mosque attack\" in various languages, including Arabic. (He used similar techniques to identify posts about drugs on social media). Feinberg says if he can find these posts independently, it casts skepticism on the efficacy of Facebook's recent investments to improve its ability to moderate violent content on its platform.\n\n\"I think it's just appalling,\" Feinberg said. \"They've been on notice that these exist.\"\n\n\"You would think that with the 30,000 moderators they have that they would put a full court press on this,\" he added. The teams working on safety and security at Facebook are now more than 30,000, and about half this team are content reviewers -- a mix of full-time employees, contractors and companies.\n\nFacebook has struggled to keep up with the deluge of Christchurch shooting videos that were posted to its website after the alleged gunman used Facebook Live to broadcast the shooting in real time. Even after that video was removed, copies were already saved, and posted across a wide range of social media services, including YouTube and1.5 Twitter. Facebook says it continues to try to stamp out videos of the shooting -- but it hasn't shared data about how many of those videos it's still blocking or removing since it said it removed 1.5 million videos in the first 24 hours after the attack.\n\n\"We continue to automatically detect and prevent new uploads of this content on our platforms, using a database of more than 900 visually unique versions of this video,\" Facebook spokeswoman Sally Aldous said. \"When we identify isolated instances of newly edited versions of the video being uploaded, we take it down and add it to our database to prevent future uploads of the same version being shared.\"\n\nFacebook added the videos the Technology 202 flagged to its database so that future uploads will be prevented.\n\nOne of the major challenges for Facebook has been a proliferation of many different variants of the video, which people edited. Facebook deployed a number of techniques to find these variants, but says it is investing $7.5 million in new research projects to allow it to detect manipulated media and better distinguish between unwitting posters and intentional adversaries. The company also introduced new restrictions on Facebook Live to try to prevent other violent events from being live broadcast in the future.\n\nGoogle and Twitter have also struggled to police the proliferation of the video. Feinberg said he did not find any copies of the video still available on these platforms in recent days.\n\nFacebook announced these changes as it joined several other companies and foreign governments in signing the Christchurch Call yesterday -- a global pledge to stamp out violent extremism online. Companies including Amazon, Google, Twitter and Microsoft, promised to work more closedly with each other and governments to prevent their sites from fostering terrorism.\n\nThe pledge is largely symbolic because the document is non-binding. The White House did not sign onto the pledge after Trump administration officials said free-speech concerns prevented them from formally approving it.\n\nFeinberg says \"there's no teeth\" in the pledge, and he believes it's time for Congress to overhaul Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a legal provision that gives the technology platforms broad immunity for the content that third parties post on their sites.\n\n\"It's not for the White House to comment, it's for Congress to legislate Section 230,\" he said.\n\nThere's growing support in Congress for an overhaul to the law in the wake of the New Zealand attacks. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said on a recent podcast that the provision's future \"could be a question mark and in jeopardy.\"\n\nBITS: The Trump administration stepped up its war with Facebook, Google and Twitter yesterday as it called on Internet users to fill out a form if they feel they'e been censored by the tech giants, my colleague Tony Romm reports. The unprecedented ask follows President Trump's long-running complaints that these services are biased against conservatives.\n\nThe White House says the effort is directed at users \"no matter your views.\" On Twitter, the White House shared an online survey, which asks people to submit their name, contact information and other details. The form asks people to detail problems with censorship on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.\n\nThe tool in which users can complain can be found here.\n\nThe White House also asked those filling out the form whether they wanted email newsletters about \"President Trump's fight for free speech,\" so the administration \"can update you without relying on platforms like Facebook and Twitter.\" Tony notes in his story that President Trump is a prolific tweeter, often blasting his thoughts to his more than 60 million followers.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on how it plans to use the data and whether it intends to try and regulate the companies.\n\n\"The White House wants to hear from all Americans -- regardless of their political leanings -- if they have been impacted by bias on social media platforms,\" spokesman Judd Deere told Tony in a statement.\n\nThe companies have repeatedly denied they censor content on their platforms due to political motives.\n\nTech industry observers were very skeptical of the administration's announcement. Kevin Roose of the New York Times noted the tool may be a means for the White House to build a contact list:\n\nBuzzFeed's Ryan Mac said:\n\nPeople also pointed out the many technical shortcomings of the tool. Daily Dot politics editor David Covucci noted the survey had a unique test for whether respondents were robots:\n\nNIBBLES: The Trump administration hit the Chinese tech firm Huawei with an extreme penalty that will limit its ability to do business with U.S. companies, my colleagues Damian Paletta, Ellen Nakashima and David J. Lynch report.\n\nThe Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security said it is adding Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. to its \"Entity List,\" which my colleagues note is known to some as the \"death penalty.\" The Commerce Department said it added the company to the list because Huawei \"is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interest.\"\n\nThe telecommunications giant with significant backing from the Chinese government has been in regulators' crosshairs. The Justice Department has accused the company of violating Iran sanctions, among other things.\n\n\"President Trump has directed the Commerce Department to be vigilant in its protection of national security activities,\" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.\n\nThe move came right after Trump signed an executive order that expands the government's ability to protect communciations networks.

The CAC 40 in France was 0.4% higher at 5,397. U.S. stocks were also poised to open modestly higher, with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures up 0.3%.\n\nStocks have been volatile all week amid conflicting signals over the U.S.'s trade position. Some comments from the Trump administration have been positive for stocks, while others have shaken markets.\n\nOn Thursday, China protested the Trump administration's decision to issue an executive order apparently aimed at banning equipment sold by telecoms gear maker Huawei from U.S. networks. It also subjected the Chinese company to strict controls on U.S. exports.\n\nHuawei, the biggest global maker of switching equipment for phone and internet companies, has spent a decade fighting accusations it facilitates Chinese spying.\n\nMarkets have swung wildly in recent weeks as trade tensions between the U.S. and China intensified. The Trump administration more than doubled tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports and spelled out plans to target the $300 billion worth that aren't already facing 25% taxes. The escalation covers everything from sneakers to toasters to billiard balls. The Chinese have retaliated by hiking tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. imports.\n\nIt's not been all bleak, though, with some traders, particularly in Europe, focusing on a potential U.S. decision to postpone tariffs on cars.\n\n\"It is remarkable how the stock markets have managed to hold their own rather well considering everything that's happened, from the escalation of U.S.-China trade war to renewed fears over global growth,\" said Fawad Razaqzada, a technical analyst at FOREX.com.\n\n\"When the market is able to absorb so much negativity, it is usually a sign of strength. So I wouldn't bet against the S&P hitting another record high in the coming days, even if we think the markets are overvalued at current levels.\"\n\nMarkets were bolstered Wednesday by reports that the White House plans to delay a decision about imposing tariffs on autos from Europe and elsewhere by up to six months. A decision was due by Saturday.\n\nCNBC, quoting unnamed sources, said that the administration was close to announcing a postponement of the auto tariffs for up to six months. The administration sees the threat of the auto tariffs as a way to gain leverage over trading partners such as the European Union and Japan in ongoing trade talks.\n\nSentiment was also buoyed by reassurances on trade from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin said he and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer were planning to travel to Beijing for more talks. Details of such negotiations have not been announced by the Chinese side.\n\nEarlier, in Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.6% to finish at 21,062.98.

(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nThe Trump administration took its most aggressive action to date Wednesday to bar Chinese companies from access to Americans' sensitive data and digital systems.\n\nThe president's executive order gave the Commerce Department sweeping authority to ban U.S. information and communications technology companies from doing business with any foreign company it deems a threat to national security, as my colleagues Ellen Nakashima and Josh Dawsey reported.\n\nAnd while the initial target seems to be Huawei -- the Chinese telecom giant that's among just a handful of global providers of next-generation 5G wireless technology -- the administration could swing much more broadly. Indeed, senior administration officials addressing the media declined to speak about Huawei directly and stressed the order could be applied to numerous companies.\n\nThe move comes as officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence community are decrying Chinese hacking as the most nettlesome challenge in cyberspace and as the U.S. government is working with industry on broad plans to block foreign threats to numerous industry sectors. That could include publishing lists of acceptable vendors.\n\nIt also comes as the Trump administration is engaged in a tit-for-tat trade dispute with China with both countries raising tariffs on the other's goods. Moves to restrict Chinese companies on national security grounds are sure to push a grand bargain on trade even further away.\n\nThe executive order was expected over a year ago, but it was blocked by the National Economic Council while trade negotiations were ongoing, Ellen and Josh reported. When those talks hit an impasse last week, the council dropped its objections, an official told them.\n\nThe Commerce Department also, on Wednesday, added Huawei and 70 of its affiliates to a list that requires government approval before it can buy components from U.S. companies, a move that will make it highly difficult for Huawei to sell some products, Reuters reported.\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, touted the executive order as a national security necessity with no mention of trade.\n\n\"The President has made it clear that this administration will do what it takes to keep America safe and prosperous, and to protect America from foreign adversaries who are actively and increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology infrastructure and services in the United States,\" press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.\n\nThe order -- which will take effect within 150 days -- may also help the administration's rocky efforts to encourage allies to bar Huawei from their nascent 5G networks, Ellen and Josh reported, but it will be an uphill climb.\n\nAdministration officials have been crossing the globe in recent months urging allies to block Huawei and even threatening to withhold some intelligence sharing if the Chinese company wins those nations' 5G contracts.\n\nThose pleas have had limited success in Europe, however, and even Canada appears poised to go its own way on Huawei.\n\nThe U.S. government's general position is that the Chinese government could force Huawei to steal secrets from U.S. companies or government agencies or to sabotage them during a broader conflict -- even if the company didn't want to.\n\nThe danger of sabotage will grow substantially with 5G, they say, because the super-fast networks will enable far more things to be connected to wireless Internet -- including advanced medical technology and driverless cars -- that could cause severe damage or even deaths if they were corrupted.\n\n\"This moves from a data confidentiality issue to a life-safety issue,\" Chris Krebs, director of the DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told senators during a Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday.\n\nHuawei officials, meanwhile, say they've never assisted Chinese spying and would refuse any request to do so -- from any nation.\n\nHuawei Chief Security Officer Andy Purdy told me on Tuesday -- before the executive order was issued -- the U.S. government's concerns can be addressed by rigorous testing. Purdy, who was a top DHS cybersecurity official during the George W. Bush administration, added that all telecoms offering 5G technology should undergo similar testing because even accidental vulnerabilities can be exploited by a nation's adversaries.\n\n\"We'd welcome the opportunity to talk to these folks, to talk about policy and to help them understand the nature of the risks,\" he said.\n\nPINGED: The Senate is unlikely to vote on any election security bills this Congress despite intelligence agencies' warnings that Russian hackers will probably try to undermine the 2020 election as they did in 2016, Senate Rules Committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said Wednesday.\n\nBlunt made the comments during a Rules Committee hearing, saying there's no point in his committee considering election security bills because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) won't allow a floor vote on them. That was in response to a question from Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).\n\nPolitico's Eric Geller recounted the exchange on Twitter:\n\nH.R. 1 was a catch-all Democratic House bill that mandated election security reforms as well as increased voter access and other progressive priorities.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) introduced an election security bill popular with Democrats this week that would mandate paper ballots, post-election audits and minimum cybersecurity standards for state and local election systems. A bipartisan election security bill with fewer mandates sponsored by Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) is expected later this month.\n\nPATCHED: The FBI has offered to brief 2020 presidential candidates on counterintelligence threats after a Russian hacking and disinformation campaign that aimed to undermine the 2016 contest, CNN's Donnie O'Sullivan, Evan Perez and Kevin Collier reported.\n\n\"The Democratic National Committee has also scheduled a separate briefing, developed with the help of a former intelligence officer, for this week with Democratic presidential campaigns to provide basic counterintelligence training\" and is \"encouraging campaigns to work with FBI field offices,\" CNN reported.\n\nThe FBI has also briefed the Republican National Committee and plans to brief the Trump campaign, according to the report.\n\nPWNED: Lawmakers want the State Department to check the spread of hacking tools and know-how from the United States to other nations, Reuters's Christopher Bing and Joel Schechtman reported.\n\nThe move comes after a Reuters report about former hackers for U.S. intelligence agencies who took contract jobs hacking on behalf of the United Arab Emirates -- and helped the gulf nation spy on a BBC host and the chairman of Al Jazeera among other targets.\n\nThe State Department granted permission for a Maryland-based company to offer those hackers' services to the UAE, but it's not clear how much the department actually knew about the operations, Reuters reported.\n\nA House Appropriations subcommittee on Wednesday forwarded legislation that \"would direct the State Department to report to Congress how it decides whether to approve the sale of cyber capabilities abroad and to disclose any action it has taken to punish companies for violating its policies in the past year,\" Chris and Joel reported.\n\nThe measure was added to a spending bill by Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.) who told Reuters he was \"particularly troubled by recent media reports\" about the State Department's process for approving the sale of cyberweapons and services.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/9ce919c0d77e72e5ff7475dac4cbd3fa-5472-3648-70-8-A5MTCHDXNUI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4786358", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 295702440}, {"uri": "1137490295", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-16", "time": "11:34:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-16T11:34:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5411764979362488, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-finance-202/2019/05/16/the-finance-202-trump-dashes-hopes-of-trade-peace-with-china-europe-and-japan/5cdc62a9a7a0a47fd45a4dbe/", "title": "Analysis | The Finance 202: Trump dashes hopes of trade peace with China, Europe and Japan", "body": "A few shafts of light seemed to pierce the gathering gloom of President Trump's trade offensive on Wednesday.\n\nOn several critical fronts, the administration looked to be ratcheting back tensions. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump's trade team probably would return to Beijing soon to continue negotiations. He said negotiators are also close to reaching a deal with Canada and Mexico that would lift steel and aluminum tariffs the administration imposed a year ago. And the president, several outlets reported, would delay for six months a decision on imposing import duties on foreign cars and parts, avoiding a move the auto industry has said would be crippling.\n\nInvestors took the developments as a sign that trade peace is primed to break out: Stocks rallied for the second day in a row.\n\nBut developments later in the day should dash that nascent optimism -- and provide a warning to anyone inclined to conclude the Trump administration wants to wind down its trade fights any time soon.\n\nTrump on Wednesday evening declared a national emergency, via an executive order, to protect American communications networks from espionage by foreign suppliers, a move directed at Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Then the Commerce Department effectively banned the sale of American tech to the company, my colleagues Ellen Nakashima and Josh Dawsey report.\n\nAnd rather than declare a temporary cease-fire on autos, Trump will give the European Union and Japan six months to agree to limit their imports into the United States, Bloomberg News's Jenny Leonard and Shawn Donnan report. \"According to the order, which people familiar with the matter say Trump is expected to sign this week, the administration has determined that imports of cars into the U.S. present a threat to national security because they have hurt domestic producers and their ability to invest in new technologies,\" they write.\n\nThe lesson for investors, business owners and everyone else with a stake in the outcome of the trade wars is clear enough: Although Trump may be focused for now on dialing up his confrontation with Beijing, he is still intent on forcing a reckoning with Europe and Japan.\n\nClose observers of Trump's handling of his trade agenda say his get-tough approach to erstwhile allies and strategic competitors alike should come as no surprise. \"Trump loves leverage. So he sees the auto tariffs as a leverage point with the E.U. and also with Japan, primarily for agriculture because the E.U. is refusing to include agriculture in the negotiations,\" says Stephen Myrow, managing partner of policy research firm Beacon Policy Advisors. \"The protectionism angle is going to be with us indefinitely as long as he's in office.\"\n\nIn a note this week, Chris Krueger of Cowen Research Group reached the same conclusion about Trump's attitude toward auto tariffs. \"There is a strong belief in the Administration that the only reason USMCA was signed and that the Chinese are negotiating is because tariffs were not only threatened, but imposed,\" he writes. \"The general idea is in order for Japan and EU negotiators to open up agricultural markets to U.S. farmers, auto (and auto parts) tariffs will be required.\"\n\nAnd even before Trump's executive order on autos, industry sources responded tepidly to the news of the tariff postponement. \"Manufactures and suppliers do best when there's certainty in the economic environment. And these continued negotiations, with the cloud of not having agreement on what we're negotiating, just extends the uncertainty,\" said Anne Wilson, a top lobbyist for the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association. \"This will lead to loss of jobs and loss of investment in the U.S.\"\n\nOr as the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers put it in a Wednesday statement, \"The case remains clear -- cars are not a national security threat. We are deeply concerned that the administration continues to consider imposing auto tariffs.\"\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\n-- Hope for USMCA: \"[Trump's] flailing domestic agenda received a spark of life on Wednesday, with top lawmakers in both parties expressing new hope that the president's North American trade pact could be ratified by Congress this year,\" Politico's Heather Caygle, Burgess Everett and Sabrina Rodriguez report. \"Key officials negotiating the deal with Mexico and Canada are working both sides of the Capitol in an effort to ease concerns not only over the provisions of the pact but Trump's ongoing tariff war with Mexico, Canada, Europe and China.\"\n\n-- Xi speaks, brushes back critiques of Chinese culture. Chinese President Xi Jinping repeated his rallying cry about his nation's culture on Wednesday, continuing his call \"on Asian countries to stand together with self-confidence and promote their culture as the world becomes 'multipolar,' my colleague Gerry Shih reports from Beijing. \"Wednesday's conference came weeks after a top State Department official drew heavy criticism from within U.S. policy circles and from China for remarks casting U.S. competition with China as a cultural and racial clash.\"\n\n-- Alibaba reports slower growth. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba \"appears to be feeling the effects of China's economic slowdown and the trade war with the United States,\" the New York Times's Raymond Zhong reports. \"[Alibaba] Group said on Wednesday that revenue increased by 51 percent in the March quarter from the same period last year. That topped Wall Street's expectations, and was a pickup from the quarter before. But it was still the company's second-slowest pace of revenue expansion since early 2016.\"\n\n\"Alibaba's enormous size makes the company a closely watched bellwether for consumer and business sentiment in China, even if it's an obstacle to finding new ways to make money.\"\n\n-- North Carolina sues Juul: \"North Carolina Attorney General Joshua Stein filed a lawsuit Wednesday against popular e-cigarette maker Juul Labs, making it the first state to take legal action against the company,\" my colleague Deanna Paul reports. \"The suit, filed in state court, alleges that Juul caused addiction in consumers by \"deceptively downplaying the potency and danger of the nicotine\" and employed advertising campaigns that targeted people under the legal smoking age.\"\n\n-- The Met turns down Sackler money: \"The Metropolitan Museum of Art said on Wednesday that it would stop accepting gifts from members of the Sackler family linked to OxyContin, severing ties between one of the world's most prestigious museums and one of its most prolific philanthropic dynasties,\" the Times's Elizabeth A. Harris reports.\n\n\"The decision was months in the making, and followed steps by other museums, including the Tate Modern in London and the Solomon R.

Bush's National Economic Council director [Larry Lindsey], spoke Tuesday separately to both the elected House GOP leadership and top committee Republicans, and his presentation about China and trade turned a lot of heads, according to multiple people who were in both meetings,\" Politico's Anna Palmer, Jake Sherman, Daniel Lippman, Eli Okun and Garrett Ross report. \"China views [Trump] as a 'total narcissist' -- 'a 10-out-of-10 narcissist,' he said. Lindsey attributed this to the president's upbringing and said his mother didn't pay him adequate attention in childhood.\"\n\n\"[Lindsey] said Trump has no long-term plans or ability to think ahead. He said the president has the long-term decision-making ability of an 'empty chair.' \"\n\nMy colleague Josh Dawsey reports this nugget on the Trump-Lindsey nexus:\n\n-- Warren slams Treasury official over Wells Fargo. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has lashed out at Wells Fargo for more than two years. On Wednesday, she \"turned her ire on one of the San Francisco bank's main regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which provides day-to-day oversight of large national banks,\" my colleague Renae Merle reports. \"Wells Fargo is conducting a nationwide search for a new chief executive -- its third in three years -- and Warren wanted to know whether the OCC would exercise its 'veto' power over the bank's choice. It would, agency head Joseph Otting told Warren during a Senate Banking Committee hearing.\"\n\n\"Things went awry when Warren asked Otting to share the results of the OCC's review of Wells Fargo chief executive candidates. Otting declined, saying it would be confidential and his 'prerogative\" to keep it that way.' \"\n\nThen came the key exchange: \"Warren told Otting that the OCC had repeatedly 'ducked' its oversight responsibilities,\" Renae writes.\n\n-- Mnuchin says Trump tax fight will be settled in court. \"Mnuchin testified before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that he and his department had not yet made a formal decision on whether to comply with the subpoenas for six years of Trump's tax returns,\" CNBC's Kevin Breuninger reports. \"But he added that lawmakers can probably 'guess which way we're leaning.'\"\n\n-- Phil Swagel to head CBO.

Chinese officials were alarmed and outraged in 2016 when the Commerce Department similarly put ZTE on the \"Entity List,\" which threatened to put that Chinese tech giant out of business practically overnight.\n\nLu on Thursday slammed the Trump administration's \"unilateral sanctions\" as an abuse of export control measures and said China would take steps to defend itself.\n\n\"When Chinese businesses are wrongfully treated, China has the right to take measures to safeguard our legitimate and lawful rights and interests,\" he said.\n\nCanada became entangled in the brewing U.S.-China showdown late last year.\n\nSpavor, a businessman based near the China-North Korea border, and Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat and geopolitics researcher, were first detained by Chinese state security on Dec. 10, a week after Canadian airport authorities detained senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at the behest of U.S. law enforcement.\n\nThe Huawei chief financial officer has since been undergoing extradition proceedings in Canadian court, which is deciding whether to send her to the United States to face bank fraud charges. China has urged Canadian authorities to release Meng and repeatedly issued implicit warnings that Canada would pay a steep human price if she were to be handed over.\n\n[Canada arrested Huawei's Meng for the United States. As China retaliates, it's on its own.]\n\nWeeks after Meng's arrest, China revisited a 15-year prison sentence for the Canadian Robert L. Schellenberg and raised his sentence to death for trafficking drugs. Last week, a Chinese court scheduled Schellenberg's appeal hearing to begin hours after Meng faced an extradition hearing of her own in Vancouver. After a Canadian court pushed back a decision in Meng's case, the Chinese court also announced it would delay announcing whether Schellenberg would be put to death.\n\nCanada has called on China to grant Schellenberg clemency and release Kovrig and Spavor. Meng's lawyers have argued that her constitutional rights were violated when she was interrogated for three hours at Vancouver's airport and should be released.\n\nKovrig and Spavor's arrest was first reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper on Thursday.\n\nSince December, Kovrig and Spavor have been kept in cells at undisclosed locations with lights on round-the-clock and without access to lawyers or family members, people familiar with the matter say. The two have been allowed short consular visits once a month, during which they are not allowed to discuss the cases against them with Canadian diplomats.\n\nThe men have told Canadian officials that they have not been physically mistreated aside from the extended sleep deprivation.\n\nA Canadian judge this month allowed Meng to move from a $4.2 million mansion into a bigger $10 million mansion -- she owns several homes in Canada -- due to security reasons.\n\nMeng must wear an ankle monitor as part of her bail terms but she is free to roam Vancouver between the hours of 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. while she awaits her next extradition hearing, scheduled for September.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8XyAOnmsjaltmvYDjbK7R6ueqgY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SOHLMDTXYUI6TPJFZGEVKXTXMY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4792077", "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 295699800}, {"uri": "1137373993", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-16", "time": "09:00:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-16T09:00:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/world/asia/china-canadian-arrested.html", "title": "China Charges 2 Canadians With Spying, Deepening a Political Standoff", "body": "BEIJING -- Two Canadian men detained in China since December have been formally arrested on espionage charges, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Thursday, in a move likely to ratchet up tensions between China and Canada that broke out with the arrest of a Chinese executive in Vancouver.\n\nMichael Kovrig, a former diplomat who was detained while visiting Beijing, was charged with \"gathering state secrets and intelligence for abroad,\" while Michael Spavor, a business consultant who was detained in northeast China, was accused of \"stealing and providing state secrets for abroad,\" Lu Kang, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, said at a regularly scheduled news briefing.\n\nThe vague reference to unspecified overseas entities left open the question of whether the men were suspected of working for a government or for some other organization.\n\nThe charges are likely to anger the government of Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who condemned the initial detentions of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor as \"arbitrary\" and politically motivated. Supporters of the two men and foreign legal experts have said that their detentions appeared to be retaliation for the arrest in Canada of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei, China's biggest telecommunications company, at the behest of the United States.\n\nMr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor were seized by the police in December, days after Ms. Meng was arrested while changing planes in Vancouver. The Chinese government was incensed by Ms. Meng's arrest, and the charging of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor makes it more likely that they will face trial and conviction, deepening the standoff with Mr. Trudeau's administration.\n\nMr. Lu did not provide further details and said only that the arrests were made recently.\n\n\"Everything in China is done in accordance with law,\" Mr. Lu said. Responding to a reporter's question about Canadian officials' criticism of how China handled the cases, he said: \"We hope Canada will not interfere with or comment casually on China's legal system and lawful practices.\"\n\nBefore the latest announcement, Chinese officials had already signaled that Mr. Kovrig and Spavor could be charged with espionage offenses.\n\nMr. Kovrig worked for the United Nations and the Canadian foreign service before 2017, when he joined the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization that tries to defuse conflicts between states. He focused on Chinese foreign policy, Asian regional politics and North Korea, and he was often quoted in foreign news outlets and invited to meetings in China.\n\nMr. Spavor followed a less conventional path, using his knowledge of the Korean language to establish himself as a consultant for companies and people interested in North Korea, including Dennis Rodman, the former basketball star who has befriended the North's leader, Kim Jong-un. Mr. Spavor was detained in Dandong, the Chinese city on the North Korean border where he was based.\n\nIn early March, a legal affairs committee within China's ruling Communist Party said investigators believed that Mr. Kovrig had been \"stealing and spying to obtain state secrets and intelligence,\" and that Mr. Spavor had supplied him with information.\n\nBut China's definition of state secrets can be sweeping and opaque, and the International Crisis Group has said Mr. Kovrig's work for it was in no way nefarious.\n\nSince they were detained, Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor have been held in secretive detention sites, without visits from lawyers and family members. Canadian diplomats have been allowed to visit them about once a month. Mr. Lu, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, did not respond to questions Thursday about where the two men were being held.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms. Meng has been granted bail as she fights potential extradition to the United States to face criminal charges. Her lawyers have said that they would sue Canadian border services, the police and the federal government for violating her constitutional rights when she was detained for three hours in December before being arrested.\n\nIn January, American prosecutors released an indictment of Ms. Meng and Huawei, laying out what they said were efforts by the company to steal commercial secrets, obstruct a criminal inquiry and engage in bank fraud while trying to evade American sanctions on Iran. Huawei has denied that it broke the law, and the Chinese government has repeatedly said that the charges were politically driven.\n\nThe Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, said at a news conference in early March that the case against Huawei and Ms. Meng was \"by no means a purely judicial case, but rather a deliberate political case\" intended to bring down Huawei. The United States has pressured allies not to use Huawei's technology, arguing that China could use it to spy on other countries.\n\nMr. Trudeau and Canadian and United States officials have said that the case against Ms. Meng is a legal matter, not a political one.

It singles out economic and industrial espionage as areas of particular concern.\n\n\"The President has made it clear that this Administration will do what it takes to keep America safe and prosperous, and to protect America from foreign adversaries who are actively and increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology infrastructure and services in the United States,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.\n\nThe order authorizes the commerce secretary to block transactions involving communications technologies built by firms controlled by a foreign adversary that puts U.S. security at \"unacceptable\" risk -- or poses a threat of espionage or sabotage to networks that underpin the day-to-day running of vital public services.\n\n[GOP senators raise alarms, criticize Trump as U.S.-China trade war heats up]\n\nWednesday's announcement was expected nearly a year ago, and comes as neither Washington nor Beijing appears willing to back down in their ongoing economic dispute. The National Economic Council, which had blocked the move for months, dropped its objection as trade talks hit an impasse, said one official.\n\nTrump's executive order does not immediately exclude any specific firms or countries, but certainly will not lessen tensions with Beijing. It is consistent with Trump's increasingly aggressive tack against China in which he has used tariffs as economic weapons, a tactic that he believes to be popular with his political base.\n\nThe move also boosts the administration's somewhat uphill effort to persuade allies and partners in Europe to bar Huawei, which officials say is beholden to the Chinese government, from their next-generation 5G wireless networks.\n\n[British government delivers scathing assessment of security risks posed by Huawei to U.K. telecom networks]\n\nThe order is not restricted to any one technology, such as 5G, but instead covers a swath of information communications technologies. That could invite a legal challenge from companies who believe it is overly broad, officials and analysts say.\n\nTrump declared the emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1977 law used by every president since Jimmy Carter to impose sanctions on countries such as Iran or Russia. It gives the president broad authority over economic activity.\n\nTrump's executive order instructs the commerce secretary to develop an enforcement regime and permits the secretary to name companies or technologies that could be barred, according to officials.\n\nShould that happen, said Paul Rosenzweig, a former homeland security official in the George W. Bush administration, the banned firm \"would assuredly sue.\" Rosenzweig, now a senior fellow with the R Street Institute, a policy group that advocates free markets, said that congressional action to bar a specific firm likely would have a better chance at withstanding legal scrutiny.\n\nThe order acknowledges that, although an open investment climate is generally positive, the United States needs to do more to protect the security of its networks. The idea is to have an \"in case of emergency, break glass\" authority, said one U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before it was released.\n\nAnd though the president already may veto proposed acquisitions of American companies by foreign buyers if he believes they endanger national security, the government lacks the authority to intervene in specific transactions deemed to pose such a risk.\n\n\"There are other levers we have, based more on contracting influence and power of the purse, but this would be more of an explicit exclusionary authority,\" said an official familiar with the matter.\n\n[U.S. officials planning for a future in which Huawei has a major share of 5G global networks]\n\nLast year Trump signed a law that barred the federal government and its contractors from doing business with Huawei and several other Chinese firms on national security grounds. And the country's four major telecom carriers have committed to the federal government that they will not use Huawei equipment in their networks.\n\nBut this order, once implemented, would establish a national policy applying to commercial entities outside the U.S. government and permits the commerce secretary to name the countries and organizations subject to the restrictions, as well as the technologies at issue. The order also would permit the secretary to direct the timing and manner of how U.S. firms would cease using such equipment, officials said.\n\nA number of rural carriers use Huawei in their networks as a lower-cost alternative to European firms such as Nokia and Ericsson. The Federal Communications Commission is preparing a rule that likely would restrict federal subsidies to carriers that use Huawei gear and the rural carriers have told the government that replacing Huawei is a cost they cannot afford.\n\nA number of European officials in recent months have expressed consternation that the United States is pressing them to block Huawei from their planned 5G networks while not having officially banned the firm. This order helps counter that objection, officials said.\n\nSecurity officials say the issue is one of national security, not trade. But the two inevitably have become linked as China's quest to dominate advanced technologies in the global market has prompted significant concerns about the potential for espionage or sabotage.\n\nTrump, unlike most previous presidents, has frequently relied on national security arguments in his bid to reshape U.S. trading relationships, demonstrating a willingness to stretch legal authorities beyond their customary bounds.\n\nLast year, for instance, he cited a little-used national security provision of a 1962 law to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. He also has ordered the Commerce Department to investigate doing the same on foreign-made automobiles and auto parts.\n\nThe national emergency declaration comes a day after a congressional hearing in which senators from both parties joined administration officials in calling out the risks of doing business with a company like Huawei. They emphasized that the problem was less about the company than the authoritarian country whose system of laws, which lacks due process and transparency, it must obey.\n\n\"It's not about overseeing Huawei. It's about overseeing China,\" said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the hearing on 5G security.\n\n\"This is a single-party government,\" said Christopher Krebs, director of the Homeland Security Department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. \"Everything that flows from the central party is a manifestation of their philosophy.'", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/K_Ki0q1u3CCu0K-IPot4-nkE3hs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5IUH2NTWSYI6TPJFZGEVKXTXMY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4786358", "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 295650360}, {"uri": "1136992518", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-15", "time": "20:55:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-15T20:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/business/huawei-ban-trump.html", "title": "Trump Moves to Ban Foreign Telecom Gear, Targeting Huawei and Escalating Battle With China", "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump moved on Wednesday to ban American telecommunications firms from installing foreign-made equipment that could pose a threat to national security, White House officials said, stepping up a battle against China by effectively barring sales by Huawei, the country's leading networking company.\n\nMr. Trump issued an executive order instructing the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, to ban transactions \"posing an unacceptable risk\" but did not single out any nation or company. The action has long been expected and is the latest salvo in the administration's economic and security battle with China. It is also the most extreme move in the Trump administration's fight against China's tech sector.\n\nLed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, American officials have warned allies for months that the United States would stop sharing intelligence if they use Huawei and other Chinese technology to build the core of their fifth-generation, or 5G, networks. The networks promise not only faster cellular service, but also the connection of billions of \"internet of things\" devices -- such as autonomous cars, security cameras and industrial equipment -- to a new internet architecture.\n\nPentagon and American intelligence officials have warned that Chinese firms will be able to control the networks and have expressed concerns not only that secure messages could be intercepted or secretly diverted to China, but that the Chinese authorities could order Huawei to shut down the networks during any conflict, disrupting American infrastructure as diverse as gas pipelines and cellphone networks.\n\nHuawei has denied those charges, and its chief executive has said he would shut down the company rather than obey Chinese government orders to intercept or divert internet traffic. American officials say he would have no choice: Chinese law requires that the country's firms obey instructions from the nation's Ministry of State Security.\n\nMr. Trump has been deeply involved, quietly meeting with American telecommunications executives at the White House and weighing different versions of the executive order. He has insisted that the United States must \"win\" at the 5G competition, only to be told that no American firms make the core switches that will direct 5G internet traffic.\n\nThe executive order came amid an escalating trade war between the United States and China, with the two sides imposing hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs in recent days. Mr. Trump has accused the Chinese government of unfair trade practices and announced increased tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods last week.\n\nBut few issues have gained as much bipartisan support in Washington as the Trump administration's warnings of the security threats posed by Huawei and ZTE, another company with deep links to the Chinese government. The calls have gotten so intense that some have warned of a new red scare, and Chinese officials have said the United States has moved beyond caution to paranoia.\n\nThe major mobile phone companies have renounced the use of Huawei equipment in their 5G systems, but the order will ensure that smaller, rural telecom companies avoid Huawei when they build new networks.\n\nBecause 5G systems feature high-speed, low-range equipment, the technology is more suited for now for urban areas than rural areas. But Huawei remains appealing to rural networks because it is cheaper than alternatives.\n\nThe ban could also help with the Trump administration's campaign to get European allies to block Huawei. Some allies had questioned why they should block Huawei if the United States had not. Other European officials have suspected that Mr. Trump will soften or eliminate the ban as part of a trade deal with China. Most major allies have resisted the Trump administration's push, except Australia, which banned Huawei last summer.\n\nThe White House, intelligence officials and lawmakers from both parties argue that China has already shaped its telecommunications and that tech industries have also given rise inside Chinese territory to facial recognition, constant surveillance of the population and human rights abuses.\n\nAmerican officials have also warned that China's exports of Huawei and other tech products have allowed other authoritarian nations to spy on their citizens and access sensitive security and trade secrets.\n\nBut even if Huawei is banned from the United States, it will likely control 40 to 60 percent of the networks around the world. It has made a strong marketing pitch in Africa, Latin America and parts of Asia where it holds huge economic influence. American officials have said China has offered subsidized prices and low-interest loans to outmaneuver the few Western competitors, chiefly Nokia and Ericsson, both European firms.\n\nThe United States will have to connect to those nations -- and must prepare for a day when the American government and companies will have to live in \"dirty networks,\" Sue Gordon, the deputy director of national intelligence, recently warned.\n\nIn January, prosecutors in Washington State charged two units of Huawei of conspiring to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile and of wire fraud.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he doubted that Chinese companies could meet American standards and laws on surveillance.\n\n\"There is no way in hell China can meet those criteria because of the way they're governed,\" Mr. Graham said at a hearing this week. \"The only way China can meet the criteria is to stop being China.\"\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission is considering regulations that would bar broadband providers that receive federal subsidies from using Huawei or ZTE equipment in their networks. The biggest American carriers have little equipment from the companies, but some rural telecom providers have expressed concern over how to rid their networks, which contain parts from various equipment makers, of Chinese products.\n\nThe commission recently approved an order that barred China Mobile Limited from providing service in the United States.

(Qilai Shen/Bloomberg) By Henry Olsen Henry Olsen Columnist focusing on politics, populism, and American conservative thought Columnist May 15 at 4:25 PM\n\nChina's decision to hike its tariffs on U.S. imports has raised the stakes in President Trump's incipient trade war. To win, he's going to need help from a group he's already on rocky terms with: our allies.\n\nThe United States might be China's most important market, but it is far from its only one. The European Union is the second-biggest importer of Chinese goods after the United States, and China is its second-largest market for exports. Europe also ran a roughly $207 billion trade deficit with China in goods in 2018. U.S. markets and technology are important to China, but the E.U. could easily provide an alternative source of minds, money and markets for China if it does not support Trump's actions.\n\nOther U.S. allies face challenges. Australia, for example, is a huge net exporter of raw materials to China. Australia has not suffered a recession since 1991, and Chinese appetite for the gold and other minerals that lie beneath Australia's surface is a big reason why. Most economists expect that U.S. tariffs will cut China's economic growth, which in turn will reduce its demand for Australian imports. Trump's actions will affect our longtime ally as surely as they harm U.S. farmers.\n\nJapan and South Korea, two countries that along with Australia are the United States' strongest Asian allies, also have extensive trade ties with China. They are net exporters of capital goods, machinery and electronics, and chemicals to China. Again, any decrease in Chinese growth will reduce demand for these products, which in turn will harm their domestic economies.\n\nMost of these countries share U.S. concerns about Chinese growth in influence and military power, although Asian countries feel the effects more directly. Japan is increasing its own naval capacity to combat China's fast-growing navy, for example, and Australia banned Chinese companies such as Huawei as it develops its 5G network. They are not oblivious to the potential threat the communist government poses to their security, and they thus are inclined to back U.S. actions to restrain China's growth if it continues to act in irresponsible ways.\n\nBut almost all of these countries are also locked in their own trade battles with the United States, placing their cooperation in our fight with China in peril. Trump has also imposed or threatened to impose tariffs on goods from the E.U. and Japan. Those tariffs have pushed both Japan and the E.U. into trade talks with the United States, which are nowhere close to completion. Trump currently has to decide by May 18 whether he is going to impose more tariffs on automobile imports.\n\nThe fight with China is too large and too important for Trump to risk allied cooperation over U.S. trade disputes with our allies. European and Japanese competition may harm many U.S. industries, although as with all global trade, it also creates winners among U.S. firms and helps many consumers. More importantly, Japan and the E.U. do not pose a potential existential threat to the United States. Their militaries are small and rely on the United States for defense and intelligence. They are also free and democratic states and are not promoting an alternative social, political and economic system.\n\nChina will inevitably try to ratchet up the pressure on the United States if Trump holds firm. That will include more than just hurting U.S. farmers and exporters; it will include trying to woo U.S. allies with favorable deals to find alternatives to the United States. When that happens, Trump will need them to reject overtures that might be tempting and might be in those nation's and region's short-term interests. They will be much less likely to do that if they are embroiled in their own trade disputes with us.\n\nEven the United States is not large enough and powerful enough to fight the entire world at once. The global trading economy did not arise overnight, and it will not be reformed overnight. Chinese authoritarian expansion poses a unique and genuine national security threat to the United States and the entire free world.

(Kin Cheung/AP) By Martin Lee May 15 at 4:39 PM\n\nMartin Lee is the founder of Hong Kong's Democratic Party.\n\nFor generations, Hong Kong has been a safe harbor from the chaos of Communist China.\n\nYet in January 2017, Chinese Canadian billionaire businessman Xiao Jianhua was abducted in Hong Kong from the Four Seasons Hotel by mainland agents, spirited off to China and not seen since. In 2015, five Hong Kong publishers vanished. One of them, Lam Wing-kee, recalled how he was kidnapped and forced to make a televised confession. \"I also want to tell the whole world,\" Lam said after escaping. \"This isn't about me, this isn't about a bookstore. This is about everyone.\" He was right.\n\nWhy were these people abducted? Because there is no extradition law between Hong Kong and China. There is no extradition law because there is no rule of law in China, where the Chinese Communist Party dictates who is innocent and who is guilty. For the same reason, the United States has no extradition arrangements with China (though it does with Hong Kong).\n\nThe Hong Kong government is poised to pass an extradition law that will legalize such kidnappings and threatens to destroy Hong Kong's free society. If the United States and other governments around the world don't act immediately to pressure Beijing and Hong Kong to withdraw the changes, the law could be rubber-stamped into effect as early as next week.\n\nThe law will allow Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who has shown no independence from Beijing, to transfer anyone at China's request. All that will be needed to set the process in motion is a simple affidavit that a \"crime\" of some kind has happened. Needless to say, this is a mockery of the rule of law.\n\nIn April, 130,000 Hong Kong citizens turned out in our city's narrow streets to oppose extradition to China. But public opinion can't stop this law.\n\nOver the past few years, Beijing disqualified six elected Hong Kong pro-democracy legislators by bogus means, and it now fully controls the legislature. Despite efforts by democratically elected legislators -- including unprecedented fisticuffs in the Legislative Council last Saturday -- the Hong Kong government has the votes to pass the extradition law quickly.\n\nThe United States has a special interest in blocking this law -- and indeed may be Beijing's special target of the law. There are about 85,000 U.S. citizens living or working in Hong Kong, which for decades has been their safe harbor for those operating in greater China -- teachers and preachers, as well as executives of 1,300 U.S. companies in Hong Kong, including financial services firms and technology giants such as Google.\n\nBeijing could extradite Americans in Hong Kong on trumped-up charges as a way to extract company trade secrets, software and other intellectual property. Americans either residing in Hong Kong or visiting Hong Kong could end up jailed in China.\n\nThe American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong strongly objected to the proposed extradition law, citing \"grave concerns\" about the absence of the rule of law in China. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a group that advises Congress, says the change in extradition law \"could pose significant risk to U.S. national security and economic interests in the territory,\" allowing \"Beijing to pressure the Hong Kong government to extradite U.S. citizens under false pretenses.\" The commission noted that U.S. Navy personnel could be at risk during routine port calls in Hong Kong's deep harbor.\n\nThe heart of this crisis is that Beijing views extradition as a political tool -- not as a legal matter. In the case of Canada's arrest of the chief financial officer of mainland telecommunications giant Huawei, Beijing objects to Canada extraditing the accused to the United States to face charges. Characteristically, the Chinese government is treating the case as a matter of international politics, not extradition law.\n\nThe Hong Kong government claims it is rushing through changes in extradition to close a so-called legal loophole -- but this supposed loophole has existed for more than two decades. The loophole is no threat to Hong Kong freedoms, whereas the proposed amendments to the extradition law certainly are.\n\nBy demanding this law, Beijing violates the spirit of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, with its \"one country, two systems\" pledge that Hong Kong would not be forced to adopt Communist laws and systems and could remain an international city safeguarded by the rule of law.\n\nHong Kong became a world-class city in part because of the trade that flows through our harbor. If this extradition law is passed, Americans, Canadians and many other nationalities could become potential hostages to extradition claims driven by the political agenda of Beijing.\n\nThe time for the world to act to protect Hong Kong's free society and legal system is now -- not when Hong Kong people and others are taken to be jailed in China.\n\nThe Post's View: Hong Kong's new extradition laws open the gates to Chinese repression\n\nThe Post's View: China's repression in Hong Kong is hurting its own cause\n\nThe Post's View: Hong Kong's rapid descent into repression", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/E6BItUDMsFKFwhfL8hHY1QVMvaA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BHKQ4EDUTEI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4786407", "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 295649520}, {"uri": "1136926807", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-15", "time": "19:03:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-15T19:03:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5372549295425415, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/world/australia/bill-shorten.html", "title": "Bill Shorten Wants Australia to Embrace China. But at What Cost?", "body": "SYDNEY, Australia -- In a recent online discussion, Bill Shorten, the front-runner in the race to be Australia's next prime minister, left little doubt about where he stood on the politically delicate issue of relations with China -- and where the world's other superpower fit into his calculus.\n\n\"If I'm P.M., I welcome the rise of China in the world,\" he said in a post on the Chinese social media platform WeChat that was aimed at Australia's 1.2 million voters of Chinese descent. Mr. Shorten, the leader of the center-left Labor Party, added that he saw China not as a \"strategic threat,\" but as a \"strategic opportunity.\"\n\nThose words put him directly at odds with the Trump administration, which has sounded alarms about China's global ambitions and tactics. But Mr. Shorten, while acknowledging that Australia would always be an ally of the United States, declared that it was time for his nation \"to stand on its own feet and think for itself.\"\n\nIf Mr. Shorten's party prevails in Saturday's election, his embrace of China would represent a significant break from the current conservative Australian government, which has taken a harder line toward Beijing's growing influence in the country and whose leader, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, is an avowed admirer of President Trump. It could also signify a crack in the united front that the Trump administration is trying to build to check China's ascent.\n\nFor Mr. Shorten, the calculation may be largely about economics. The Labor leader, whose campaign has promised significant spending to bolster public health programs, education and wages, is hoping that improved relations with China, Australia's biggest trading partner, will keep the economy growing.\n\nMr. Morrison, whose conservative coalition has narrowed the gap with Mr. Shorten's Labor Party in polls but is still trailing, has focused his election message on the notion that Labor's spending plans would send the economy into a recession. That is a frightening prospect to Australians who have known only economic expansion for a generation.\n\nBut critics fear that any softening toward China could have much broader ramifications, putting pressure on Australia, for instance, to roll back its clampdown on foreign interference or to keep silent on Chinese human rights abuses.\n\nMr. Morrison's warier stance on China was crystallized by remarks he made on Monday when asked about the protracted trade war between Washington and Beijing. He said that he would not pick sides, saying, \"You stand by your friends, and you stand by your customers as well.\"\n\nThe prime minister's branding of China as a \"customer\" drew derision from Mr. Shorten, who promised \"a bit more sophistication\" in handling ties between the countries. For decades, Australia's economy has been buoyed by the export of natural resources to China, as well as money from Chinese students, tourists and investors.\n\nIt's clear which leader Chinese officials prefer: Social media accounts on WeChat affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party have mocked Mr. Morrison and his government. One account disparaged \"a country whose head has been kicked hard by kangaroos\" and now wanted to be friends again after a rough patch.\n\nRegardless of who wins the election, Australia will continue to face profound questions over how it balances the economic necessity of cooperating with China with the imperative of protecting its national security interests. Australia is also grappling with its place in the Asia-Pacific region, and the world beyond, as China seeks to expand its economic and military power.\n\nThe relationship between the two countries has grown strained in recent years as the Australian government, heeding warnings from national security leaders, has pushed back against Beijing's attempts to expand its reach within the country's corporations, universities and national institutions, including Parliament.\n\nThe Australian government passed legislation cracking down on foreign interference and secret lobbying on behalf of foreign interests. It also banned the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from seeking a contract to install fifth-generation cellular networks in Australia, citing potential threats to national security.\n\nBeijing, in turn, has held up Australian coal and wine imports, and is believed to be behind a cyberattack that infiltrated the networks of the federal Parliament and the three main political parties. (China has dismissed the hacking allegations as a smear campaign.)\n\nChina has also bypassed the federal government by signing deals with individual Australian states as part of its gargantuan Belt and Road infrastructure initiative -- a global push that the United States and other critics say has lacked transparency and trapped partners in debt.\n\nWhile it is seen as unlikely that Mr. Shorten, who declined requests for an interview, would reverse the government's ban on Huawei, his party has indicated that it is open to signing on to the Belt and Road program.\n\n\"The fact that Australia is this ally that sits geographically parked in the Asia-Pacific does put it very much in the cross hairs of China's worldview, particularly on the idea of splintering and weakening the U.S. alliance system,\" said Euan Graham, the executive director of La Trobe Asia, a department of La Trobe University in Melbourne.\n\nThe Labor Party has traditionally promoted itself as more independent of American foreign policy compared with the conservative coalition, which under Prime Minister John Howard sent Australian troops into Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Shorten said that Mr. Trump's views on some issues were \"barking mad.\" When asked by a television audience this year how he would reconcile those comments should he meet with Mr. Trump as prime minister, Mr. Shorten said he would deal with Mr. Trump \"professionally and politely.\"\n\n\"But you ask, China or America? In Australia, we're smart enough to work with all of them to Australia's long-term interest if we behave in a smart and respectful fashion,\" Mr. Shorten told the audience.\n\nTwo recent cases involving public figures with ties to Australia may offer a glimpse of how Mr. Shorten would carry out that \"respectful\" approach.\n\nMr. Shorten has been reluctant to publicly criticize China over its detention of a Chinese-Australian novelist, Yang Hengjun, saying the case should not be handled through \"megaphone diplomacy.\" But in the case of Bahraini soccer player Hakeem al-Araibi, who had been granted asylum in Australia, Mr. Shorten's party directly contacted the authorities in Thailand, where Mr. al-Araibi was being held, to urge his release.\n\nIf China senses a friendlier stance from a Labor government, human rights is likely to be one of the areas where it would try to push first, said Giovanni Di Lieto, an international trade law expert at Monash University in Melbourne.\n\n\"That will be the real litmus test,\" he said.\n\nMr. Shorten is hoping to shift the debate on the proper approach toward China, which has largely been driven by a sharp divide between the country's business community and its national security establishment.\n\nConnections to China run deep in the Labor Party, and have been a sore point at times. One of Mr. Shorten's mentors, former Prime Minister Paul Keating, was until recently the chairman of the advisory board for the China Development Bank, which has poured nearly $200 billion into Belt and Road projects.\n\nAnd Bob Carr, a former Labor foreign minister, has essentially become one of the Chinese government's most effective spokesmen, and now heads a university institute dedicated to Chinese-Australian relations.\n\nWhile the governing coalition has had its share of China-connected scandals as well, the shadows have been especially hard for Labor to cast off.\n\nDuring one election campaign debate, a coalition government minister began reeling off the names of past Labor politicians who had taken on Chinese-funded roles after leaving politics.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_tarabay@nytimes.com", "name": "Jamie Tarabay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/world/15oz-shorten-1/15oz-shorten-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4785042", "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 295642980}, {"uri": "1136710759", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-15", "time": "14:11:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-15T14:11:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8235294222831726, "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hes-a-tough-man-trump-shrugs-off-concerns-about-hungarys-hard-right-leader-during-white-house-visit/2019/05/13/2fe20b5e-7592-11e9-b7ae-390de4259661_story.html", "title": "Trump Shrugs Off Concerns About Hungary's Hard-Right Leader During White House Visit", "body": "Coast Guard officer accused of plotting terrorist attack to remain jailed, judge says\n\nPresident Trump delighted Monday in welcoming Hungary's hard-right leader to the White House, an invitation the two most recent U.S. presidents -- one a Democrat and one a Republican -- had purposefully not extended.\n\nTrump's meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Orban was a thumb of the nose to his predecessors and the premise that foreign leaders who cavalierly reject concerns about human rights and free elections while flirting with U.S. rivals should not be afforded the coveted badge of respect that comes with an Oval Office visit.\n\nSeated beside Orban in the high-backed gold chairs he uses to receive foreign visitors, Trump said Orban has \"done a tremendous job in so many ways\" and has \"kept his country safe.\"\n\n\"Highly respected,\" Trump continued. \"Respected all over Europe. Probably like me a little bit controversial, but that's okay.\"\n\nTrump said the two would discuss trade and shared NATO concerns, but he did not publicly mention Hungary's slide into authoritarianism, its human rights and free speech abuses or growing anti-Semitism.\n\nA smile played around Orban's lips as he watched the chaotic scene of reporters jostling and shouting questions amid a phalanx of photographers angling for position.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Orban thanked Trump for the invitation and noted the two-decade interval since his last trip to see a U.S. president. He said he and Trump have \"similar approaches\" to many global issues.\n\n\"We are proud to stand together with the United States on fighting against illegal migration, on terrorism, and to protect and help the Christian communities all around the world,\" Orban said.\n\nTrump responded in kind.\n\n\"You have been great with respect to Christian communities,\" he said. \"You have really put a block up, and we appreciate that very much.\"\n\nIn office for nine years this time and once before for four, Orban has morphed from a crusading anti-Soviet reformer embraced by President Bill Clinton to an increasingly autocratic figure who has erected a fence along his country's southern border to keep out migrants and asylum seekers.\n\nThe Oval Office invitation is a coup for Orban, who has shrugged off his outcast status in Europe but is seeking a measure of rehabilitation ahead of elections to the European Parliament next month.\n\nThe Trump administration has largely shrugged off Orban's anti-democratic actions and said that the invitation is less an embrace of a like-minded figure and more about heading off Orban's drift toward U.S. competitors Russia and China.\n\nThe invitation was somewhat slow in coming, at least by Trump standards. Orban is the last Central European leader to get the nod, although he was the first foreign leader to endorse then-candidate Trump, in 2016.\n\nFormer Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon once admiringly said that Orban was \"Trump before Trump.\"\n\nOrban, 55, is the latest in a list of strongmen to get the one-on-one treatment at the White House. Other recent examples include the right-wing or autocratic leaders of Poland, Egypt, Brazil and Austria.\n\n\"It still remains rightly shocking to see Trump cozy up to authoritarian leaders,\" said Amanda Sloat, a former State Department official who is now at the Brookings Institution. \"The American president should be supporting democratic allies with shared values rather than autocrats who are actively undermining U.S. interests.\"\n\nTrump's ambassador to Hungary, New York financier and Trump friend David Cornstein, told The Atlantic recently that Trump \"would love to have the situation that Viktor Orban has, but he doesn't.\"\n\nA senior administration official told reporters Friday that Cornstein's remark may have been \"taken out of context\" but did not offer detail on what the ambassador meant.\n\nCornstein also told the magazine that he did not expect that Orban's targeting of an American university in Budapest founded by liberal Hungarian American donor George Soros would have much effect on U.S. relations with Hungary.\n\n\"I'm hopeful we can turn the page and move on to other subjects,\" he said.\n\nOrban has used familiar and veiled anti-Semitic references in attacking Soros as a \"crafty\" interloper who uses money to meddle in the country's affairs, and he has sought to link Soros with Muslim and other migrants Orban says would overrun the country.\n\nCountries that accept Syrian and other migrants are creating \"mixed-race nations\" and putting their history and traditions at risk, Orban said in a speech in February.\n\nHis political party was suspended from the right-wing People's Party, its perch in the European Parliament, over its anti-democratic actions.\n\nA bipartisan letter Friday from four members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee rued \"Hungary's downward democratic trajectory and the implications for U.S. interests in Central Europe.\"\n\nCommittee Chairman James E. Risch (R-Idaho), a Trump ally, was among the signers.\n\n\"We remain profoundly concerned about the close relationship between this NATO partner and Moscow,\" the letter said.\n\nBriefing reporters ahead of the visit, two Trump administration officials said the United States has put its concerns about the university, anti-Semitism and migration issues directly to Orban in other meetings, including lengthy discussions with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThe officials said the visit is part of a broader outreach to Central and Eastern Europe, rather than a personal reward for Orban.\n\nMain items on the agenda included U.S. concerns about European expansion of Chinese tech firm Huawei, European energy security and the potential for increased weapons sales to Hungary, the officials said.\n\n\"The point of this meeting is simply just to reinforce the strategic relationship between allies, NATO allies of U.S. and Hungary,\" one official said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the session, \"not necessarily just thrash out every issue on the bilateral agenda, which we have been doing constantly for the last two years.\"\n\nTrump didn't seem interested in thrashing out any contentious issues with Orban -- at least not publicly.\n\nToward the end of the Oval Office question-and-answer session, Trump was asked whether he is concerned about \"democratic backsliding\" in Hungary.\n\n\"Well, people have a lot of respect for this prime minister,\" Trump replied. \"He's a respected man. I know he's a tough man, but he's a respected man, and he's done the right thing, according to many people, on immigration.\"\n\nIn other settings, Trump has been harshly critical of more liberal immigration policies in Western Europe, especially in Germany and France.\n\n\"And you look at some of the problems that they have in Europe that are tremendous because they've done it a different way than the prime minister,\" Trump said Monday.\n\nTrump then invited Orban to say his piece.\n\n\"From the people, by the people, for the people,\" Orban replied, his tone clipped. \"This is the basis for the Hungarian government, so it's a government which is elected by the Hungarian people several times,\" Orban said. \"So we are happy to serve our nation.\"\n\nIndependent election monitors have found that Hungarian elections have become less free, and the Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe was critical of the Orban government's propaganda campaign during the most recent election in 2018.\n\n\"Fundamental rights and freedoms were respected overall, but exercised in an adverse climate,\" OSCE monitors wrote.\n\nTrump, wagging his index finger, closed off further discussion of Hungarian democracy by noting that the country is \"a very good member of NATO, and I don't think we can go into too much of a discussion unless that's mentioned.\"\n\nThis article was written by Anne Gearan from The Washington Post and was legally licensed through the NewsCred publisher network.

(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nTrump administration officials have warned for months that Huawei's global expansion into next-generation 5G wireless networks would amplify the threat of Chinese digital spying.\n\nBut now they're taking the gloves off, accusing the Chinese government of running roughshod over international norms and its own laws to steal Western innovations. The stepped up rhetoric comes as President Trump imposed high tariffs on a wide range of Chinese imports, leading to a major escalation in trade hostilities between the two countries.\n\nThe move to 5G makes concerns about spying and sabotage significantly more pressing because its super-fast speeds will allow far more systems critical to public safety to run on wireless internet connections, such as high-tech medical equipment and driverless cars.\n\nIf Huawei gains a foothold in U.S. allies' 5G networks, the Chinese government could force the company to send software updates to spy on Western companies or sabotage critical infrastructure, Chris Krebs, director of the Homeland Security Department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, warned lawmakers during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday.\n\nBeijing could also exploit hidden vulnerabilities that already exist in Huawei products to hack adversaries or it could plant spies inside Huawei teams that work abroad servicing the company's technology, Krebs said.\n\n\"It's not about overseeing Huawei. It's about overseeing China,\" Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (S.C.) said during the hearing.\n\nAdministration officials formerly attributed their concerns about Huawei to a 2017 cybersecurity law they said would force the company to cooperate with Chinese intelligence requests. But Krebs abandoned that nicety Tuesday.\n\n\"This is a single-party government. Everything that flows from the central party is a manifestation of their philosophy,\" he said. \"The [cybersecurity] law is important because it is telling you what they want to do. But they're going to get what they want anyway, law or not.\"\n\nThe U.S. and China stepped away from trade negotiations last week amid recriminations, and the heightened rhetoric on digital spying probably will make tensions worse.\n\nThe White House, which has struggled to convince allies to restrict Huawei from their 5G networks, may also impose its own ban on Huawei as soon as this week, Reuters reported Tuesday.\n\nLawmakers are also taking a cue from the administration and moving to restrict China from access to U.S. technological innovations.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a bill to bar exporting large categories of technologies to China including artificial intelligence, robotics, semiconductors and advanced construction equipment.\n\nHawley and five other Republicans also proposed another bill to bar Chinese students from science or engineering schools connected with the People's Liberation Army from receiving U.S. visas.\n\n\"This is a strategy with multiple tentacles,\" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said, describing Chinese digital spying efforts, \"and we as members of Congress need to understand every one of those and chop them off.\"\n\nHuawei officials, meanwhile, described the company as caught in a big power dispute between the United States and China in which the risk the company poses is being mischaracterized and misunderstood.\n\nHuawei's argues U.S. officials' concerns about back doors in Huawei products can be addressed with regular audits and risk assessments -- and that wireless carriers can vet any software updates to ensure they're similarly free of back doors, Huawei Chief Security Officer Andy Purdy told me.\n\nSimilar assessments should be done on any 5G technology vendor because even technology that is designed to be as secure as possible probably will contain some bugs that sophisticated hackers can exploit, said Purdy, who was a top DHS cybersecurity official during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nBut those arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears, Purdy said.\n\n\"We'd welcome the opportunity to talk to these folks,\" he said, \"to talk about policy and to help them understand the nature of the risks.\"\n\nPINGED: Exclusive to the Cybersecurity 202: Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) plans to reintroduce today an election security bill that mandates paper ballots and post-election audits and would grant DHS broad authority to set mandatory cybersecurity requirements for voting machines, voter registration databases and election results websites.\n\nIt's the first standalone Senate bill this Congress that would force major reforms to election security. It comes after Russian hackers probed numerous election systems in 2016 and penetrated a handful of voter registration databases.\n\nThe updated version of the Protecting American Votes and Elections Act, would authorize $500 million in grants to states to pay for new machines to count paper ballots. It would also authorize $250 million for ballot marking machines to be used by people with disabilities that can't use paper ballots.\n\nThe bill has already been endorsed by numerous election security advocacy groups including the National Election Defense Coalition and the Brennan Center for Justice as well as by Stacey Abrams, a Democrat who narrowly lost a race to be Georgia's governor in November. Georgia is considered a laggard on election security and was one of five states that lacked paper ballot record for all races in 2018.\n\nWyden's bill won numerous Democratic co-sponsors last Congress but didn't get any support from Republicans who are far warier about imposing specific election security requirements on states.\n\nThis version of the bill comes with a dozen Democratic co-sponsors, including presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Cory Booker (N.J.), Kirten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Kamala Harris (Calif.).\n\nPATCHED: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) confirmed after an FBI briefing Tuesday that Russian hackers gained access to voter registration databases in two Florida counties ahead of the 2016 election, the Associated Press's Brendan Farrington reported.\n\n\"DeSantis said the hackers didn't manipulate any data and the election results weren't compromised,\" Farrington reported. The governor was barred by the FBI from revealing the counties, but said officials there know about the breaches.\n\nThe news helps explain a portion of the Mueller report, which stated that FBI officials believed Russian hackers penetrated the networks of \"at least one\" Florida county before the 2016 election. It doesn't explain, however, why the FBI is only confirming the breaches now - or why they didn't alert Florida state government officials at the time.\n\nSen.

(Christopher Goodney/Bloomberg News)\n\nThe Democratic presidential field for 2020 hasn't talked much about cybersecurity, but one candidate wants to change that.\n\nJohn Delaney, a former House member from Maryland, has proposed creating a new Cabinet-level cybersecurity department if he's elected. And he wants other candidates to start talking more about an issue that roiled the 2016 presidential election when Russian hackers compromised Democratic databases in an effort to sink the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"I want the Democratic Party to talk more about the stuff that matters to most Americans, and I think things like digital privacy and cybersecurity matter to a lot of people,\" Delaney told me. \"People feel really vulnerable out there and their government doesn't do anything to help them.\"\n\nThe new cybersecurity department would be in charge of most of the civilian government's cybersecurity efforts, including helping state and local governments secure their election systems and working with the private sector, Delaney told me. In other cases, it would be responsible for helping other agencies ensure their data and computer networks are secure.\n\n\"When you're thinking about the main risks going forward, it's hard to think this isn't one of the top five risks and the fact that the president of the United States doesn't have someone sitting around the Cabinet table whose sole purpose is to defend us against those threats is an indefensible position,\" he said.\n\nDelaney isn't the only 2020 candidate who is making cybersecurity part of his pitch, but other Democrats in the race to challenge President Trump have focused more narrowly on securing elections after the Russian hacking operation and disinformation campaign spread on social media platforms like Facebook.\n\nAll of the 2016 Democrats have vowed not to use hacked materials in their campaigns -- with some caveats. And Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) have both made their push for legislation to require paper ballots or backups a talking point at campaign events.\n\nDelaney is polling in the low single digits in Iowa but hopes that proposing solutions to big problems can boost his standing with voters. His other major policy proposals include a national strategy for artificial intelligence and a Peace Corps-style initiative focused on combating climate change.\n\n\"I think what most Americans say is they want someone who's focused on where the world is going and has real solutions, which is what I'm trying to do,\" he said.\n\nDelaney's interest in cybersecurity was partly sparked by the 2015 Office of Personnel Management breach, which compromised the sensitive security clearance information of more than 20 million current and former federal government employees -- a large portion of them from his Maryland congressional district.\n\nHis proposal for a cybersecurity department could help prevent the next OPM breach, he said -- by making protecting government networks a higher priority and by placing someone in the Cabinet whose sole job is to ensure there is enough money and sufficient resources to guarantee that protection.\n\nThe idea of a cybersecurity department has been batted around for years and the leaders of the Senate Homeland Security Committee are mulling a similar idea this Congress. The idea also has plenty of critics, however, including Suzanne Spaulding, who formerly led the Homeland Security Department division that's the government's lead cybersecurity agency now.\n\nSpaulding argued in a December paper with national security scholar Mieke Eoyang that creating a cybersecurity department would be an unnecessary and confusing bureaucratic shuffle that wouldn't improve government's cybersecurity posture and might even make it worse.\n\nThey pointed to some simpler changes they say have significantly improved government's cybersecurity -- such as a new law allowing DHS to mandate that other agencies adopt cybersecurity protections. The paper, which came out before Delaney's proposal, was bluntly titled: \"Bad Idea: Creating a U.S. Department of Cybersecurity.\"\n\nDelaney brushed off those concerns, however, saying people in government \"don't like change\" and routinely \"defend the status quo.\"\n\n\"We can all agree this is a massive threat and it's growing,\" he said. \"The government ... and private sector would benefit immensely from a [Cabinet-level] agency focused on it.\"\n\nDuring a wide-ranging interview, Denaley expressed support for most Democratic positions on cybersecurity issues.\n\nHe's deeply concerned about the possibility of Kremlin hackers interfering in 2020, he said, and favors tying federal grants to state and local election offices to requirements they meet minimal cybersecurtiy requirements and use paper ballots.\n\nHe also supports Trump administration efforts to limit the Chinese telecom Huawei's role in building next-generation global 5G wireless networks out of concerns it could help Beijing spying efforts. And he considers Chinese state-sponsored theft of American companies' intellectual property far more dangerous than the trade deficit that prompted the president's push for heavy tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nDelaney also said he generally supports the Trump administration's efforts to cow the nation's digital adversaries by launching more offensive hacking operations -- but worries about Trump's hesitance to criticize Russia for its efforts to undermine the 2016 election.\n\n\"In general, they've discounted Russian interference in the election for all the obvious reasons and that has set a bad tone at the top for dealing with that threat,\" he said.\n\nPINGED: President Trump seemed to join the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates Monday in pledging not to use information that was hacked or provided by foreign adversaries to attack campaign rivals.\n\nBut the president also claimed that he never used hacked materials in 2016 -- which is not true -- seeming to undermine the pledge.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly spoke on the trail about information hacked from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign and even urged Russia -- which intelligence agencies say was behind the hacking operation -- to search out more dirt on his Democratic opponent.\n\nA reporter asked Trump about the Democratic pledge during a question-and-answer session with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Trump replied: \"Well, I never did use [it]. As you probably know, that's what the Mueller report was all about. They said, 'No collusion,'\" the Associated Press's Jill Colvin reported.\n\nHe then added: \"And I would certainly agree to that. I don't need it. All I need is the opponents that I'm looking at. I'm liking what I see.\"\n\nThe Mueller report focused on whether Trump campaign officials knowingly cooperated with Russian hacking and disinformation operations and whether the president obstructed justice -- not whether his campaign used hacked material.\n\nDemocratic candidates have all pledged not to use hacked material against opponents, but some have included caveats -- such as if the information has been vetted and reported by the media.\n\nPATCHED: Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) is pressing for more information from a voter registration software company whose systems may have been compromised by Russian hackers during in 2016, freelance reporter Kim Zetter reported for Politico.\n\nThat company, VR Systems, has consistently maintained it was never hacked, but both a 2017 indictment and the redacted version of the Mueller report describe Russian hackers installing malware on the networks of a company that fits VR's description, Zetter reported.\n\nIn a letter to the company, Wyden asks for evidence backing up VR's claim that it wasn't breached.\n\n\"The company told Politico that in 2017, after The Intercept published an NSA document that suggested it had been targeted by the Russian hackers, it engaged top security firm FireEye to conduct a forensic examination of its own systems and network,\" Zetter reported.\n\n\"Based on analysis by FireEye, there was never an intrusion in our EVID servers or network,\" Ben Martin, chief operating officer for VR Systems, told Politico. \"We disagree with the Special Counsel report because top cyber security experts, along with the Department of Homeland Security, have tested our network multiple times since 2016 and they found no indication of a breach or installation of malware on our company network.\"\n\nThe company \"declined to provide a copy of that report or an executive summary of the findings to Politico,\" Zetter reported.\n\nPWNED: A hacking tool that was likely created by the Israeli spyware firm NSO group compromised numerous WhatsApp users - without the users downloading any malware, the Associated Press's Frank Bajak and Raphael Satter reported.\n\nThe Financial Times attributed the spyware to NSO group and a WhatsApp official made a point of not refuting that attribution, Bajak and Satter reported.\n\n\"The malware was able to penetrate phones through missed calls alone via the app's voice calling function, the spokesman said. An unknown number of people -- an amount in the dozens at least would not be inaccurate -- were infected with the malware, which the company discovered in early May,\" Bajak and Satter reported.\n\nWhatsApp put out a patch that fixes the issue soon after they discovered it.\n\nMilitary attorneys prosecuting a Navy SEAL charged with killing an Islamic State prisoner in Iraq in 2017 \"installed tracking software in emails sent to defense lawyers and a reporter in an attempt to discover who was leaking information to the news media,\" the Associated Press's Brian Melley reported, citing lawyers who said they received the corrupted messages.\n\n\"The defense attorneys said the intrusion may have violated constitutional protections against illegal searches, guarantees of lawyer-client privilege and freedom of the press, and may constitute prosecutorial misconduct,\" Melley reported.\n\nDefense attorneys for the SEAL, Andrew Gallagher, are asking a judge to force prosecutors to reveal who authorized the surveillance operation, Melley reported.

(Andy Wong/AP) By Josh Rogin Josh Rogin Columnist covering foreign policy and national security Columnist May 14 at 6:00 AM\n\nLots of countries hire Washington lobbyists and lawyers, even adversaries, but China and its state-directed corporations are stepping up their campaign to buy up parts of the swamp. In Congress, there's an effort to stop that, especially when it comes to China hiring former top national security officials to use them against the United States.\n\nThe case of former Obama administration cybersecurity official Samir Jain has sparked a reaction from lawmakers who see his new gig as a lobbyist for Huawei as problematic. After the news broke last month that Jain, who served as National Security Council senior director for cybersecurity policy in the Obama White House, had registered as a Huawei lobbyist, President Trump tweeted: \"This is not good, or acceptable!\"\n\nBut the president didn't explain why Jain working for Huawei was bad. Lawmakers want to put new rules in place to restrict adversary countries -- like China -- from gaining access to sensitive U.S. national security information by hiring former officials.\n\n\"In recent years, the Chinese Communist Party has increasingly turned to the swamp to advance its hostile agenda,\" Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) told me. \"We must do all we can to prevent senior government officials from shopping their connections on behalf of foreign adversaries. ... There is a clear need for broader action.\"\n\nLast month, Gallagher introduced the Congressional and Executive Foreign Lobbying Ban Act, which would prohibit former members of Congress, retired senior military officers and former senior political appointees from lobbying for foreign governments. Gallagher wrote to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray last month to inquire about Jain's security clearance status, since he is now working for Huawei.\n\n\"Mr. Jain's seniority and intimate knowledge of U.S. cyber security policy are now in the service of a state-directed company that according to recent reports has received funding from the National Security Commission of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army, and Chinese intelligence services,\" he wrote. \"I am deeply concerned that his current employment may jeopardize American national security and undermine efforts by the United States to rally the international community against threats posed by Huawei.\"\n\nThe FBI declined to comment on the status of Jain's security clearances but pointed me to Wray's January news conference announcing the indictments of Huawei and its chief financial officer Wanzhou Meng on charges of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran and stealing U.S. technology secrets. Wray said giving information to Huawei risks giving it to the Chinese government.\n\n\"It is public record that under Chinese cybersecurity law, Chinese companies like Huawei are required to provide, essentially, access upon demand with little to no process to challenge that,\" Wray said. \"And so that's why it creates the national security implications we are concerned about.\"\n\nCongress responded to those concerns by restricting the U.S. military's use of Huawei equipment in last year's National Defense Authorization Act. Huawei responded by suing the U.S. government, using the U.S. federal court system. That's the case Huawei has now hired Jain to lobby on, according to public disclosure filings.\n\nJain's firm, Jones Day, has represented the Chinese Embassy in the past. According to the company's website, the law firm's close relationship with the Chinese government was established by former partner Herb Hansell and continued at least until Hansell's death in 2015. Jones Day and Jain declined to comment for this story.\n\nAs the Center for Responsive Politics reported, Jain's contract is just one part of a seven-figure Huawei lobbying and public relations campaign. Jones Day registered under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which requires less reporting and therefore provides less transparency than registering under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).\n\nTwo public relations firms that Huawei also hired, Racepoint Global and Burson Cohn and Wolfe (BCW), registered under FARA, which is required for anyone working principally on behalf of a foreign government or its agent. The question of Huawei's connections to the Chinese government is hotly debated, but the public relations firms decided to err on the safe side, saying Huawei hasn't provided proof of its independence.\n\nHuawei claims to be a private, independent, employee-owned corporation, but there's significant evidence that's not the case. A recent research paper sought to demystify Huawei's opaque ownership structure. Regardless, the U.S. intelligence community believes Huawei is at the very least beholden to the direction of China's national security state and at worst an arm of it.\n\nThe reason Chinese companies such as Huawei need more oversight and restriction is because they present a broader threat to U.S. economic and national security than companies from other countries. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission released a new report last week detailing how Chinese companies facilitate the transfer of sensitive technologies from U.S. firms through legal and illegal means.\n\n\"Although Chinese companies are not the only foreign firms seeking to acquire U.S. technology, the Chinese case is unique because the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has prioritized technology transfer as a matter of policy and provides direct and indirect support to companies engaging in these anticompetitive activities,\" the report states.\n\nLaws must evolve to match evolving threats. A top national security official with senior and in-depth knowledge of our government and its vulnerabilities should not be allowed to get paid to help a foreign power that is actively working to exploit those vulnerabilities. It's not illegal to help China weaken U.S. national security, but it should be.\n\nThe Post's View: U.S. allies should heed the warnings about Huawei\n\nTom Cotton and John Cornyn: Keep the Chinese government away from 5G technology\n\nThe Post's View: The Huawei indictment tells a story of deceit and corporate espionage\n\nJosh Rogin: Huawei's charm offensive won't work\n\nJohn Pomfret: A deeper tech concern is at the core of the U.S.-Huawei spat", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/karYpdmxHnzXjQnUm_H1W5lsWRc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RMGBDCRYBYI6TA3V4POPNNUFLA.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4786358", "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 295526220}, {"uri": "1135420974", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-14", "time": "05:15:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-14T05:15:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5568627715110779, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/14/why-us-allies-arent-rushing-back-trumps-china-trade-war/", "title": "Analysis | Why U.S. allies aren't rushing to back Trump's China trade war", "body": "By Adam Taylor Adam Taylor Foreign reporter who writes about a variety of subjects May 14 at 12:59 AM\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know? Sign up for the Today's WorldView newsletter.\n\n(Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nEven by Trump administration standards, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is a controversial White House guest. He is widely regarded as an autocrat in Europe; presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama had pointedly avoided hosting him.\n\nBut it's Trump's Washington now. And with the Dow Jones industrial average tanking on Monday by more than 600 points amid a fresh round of tit-for-tat tariffs in the U.S.-China trade war, the president welcomed Orban to the White House -- perhaps less worried about his illiberal policies and more about finding an ally in the battle against Beijing.\n\nKen Weinstein, president of the conservative Hudson Institute think tank, suggested to Politico that China was the most pressing reason for Orban's visit, saying the subtext of the trip was \"likely China, on Orb\u00e1n's relations with the Chinese and trying to get greater cooperation on this issue.\"\n\nYet despite some signs of personal affinity, Orban is likely to disappoint Trump on China. Under his leadership, Hungary has grown close to Beijing in recent years, part of a turn away from the West that has also seen the nation build ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Orban opened up the country to telecom giant Huawei Technologies and was the first European Union leader to express support for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Chinese President Xi Jinping's massive international infrastructure investment that is frequently criticized in Washington.\n\nJust last month, Orban visited Beijing, where Chinese state media reported that he said BRI was \"an opportunity rather than a threat.\"\n\nShouldn't Orban be lining up with Trump on China? Hungary is a NATO ally, and the tough-talking prime minister was an early supporter of Trump's presidential campaign. He has aligned with Trump on a host of controversial international issues, including immigration and religion.\n\nMeanwhile, China's unfair trade policies, egregious human rights abuses and worrying geopolitical ambitions pose a problem for countries all over the world. The United States is also the larger economic power, and most experts say Washington can inflict far more pain on the Chinese economy than Beijing can deal to the U.S. economy in retaliation.\n\nBut instead, Orban looks like he is sitting on the fence.\n\nThe truth is, Hungary is far from the only U.S. ally to try to avoid picking sides in the trade war. And it's not too hard to see why when you consider how much other countries have to lose. Americans are worried about this week's stock market tumble, but that outlook is far worse for countries that aren't an economic behemoth like the United States.\n\nSome nations are particularly hesitant to move away from the Chinese economic links they've established in the last few years. Huawei, the telecommunications firm at the center of American anxiety about Chinese influence in Hungary, is an excellent case in point.\n\nWashington may warn of security risks, but low-cost technology from Huawei is already in place for numerous U.S. allies; removing it ahead of upgrades to 5G networks would be prohibitively expensive for many countries, and the United States would do little to make up for the cost.\n\nThere is some serious collateral damage from Trump's tariffs, too. Some targeting Beijing, such as those on steel and aluminum imports based on \"national security,\" have also significantly hit U.S. allies. Rather than rallying potential allies to the China fight, Trump's unilateral trade actions are punishing them, too.\n\nIf the trade war intensifies, they might end up stuck between Washington and Beijing. Canada already found that out the hard way after it arrested Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on an American warrant in December. The impact wasn't just financial: Two Canadian citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, have been detained in China since the end of last year on deeply dubious charges.\n\nThe Trump administration loves to talk tough on trade and foreign policy. Over-the-top, arguably xenophobic language against China by Trump allies and surrogates may have pushed some allies away, especially as the administration veers close to conflict in Iran, Venezuela and North Korea.\n\nBut it's not just the Trump administration's hawkish leanings that may worry allies. It's also its unpredictably dovish ones. Only a week ago, most of the world expected Trump, a lover of signing deals, to accept a watered-down agreement from China. Now the trade war is back and bigger than ever.\n\nTrump's apparent U-turn seems to have been motivated largely by China's slow-rolling of negotiations. But some pundits also believe that Trump is positioning himself for the 2020 presidential election, when he believes that China could become a major issue in the battle against a Democratic challenger. Could Trump back down again, should the economy take a harder hit or the political calculation change in another way?\n\nIn that scenario, Beijing's relations with Washington might improve, but its smaller allies might remain exposed (see here: Canada). Even if Trump keeps a hard line on China, he might fail to win a second term. It is unclear who would replace him and what their China policy might be.\n\nThis unpredictability may help in hard bilateral negotiations, but it doesn't exactly foster alliances. Given the circumstances, it's not surprising that weaker allies are staying out of the fray. Writing from Australia over the weekend, the New York Times's Neil Irwin noted that the \"bifurcating world trade system has created new urgency in trying to keep options on both sides.\"\n\nFor a small country like Hungary -- \"fragile and threatened\" due to its size, as Orban puts it -- the best option may be to not pick sides, but to wait and see what he can extract from both parties in a bidding war. This week, he got a White House meeting with Trump ahead of upcoming European Parliament elections. Not too shabby.\n\nOf course, this Hungary first policy is at odds with U.S. interests, but who can blame Orban? Even Trump himself probably appreciates the chutzpah. The Hungarian prime minister is\"probably, like me, a little bit controversial,\" Trump told reporters in the White House on Monday. \"But that's okay.\"\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

Probably like me a little bit controversial, but that's okay.\"\n\nTrump said the two would discuss trade and shared NATO concerns, but he did not publicly mention Hungary's slide into authoritarianism, its human rights and free speech abuses or growing anti-Semitism.\n\nA smile played around Orban's lips as he watched the chaotic scene of reporters jostling and shouting questions amid a phalanx of photographers angling for position.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Orban thanked Trump for the invitation and noted the two-decade interval since his last trip to see a U.S. president. He said he and Trump have \"similar approaches\" to many global issues.\n\n\"We are proud to stand together with the United States on fighting against illegal migration, on terrorism, and to protect and help the Christian communities all around the world,\" Orban said.\n\nTrump responded in kind.\n\n\"You have been great with respect to Christian communities,\" he said. \"You have really put a block up, and we appreciate that very much.\"\n\nIn office for nine years this time and once before for four, Orban has morphed from a crusading anti-Soviet reformer embraced by President Bill Clinton to an increasingly autocratic figure who has erected a fence along his country's southern border to keep out migrants and asylum seekers.\n\nThe Oval Office invitation is a coup for Orban, who has shrugged off his outcast status in Europe but is seeking a measure of rehabilitation ahead of elections to the European Parliament next month.\n\nThe Trump administration has largely shrugged off Orban's anti-democratic actions and said that the invitation is less an embrace of a like-minded figure and more about heading off Orban's drift toward U.S. competitors Russia and China.\n\nThe invitation was somewhat slow in coming, at least by Trump standards. Orban is the last Central European leader to get the nod, although he was the first foreign leader to endorse then-candidate Trump, in 2016.\n\nFormer Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon once admiringly said that Orban was \"Trump before Trump.\"\n\nOrban, 55, is the latest in a list of strongmen to get the one-on-one treatment at the White House. Other recent examples include the right-wing or autocratic leaders of Poland, Egypt, Brazil and Austria.\n\n\"It still remains rightly shocking to see Trump cozy up to authoritarian leaders,\" said Amanda Sloat, a former State Department official who is now at the Brookings Institution. \"The American president should be supporting democratic allies with shared values rather than autocrats who are actively undermining U.S. interests.\"\n\n[Hungary evicts prestigious US-Hungarian university founded by George Soros]\n\nTrump's ambassador to Hungary, New York financier and Trump friend David Cornstein, told The Atlantic recently that Trump \"would love to have the situation that Viktor Orban has, but he doesn't.\"\n\nA senior administration official told reporters Friday that Cornstein's remark may have been \"taken out of context\" but did not offer detail on what the ambassador meant.\n\nCornstein also told the magazine that he did not expect that Orban's targeting of an American university in Budapest founded by liberal Hungarian American donor George Soros would have much effect on U.S. relations with Hungary.\n\n\"I'm hopeful we can turn the page and move on to other subjects,\" he said.\n\nOrban has used familiar and veiled anti-Semitic references in attacking Soros as a \"crafty\" interloper who uses money to meddle in the country's affairs, and he has sought to link Soros with Muslim and other migrants Orban says would overrun the country.\n\nCountries that accept Syrian and other migrants are creating \"mixed-race nations\" and putting their history and traditions at risk, Orban said in a speech in February.\n\nHis political party was suspended from the right-wing People's Party, its perch in the European Parliament, over its anti-democratic actions.\n\nA bipartisan letter Friday from four members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee rued \"Hungary's downward democratic trajectory and the implications for U.S. interests in Central Europe.\"\n\nCommittee Chairman James E. Risch (R-Idaho), a Trump ally, was among the signers.\n\n\"We remain profoundly concerned about the close relationship between this NATO partner and Moscow,\" the letter said.\n\nBriefing reporters ahead of the visit, two Trump administration officials said the United States has put its concerns about the university, anti-Semitism and migration issues directly to Orban in other meetings, including lengthy discussions with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThe officials said the visit is part of a broader outreach to Central and Eastern Europe, rather than a personal reward for Orban.\n\nMain items on the agenda included U.S. concerns about European expansion of Chinese tech firm Huawei, European energy security and the potential for increased weapons sales to Hungary, the officials said.\n\n\"The point of this meeting is simply just to reinforce the strategic relationship between allies, NATO allies of U.S. and Hungary,\" one official said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the session, \"not necessarily just thrash out every issue on the bilateral agenda, which we have been doing constantly for the last two years.\"\n\nTrump didn't seem interested in thrashing out any contentious issues with Orban -- at least not publicly.\n\nToward the end of the Oval Office question-and-answer session, Trump was asked whether he is concerned about \"democratic backsliding\" in Hungary.\n\n\"Well, people have a lot of respect for this prime minister,\" Trump replied. \"He's a respected man. I know he's a tough man, but he's a respected man, and he's done the right thing, according to many people, on immigration.\"\n\nIn other settings, Trump has been harshly critical of more liberal immigration policies in Western Europe, especially in Germany and France.\n\n\"And you look at some of the problems that they have in Europe that are tremendous because they've done it a different way than the prime minister,\" Trump said Monday.\n\nTrump then invited Orban to say his piece.\n\n\"From the people, by the people, for the people,\" Orban replied, his tone clipped. \"This is the basis for the Hungarian government, so it's a government which is elected by the Hungarian people several times,\" Orban said. \"So we are happy to serve our nation.\"\n\nIndependent election monitors have found that Hungarian elections have become less free, and the Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe was critical of the Orban government's propaganda campaign during the most recent election in 2018.\n\n\"Fundamental rights and freedoms were respected overall, but exercised in an adverse climate,\" OSCE monitors wrote.\n\nTrump, wagging his index finger, closed off further discussion of Hungarian democracy by noting that the country is \"a very good member of NATO, and I don't think we can go into too much of a discussion unless that's mentioned.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WKzscLFKhJun2VjpZX7E1AtZ2tM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DL6KAITVWEI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4784047", "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 295489380}, {"uri": "1135284262", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-14", "time": "00:13:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-14T00:13:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/05/13/us/politics/ap-us-united-states-hungary.html", "title": "Trump Meets Hungary's Far-Right Prime Minister", "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has never shied away from rubbing shoulders with leaders more typically kept at a distance by the West, and his Oval Office meeting Monday with Hungary's far right-leaning prime minister was only the latest example of his engagement with strongmen.\n\nLike Trump, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has espoused hard-line anti-migration rhetoric. The president described his guest this way: \"Probably, like me, a little bit controversial, but that's OK. That's OK. You've done a good job and you've kept your country safe.\"\n\nTrump's presidency has been marked by decisions that strain longtime U.S. alliances. He has refused to be confined to engaging only with traditional power players in the West. Orban has been accused of dismantling democratic institutions in his country.\n\nA top Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, called the meeting with Orban \"a betrayal to American values abroad\" and said Trump \"clearly has a dangerous affinity for authoritarian figures over our democratic allies.\"\n\nOrban was the latest central European leader to get a meeting with Trump, who wants to curry their favor and discourage them from moving closer to China and Russia.\n\nOrban said he was proud to stand with Trump in the \"fight against illegal migration, on terrorism and protecting the Christian communities all around the world.\"\n\nAsked about democratic backsliding in Hungary, Trump called Orban \"a tough man,\" but added that he's \"a respected man,\" too.\n\n\"He's done the right thing, according to many people on immigration,\" Trump said. \"You look at some of the problems they have in Europe that are tremendous, because they've done it in a different way than the prime minister.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch and Human Rights First both said, however, that Orban has not only assaulted the rule of law and basic human rights in Hungary, but has \"employed anti-migrant, anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic and xenophobic rhetoric while targeting civil society organizations and universities receiving funding from overseas.\"\n\nThe White House said the two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to NATO and democratic systems of government. They also discussed how best to increase vigilance against unchecked global migration and to address China's unfair trade and investment practices.\n\nOrban's was the first visit of a Hungarian prime minister to the Oval Office since 2005.\n\nOrban faced years of harsh criticism from the Obama administration over his weakening of democratic checks and balances. U.S.-Hungary relations have improved in recent months, partly because of Hungarian plans to purchase medium-range missiles from U.S. sources to improve the country's air defense system.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, has warned Hungary that \"an authoritarian Russia will never be a friend to the freedom and sovereignty of smaller nations.\" Pompeo also has emphasized the risks of doing business with Chinese telecommunications company Huawei, which has significant operations in Hungary, and said there are dangers to allowing \"China to gain a bridgehead in Hungary.\"\n\nThe Republican chairman and the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee wrote Trump a letter Friday, saying that \"democracy in Hungary has significantly eroded.\" Sens. James Risch, R-Idaho, and Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said that under Orban, elections have become less competitive, the judiciary is increasingly controlled by the state and press freedom has declined.\n\nThe letter, also signed by Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., complained that Hungary has failed to diversify its energy resources away from Russia and has allowed Moscow to exploit its visa system to evade U.S. sanctions. Late last year, the State Department said Hungary denied a U.S. request to extradite two suspected Russian arms dealers and sent the men to Russia instead.\n\n\"I hope that in the private conversation Trump will tell him that we don't like Orban sliding into the Russian sphere of influence,\" said Andras Simonyi, a former Hungarian ambassador to the U.S. who is now affiliated with George Washington University in Washington. \"I am not sure he will, but if he does, the visit was totally worth it. Otherwise it was a waste of the president's time.\"\n\nOrban is not the only hard-liner Trump has engaged with.\n\nTrump didn't hesitate to meet -- twice now -- with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in an effort to persuade him to give up his nuclear weapons program.\n\nHe has praised Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, which interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump also remains allied with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is under pressure over the killing of a Saudi activist who lived in the United States and wrote articles criticizing the kingdom.\n\nIn 2017, Trump met in Manila with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has attacked U.S. security policies and launched a crackdown on illegal drugs that has claimed the lives of thousands of mostly poor drug suspects. Duterte has sought Chinese infrastructure funding, trade and investment, has reached out to Russia and has threatened to end the presence of U.S. counterterrorism forces in the country, although that has not happened.\n\nAlso in 2017, during Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit with Trump in Washington, Erdogan's bodyguards attacked peaceful protesters gathered outside the Turkish ambassador's residence. Security officers guarding the authoritarian leader of Turkey, a member of NATO, hit and kicked the demonstrators, who wound up with injuries including concussions, broken and loose teeth, and a popped blood vessel in the eye.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Barbara Ortutay in San Francisco contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@nytimes.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "eventUri": "eng-4784047", "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 295488780}, {"uri": "1134363637", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-12", "time": "21:10:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-12T21:10:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/12/senate-has-important-work-do-why-waste-time-subpoenaing-donald-trump-jr/", "title": "Opinion | The Senate has important work to do. Why waste time subpoenaing Donald Trump Jr.?", "body": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Jan. 24 in Washington. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) By Hugh Hewitt Hugh Hewitt May 12 at 4:52 PM\n\nThere are six vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals, with two more vacancies certain to occur and many more likely to happen before January 2021 as older members of the courts eager to be replaced by center-right judges take \"senior status.\" Each is nearly as important to preserving liberty, individual rights and the rule of law as a Supreme Court vacancy, though many outside the legal community don't understand this.\n\nThere are 48 nominees for district-court positions awaiting action by the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Senate as a whole. Another 12 nominees are waiting offstage. Increasingly, judges at this level of the judiciary are claiming the right to dictate national policy by way of injunctions binding the entire country, rather than only the district to which they were appointed.\n\nMost pressing are the vacancies on the often-overruled U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, and the 2nd Circuit has two vacancies that, when nominees are selected and confirmed, will flip that circuit's composition to a majority of Republican presidents' nominees.\n\nIt is a measure of President Trump's disdain for the long-rumored assault on his companies or family from the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York that he allowed the process of filling other vacancies on the 2nd Circuit to drag on for months, decisive as that court might be for appeals for politicized rulings against his interests. A fair conclusion is that the president doesn't think he's in legal peril. He never believed it about what he called \"the Russia hoax,\" and if he believed he was vulnerable in a jurisdiction answering to the 2nd Circuit, he would have put a spark under his judge-picking team long ago. But his confidence ought not to delay filling the vacancies.\n\nThese judicial nominees are the Senate's most important task, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) have patiently and persistently worked to address the backlog and change rules to allow the federal bench to be as populated as quickly as the White House allows, given the glacial pace of new nominees.\n\nThe Senate has other urgent business. The Finance Committee is about to take up crucial retirement-savings reforms that could impact tens of millions of Americans annually. That effort could creatively address the housing needs of seniors by allowing them to use tax-sheltered savings to pay off mortgages or secure senior living arrangements without triggering taxable events. That same committee and others have work to do on the soaring costs of some prescription drugs and on infrastructure, as well as the annual battle to adequately fund the military. The Senate Intelligence Committee must work with the executive branch to persuasively educate our allies -- Britain, primarily -- and the American public on the threats that Chinese telecommunications giants Huawei and ZTE pose to security global networks.\n\nYet that committee, charged with oversight of the intelligence community and thus with countless urgent issues and tasks, deemed it necessary to subpoena Donald Trump Jr. as a sort of final ritual in the opera of collusion delusion that has gripped the country since the 2016 presidential election. We need to know if this latest subpoena is simply a flexing of muscles by staff frustrated by years of fruitless digging that was rendered obviously irrelevant by the work of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and his conclusion that no conspiracy occurred between Russia and Donald Trump, his family or his campaign team.\n\nThe subpoena is a maddening coda especially for those who urged that the administration cooperate with the special counsel and that Mueller not be fired or in any way impeded. (Mueller wasn't. In fact, all the dense blocks of innuendo-filled prose in Part II of the Mueller report could not obscure that the president cooperated to an unparalleled degree with the special counsel.)\n\nWith all this real work to be done and military and national security matters to be superintended, Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and a majority of his committee colleagues still felt that one more whack at Donald Trump Jr. was necessary.\n\nIt isn't. No matter what the committee tells itself. Outside of #resistance cable television pundits and Bizarro Twitter, \"no collusion/no obstruction\" is the verdict that was rendered by the attorney general and accepted by the public, a verdict that the Senate GOP especially should know it ignores at the peril of its majority in 2021.\n\nHarry Litman: Trump Jr. is going by the family playbook.

May 12 at 8:50 AM\n\nPresident Trump ran for office vowing to extricate the United States from entanglements abroad. But his administration now finds itself juggling three national security crises overseas -- with Iran, Venezuela and North Korea -- while confronting China over a possible trade war.\n\nThe situation, partly a function of uncontrollable events, is also the result of Trump's \"go big or go home\" approach to foreign affairs, which has led his administration to apply \"maximum pressure\" to multiple nations simultaneously, rather than prioritize one over the other or take incremental steps.\n\nThe maximalist tactics at times have raised the prospect of big breakthroughs, ones that Trump hopes to take to the campaign trail for his reelection, particularly when it comes to North Korea.\n\nAt the same time, it has brought what former policymakers describe as a greater risk of crises and miscalculations, as well as possible distractions from the primary goal of the administration's national security strategy: countering Russia and China.\n\n\"The president's apparent tendency to brinkmanship brings with it a degree of danger -- and it's even more dangerous when it's combined with a pattern of bluffing,\" said James Dobbins, a former top diplomat who is now a senior fellow at the Rand Corporation.\n\nWhether Trump is willing to pursue military action, which he and his aides have referenced in public remarks, is a looming question. He has long been a vocal skeptic of American military force abroad and at times has expressed concern about the more hawkish impulses of his national security adviser, John Bolton. Strategy experts cite the risk of overextending U.S. rhetoric in conflicts with possible military outcomes if the president isn't willing to back words with actions.\n\n\"It's kind of like the not terribly capable bully, who likes pushing people around and teasing them, but when push comes to shove, is nervous to actually get into a bar fight,\" said Mara Karlin, a former Pentagon strategist during the Obama administration and a professor at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nTrump administration officials dispute that the president is engaging in any reckless brinkmanship. They point out that Trump and his top advisers primarily voice Washington's desire for peaceful resolutions to the confrontations in North Korea, Iran and Venezuela, and note that he has reinvigorated the diplomatic track with Pyongyang, brokering the suspension of menacing intercontinental ballistic missile tests. This past week, Trump extended an olive branch to Iran, \"saying I'd like to see them call me,\" even as his top aides lambasted the country and the U.S. military said it would respond to any attack on American interests with unrelenting force.\n\n\"The administration continues to leverage diplomacy, pursue economic pressure, and enforce existing laws to deter malign actors seeking to threaten stability and security,\" a senior administration official said in a statement. \"The United States, though, remains prepared to respond to any threats against America or our allies.\"\n\nThe official defended the efficacy and rationale of the administration's approach. \"The United States is responding to legitimate threats against America and our allies and partners with highly effective maximum pressure campaigns,\" the official said.\n\nThe possibility that Trump's resolve could be tested has increased in recent days.\n\nIn Asia, progress in talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un showed signs of backsliding, as the United States seized a North Korean vessel allegedly used for evading sanctions and suspended efforts to recover remains of American military personnel killed during the Korean War. Pyongyang, for its part, carried out new short-range missile tests, raising the possibility of a return to intercontinental ballistic missile testing it suspended after talks with Trump.\n\nIn South America, top administration officials suggested the possibility of military action against Venezuela after a failed insurrection by the U.S.-backed opposition took officials in Washington off guard. The U.S. military sent a hospital ship to the nation's coast in between preparing for contingencies should Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government fall.\n\nPerhaps the most concerning developments arose out of the Middle East. A year after Trump pulled out of the Iranian nuclear accord, Tehran announced that it would stop complying with some elements of the agreement, promising to enrich uranium to a higher level than allowed under the treaty. The decision once again raising the threat of nuclear proliferation in one of the most unstable parts of the world.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon dispatched a carrier strike group, a bomber force and a Patriot missile battery to the Middle East after receiving intelligence suggesting that Iran could be preparing an attack against U.S. troops or interests in the region.\n\nAs the crises with North Korea, Venezuela and Iran unfold, one risk is that the Trump administration will lose focus on a national security strategy that calls for concentrating primarily on countering Russia and China.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump's top national security officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Bolton, have spent most of their public messaging time talking about those three situations rather than about longer-term threats.\n\nJames Carafano, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation, said he didn't see the developments as a drift away from the strategy, but rather as inevitable confrontations, noting that the strategy shift was less about abandoning them and more about lessening focus on transnational terrorism.\n\n\"A big part of Venezuela is the U.S. showing the Russians and the Chinese it's going to maintain dominance in the Western Hemisphere,\" he said. \"Iran is always part of the mix because it's the chief destabilizer in the Middle East. And North Korea directly threatened the United States.\"\n\nA senior State Department official said dealing with these brewing crises hasn't taken away from the Trump administration's focus on Beijing and Moscow.\n\nThe United States has tried to curb the expansion of Chinese firms such as Huawei and China Mobile, albeit with mixed success. Washington has called out the alleged mistreatment of China's Muslim minority population and blocked certain Chinese investments.\n\nThe State Department official noted the wide array of sanctions against Russia for interfering in the 2016 election, poisoning a former Russian spy in Britain and intervening in Ukraine, though the punishments largely came at the urging of Congress. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss administration strategy.\n\nThe Trump administration has worked relatively closely with allies on its approach to Venezuela, but it has broken with allies in Europe over Iran and at times has clashed with South Korea over how to handle talks with the Kim regime.\n\n\"The world is changing, and the United States' ability to manage things in the way it used to, believing we had the wisdom and the foresight and the resources to tackle all things simultaneously, and other countries were inclined to go along, that's definitely changed,\" said Chris Preble, vice president for foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of confrontations with North Korea, Venezuela and Iran, Trump has also been applying economic pressure to China, most recently hiking U.S. tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods.\n\nApart from a high-profile strike on Syrian leader Bashar al Assad's air force in 2017 over chemical weapons use, and the continuation of operations in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, Trump has largely been skeptical of taking new military actions. With China, however, he has demonstrated a comfort with employing blunt economic force.\n\n\"The one source of some comfort is that Trump does seem to be risk averse when it comes to military action, and I'm sure the U.S. military are reinforcing him in that regard,\" Dobbins said. \"The more dangerous of these situations in the short to medium term is probably the Chinese one, since that's an area where he has been less risk averse.\"\n\nCarol Morello contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RLA-45unt18tKf6LotFBCsMV3pA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J3POHVDUWUI6TM7VKZZ634WRE4.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4778052", "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 295362420}, {"uri": "1134052063", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-12", "time": "09:54:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-12T09:54:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8039215803146362, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/world/europe/orban-trump-hungary-white-house.html", "title": "Trump Tries to Bring Hungary's Orban in From the Cold", "body": "BUDAPEST -- George W. Bush dodged it. Barack Obama refused it. But on Monday President Trump will grant Viktor Orban, Hungary's far-right prime minister, his first private audience with a president at the White House since he met Bill Clinton there in 1998.\n\nBack then, Mr. Orban was a young centrist who praised Mr. Clinton for helping Hungary to escape Russian influence by joining NATO, but today he is a doyen of right-wing nationalists on multiple continents. He has enfeebled democratic institutions, strived to achieve a Hungarian ethnic homogeneity and pulled his nation closer to the opponents of American influence, Russia and China.\n\nHis welcome at the White House is seen by Mr. Trump's critics as emblematic of the president's preference for strongman leaders who seek to undermine the liberal international order.\n\n\"This visit is par for the course in terms of this administration's interest in aligning itself with autocrats and would-be autocrats,\" said Robert G. Berschinski, a former deputy assistant secretary of state under Mr. Obama, now a senior vice president at Human Rights First, a watchdog group.\n\nBut Mr. Orban's invitation to the White House reflects a more complex knot of considerations than just a shared political outlook, analysts and diplomats said. An Oval Office meeting is one of the highest honors an American president can give an ally, and this one has been slow in coming.\n\nThe Hungarian prime minister is in fact the last leader in Central Europe to be invited to the White House under Mr. Trump, even though Mr. Orban was, in July 2016, the first foreign leader to endorse Mr. Trump's candidacy for the presidency.\n\nAnd the day after Mr. Orban's visit, State Department officials will meet in Washington with a pair of center-right opposition politicians from Hungary who beat Mr. Orban's party in two recent by-elections.\n\n\"This was much more difficult for Orban to get than people think,\" said Andras Simonyi, a former Hungarian ambassador to the United States and NATO who now works as an academic in Washington.\n\n\"This silly idea that there is this unity between Trump and Orban is nonsense -- Orban has been wanting this visit for two and a half years,\" Mr. Simonyi added. \"It's embarrassing for Orban.\"\n\nRather than a reward or an affirmation, the meeting can instead be framed as a carrot -- an attempt to persuade Mr. Orban to buy American weapons and give greater priority to American foreign policy interests.\n\nThough Mr. Trump has often spoken warmly of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, some of Mr. Trump's most senior advisers, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have expressed concerns about the influence Russia and China wield in Hungary and other Central European countries.\n\nA bipartisan group of senators, including the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, James E. Risch, wrote to the president on Friday to warn of Hungary's \"downward democratic trajectory and the implications for U.S. interests in Central Europe.\"\n\nMr. Orban's lawmakers have granted a form of diplomatic immunity to an obscure Russian bank with connections to the Kremlin, a decision that American officials fear will allow the bank to act as a hub for Russian spies in Europe. And his administration gave residency documents to a Russian lawmaker, as well as relatives of the head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service.\n\nWhen two arms dealers were captured in Hungary, following an investigation by American law enforcement officials, Mr. Orban's government angered their American counterparts by extraditing the dealers to Russia instead of the United States.\n\nAmerican officials are also keen to discourage the Orban government from allowing the Chinese firm Huawei to build the local infrastructure for 5G wireless internet.\n\n\"This is more about long-term American strategic interests than about rewarding or not rewarding Orban, even if it looks otherwise,\" Mr. Simonyi, the former ambassador, said.\n\nSensitive to the perception of embracing another illiberal autocrat, administration officials insisted during a conference call with reporters on Friday that the government has raised concerns about Mr. Orban's actions at lower levels.\n\nMr. Orban met at the White House with Vice President Dick Cheney in 2001 but was refused a formal Oval Office meeting with Mr. Bush in 2002, shortly before he lost power to the Hungarian socialist party. His successor, Ferenc Gyurcsany, was granted a White House visit with Mr. Bush in 2005. After Mr. Orban re-entered office in 2010 and began to subjugate the judiciary, take over the news media and gerrymander the electoral map, Mr. Orban was snubbed repeatedly by the Obama administration.\n\nWithout question, the Trump administration has been warmer to Mr. Orban, who shares with Mr. Trump a dislike of immigration, independent institutions that can check his power, and international institutions that they say undermine national sovereignty.\n\nThat outward comity stands in contrast to the obvious friction between the Trump administration and longstanding American allies in Europe and elsewhere. Last Tuesday, Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State, canceled a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany with only a few hours of notice and instead made a quick trip to Iraq -- a decision perceived in Germany as a snub. He announced the same day that he would meet this week with Mr. Putin in Russia.\n\nLast June, Mr. Orban was granted a phone call with Mr. Trump. In July, the State Department canceled funding for independent Hungarian news outlets that threatened to loosen Mr. Orban's grip on the Hungarian news media.\n\nTo head the State Department section on European affairs, Mr. Trump in 2017 named A. Wess Mitchell, an advocate of friendlier ties with European Union nations, like Hungary and Poland, whose governments oppose the liberal forces that hold sway within the European Union. But Mr. Mitchell resigned this year and is due to be replaced by a career diplomat, Philip T. Reeker, who has displayed no public affection for the Orban administration.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump's apparent affinity for the likes of Mr. Orban owes something to his envy of leaders who are rarely challenged at home.\n\n\"I can tell you, knowing the president for a good 25 or 30 years, that he would love to have the situation that Viktor Orban has, but he doesn't,\" David Cornstein, Mr. Trump's ambassador to Hungary, said in an interview published in The Atlantic on Thursday.\n\nDespite the Trump administration's greater engagement with Hungary, Mr. Orban has not responded with much good will of his own.\n\nHe has blocked high-level cooperation between Ukraine and NATO, and ignored American requests to stall the expulsion of the Central European University, an American college in Budapest whose continued presence in Hungary was a stated foreign policy goal of the Trump administration.\n\nMr. Orban also took months to agree to a new defense cooperation agreement with the United States which, though finally signed in April, has yet to be ratified by the Hungarian Parliament, which he largely controls.\n\nMr. Berschinski, the former State Department official, said that an Oval Office meeting was likely to have little effect on Hungarian policy, and some current officials at the department say privately that they agree.\n\n\"Viktor Orban is joining an increasingly long line of leaders -- from Vladimir Putin to Mohammed bin Salman to Rodrigo Duterte to Abdel Fattah el-Sisi -- that President Trump will say positive things about without getting much in return,\" Mr. Berschinski said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_novak@nytimes.com", "name": "Benjamin Novak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/12/world/12orban/12orban-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4784047", "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 295350840}, {"uri": "1133687142", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-11", "time": "17:22:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-11T17:22:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/world/asia/us-china-trade-war.html", "title": "Trade Standoff May Be Initial Skirmish in Broader U.S.-China Economic War", "body": "WASHINGTON -- A yearlong trade war between the United States and China is proving to be an initial skirmish in an economic conflict that may persist for decades, as both countries battle for global dominance, stature and wealth.\n\nProgress toward a trade agreement nearly collapsed this past week, with both sides hardening their bargaining positions. And even if a trade deal is reached, it may do little to resolve tensions between the world's two largest economies.\n\nThe United States is increasingly wary of China's emerging role in the global economy and the tactics it uses to get ahead, including state-sponsored hacking, acquisitions of high-tech companies in the United States and Europe, subsidies to crucial industries and discrimination against foreign companies.\n\nThe Trump administration has begun trying to limit China's economic influence in the United States and abroad, warning about China's ambitions in increasingly stark terms. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, compared China's ambitions to Russia and Iran in a speech in London last Wednesday, saying Beijing poses \"a new kind of challenge; an authoritarian regime that's integrated economically into the West in ways that the Soviet Union never was.\"\n\nThe United States has been erecting barriers to limit Chinese investment in American companies, re-examining the kinds of technology that can be exported to China and restricting China's role in building America's next-generation telecommunications networks, while also discouraging other countries from using Chinese equipment.\n\nThe F.B.I. has increased its scrutiny of Chinese researchers in the United States over fears they may be acquiring intellectual secrets. A Justice Department initiative is targeting commercial espionage of American technology, and earlier this year the United States unveiled a sweeping indictment of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, over accusations of stealing trade secrets and evading American sanctions on Iran.\n\nChina, whose ambition is to dominate industries of the future, is pushing back. A column on Saturday in the Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper stated, \"The United States is again waving the club of tariffs after misjudging China's strength, capacity and will, further escalating trade friction between our two countries.\"\n\nThe piece was written under the pen name Zhong Sheng -- the \"voice of China\" -- a name used when the paper publishes comments on foreign affairs that are authoritative.\n\nRestraining China's ambitions and methods is a tricky task -- and there is concern that the Trump administration's effort is creating a new red scare, fueling discrimination against China and its citizens that could ultimately hurt the United States. As many as 30 Chinese professors have had their visas to the United States canceled in the past year, or been put on administrative review, according to Chinese academics and their American counterparts.\n\n\"We've got decades of painful negotiating with China ahead,\" said David Lampton, a China scholar at Stanford University. Mr. Lampton said a trade deal, if reached, would do little to resolve the bigger conflict. \"It's just a skirmish in an ongoing battle.\"\n\nChinese negotiators returned to Beijing over the weekend without a trade agreement and with even larger economic barriers between the two countries. The Trump administration raised tariffs on $200 billion in exports on Friday and said it would move ahead with the legal process of taxing another roughly $300 billion of products at the same 25 percent rate.\n\nThe two countries could yet come to an agreement that opens opportunities for businesses and rolls back the levies they have placed on each other. Both American and Chinese officials said on Friday that they would continue to talk and could meet in Beijing next month. Liu He, China's vice premier, called the failure to reach a deal \"just a small setback in the talks between two countries,\" while Mr. Trump, in a tweet, described the talks as \"candid and constructive.\"\n\nWhile a trade deal could calm some tensions and establish more good will between the two nations, it is unlikely to achieve many of the ambitious goals that the administration has set for itself. Mr. Trump's advisers, in particular the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, have been focused on what the administration calls China's practices of \"economic aggression.\"\n\nBut the administration has struggled to address the immensity of the problems in the text of a trade deal. People close to the talks say that the negotiators appear powerless to force any changes that aren't in China's interest.\n\nMr. Liu, who is leading China's team in the trade negotiations, hinted at that uphill battle in a video statement released by the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n\"Now both sides have reached consensus in many respects, but frankly there are also areas of disagreement,\" he said. \"We believe that these are major matters of principle, and any country has its own important principles -- we can't make concessions on matters of principle.\"\n\nDespite punishing tariffs already on nearly half of Chinese exports to the United States, Beijing is still resisting many of the most significant changes that the administration seeks. It has been reluctant to roll back subsidies for advanced manufacturing industries or to make public commitments to stop cybertheft.\n\nInstead, a trade deal between the two countries seems more likely to bring change around the margins -- tens of billions of dollars of soybean purchases, some tariffs lifted and changes to the text of Chinese laws or regulations that the country might ultimately disregard, particularly once another administration occupies the White House.\n\n\"This is a decades-long endeavor,\" said Robert Daly, the director of the Wilson Center's Kissinger Institute on China and the United States. \"This can't be waved away over cake at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nThe notion that the United States has one last shot to change China's behavior is held by an array of people on both sides of the political spectrum. But it is an aggressive notion of American power to upend a rival system that has delivered prosperity for its people and put China on course to be the world's largest economy.\n\nMany in China see the United States as a declining power bent on enforcing its will on a world that no longer cowers before its hegemonic might. The troubles in American democracy and the long economic slump after 2008 persuaded many in China that its instincts to chart its own course were correct. In the eyes of many Chinese, their country is simply reclaiming its historic status as a dominant regional power in Asia.\n\nIt has also projected power across Asia, Africa and elsewhere while the United States has, on many fronts, retreated from its post-World War II commitment to the global order. But it has done so with little application of military force, in sharp contrast to what many in China see as American militarism.\n\nMany in China have sought to avoid a trade conflict, which could have a larger impact on their economy than the United States'. But they have long thought the United States would have a difficult time accepting a true peer in economic, technology and military power, so consider the management of conflict with the United States to be an inevitable result of their own rise.\n\nWhile the Trump administration accused China of breaking a trade deal, China's resistance to the emerging terms stemmed from its belief that the United States was asking too much and offering too little in return. Many of the changes the United States seeks would limit what Chinese officials regard as a tried-and-true approach of using tens of billions of dollars from state-owned banks and government investment funds to turn previously small industries like car production or solar panel manufacturing into the largest industries of their kind in the world.\n\nAnd the Chinese view some of the Trump administration's demands as infringing on their sovereignty and giving America too much power over their economy -- including requiring it to codify changes through legislation in the National People's Congress. To the increasingly nationalistic public in China, the American requests are reminiscent of 19th century history of unequal treaties forced on the country by foreign powers.\n\nIn the United States, China's unwillingness to bow to America's demands is uniting lawmakers like the Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.\n\nThat is a significant shift from the prevailing view in the United States since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 that close economic engagement with China would produce an increasingly democratic country that would be closely tied to an international economic order founded mainly on Western liberal ideals.\n\nThat has not happened.\n\nChina has indeed grown in prosperity, leaping into the ranks of what the World Bank defines as upper-middle income countries. Its economy is now bigger than any other country except the United States. Its manufacturing sector is now bigger than those of the United States, Germany and South Korea combined.\n\nBut in the last five years, China has veered toward increasingly repressive authoritarianism at home and a rapid military buildup. The State Department estimates that Beijing has put 800,000 to two million Muslims in hastily built internment camps ringed with barbed wire in northwestern China. The Chinese government has built an archipelago of air bases on artificial islands in the South China Sea in between Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. And China now has the world's largest navy and has conducted military exercises as far away as East Africa and the Baltic Sea.\n\nOn the economic front, the competition is even fiercer. Trump administration officials warn that China is trying to dominate the global 5G infrastructure that will be the basis for future mobile communications and is competing to set other technological standards that will determine which global companies win.\n\nChina is extending low-cost loans and building infrastructure around the globe through its One Belt, One Road program, which critics warn is making poorer countries beholden to China. It is out-investing the United States in some high-tech industries, and is gaining dominance in certain segments, like mobile payment, new energy vehicles and areas of artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile American companies have long hankered for access to China's growing market, their position has begun to shift as they see China's practices and treatment of foreign companies. A survey released by the American Chamber of Commerce in China in February showed that the majority of its members favored retaining tariffs on Chinese goods while trade negotiations continued.\n\nChina's own experts say that the Beijing leadership has been caught off guard by the pace of change in American perceptions of Sino-American relations.\n\n\"Even if there is some kind of agreement between Xi and Trump, in the long run the strategic bilateral relationship is already in trouble,\" said Zhang Jian, a professor in the School of Government at Peking University. \"There is no coming back, even if there is a deal.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/12/us/12dc-tradewar-sub-2/merlin_153827598_526c0d28-e557-4511-a8da-a90f4aa0af0b-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4782070", "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 295291320}, {"uri": "1133234652", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-11", "time": "00:06:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-11T00:06:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-seeks-removal-of-huaweis-lead-defense-lawyer/2019/05/10/a3232d5a-6da4-11e9-be3a-33217240a539_story.html", "title": "Justice Department seeks removal of Huawei's lead defense lawyer", "body": "By Ellen Nakashima Ellen Nakashima National security reporter May 10 at 7:48 PM\n\nFederal prosecutors are seeking the removal of the lead defense lawyer for a Chinese firm charged with bank fraud and sanctions violations, alleging he has a conflict of interest arising from his supervision of a \"substantially related\" case while he served in a prior position as the Justice Department's second highest ranking official.\n\nJames Cole, who was deputy attorney general from 2010 to 2015 in the Obama administration, heads the defense team for Huawei Technologies Co.

Later that month, DOJ informed Cole he had a conflict of interest in the case, according to the motion.\n\nIn a follow-up meeting, Cole, DOJ and the FBI met again to discuss the issue, and after giving him a one-day clearance, the government provided Cole with \"privileged and classified\" information \"in order to have a fulsome discussion,\" prosecutors said.\n\nIn March, Cole declined to recuse himself, writing to the government that after carefully considering the material, he and his counsel \"were unable to determine that I need to be disqualified.\"\n\nLater that month he filed a motion to appear in court for Huawei. And at the first status conference on April 4, the government said it would not oppose Cole's motion for the time being. Last Thursday, prosecutors asked the court to have him removed.\n\n\"It's a considerable decision to seek to disqualify not just any counsel in a major prosecution like this, but someone of Jim Cole's pedigree as a former deputy attorney general who clearly has refused to recuse himself,\" said David Laufman, a former senior Justice Department official who is now a partner at the law firm of Wiggin and Dana. \"But the government clearly feels strongly about its motion and is prepared to litigate its merits.\"\n\nWhile the deputy attorney general oversees a broad range of the department's most significant cases, he or she does not typically get involved in the day-to-day running of investigations.\n\n\"It's difficult to determine whether the government has a valid argument because of the classified nature of the underlying matter,\" said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan who teaches law at the University of Michigan. \"The court will have to review his response and the underlying documents to make a determination. \"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/f3K7qXgxyJCXYjbadRZlCSgVKjs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZT4KSKDTPUI6TC7AZJLVM4HJDQ.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4781544", "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 295229160}, {"uri": "1133215952", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-10", "time": "23:18:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-10T23:18:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.800000011920929, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/business/huawei-lawyer-james-cole.html", "title": "Huawei's Prosecutors Ask Judge to Remove Its Lead Lawyer", "body": "Federal prosecutors want to disqualify the former deputy attorney general who is defending the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies in a bank fraud case because the government believes his previous work for it poses a conflict of interest.\n\nIn a filing on Friday in federal court in Brooklyn, prosecutors said the attorney, James M.

But Mr. Cole's tenure at the Department of Justice -- from the end of 2010 to the beginning of 2015 -- may have overlapped with the period when federal authorities were gathering information on Huawei and its business dealings.\n\nMr. Cole is now co-head of the white-collar and investigations practice at the Sidley Austin law firm.

But it was not a surprise.\n\nLast week, federal prosecutors notified the judge in the case, Ann M. Donnelly, that they had filed a sealed motion to disqualify Mr. Cole.

Since 2011, China Mobile has sought federal permission to provide services connecting phone calls between people in the United States and other countries, operating as a critical nexus for international phone traffic.\n\nBut Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai charged that the firm is \"owned and controlled by the Chinese government,\" a tie that raised a \"significant risk\" that authorities there could \"conduct activities that would seriously jeopardize the national security, law enforcement and economic interests of the United States.\"\n\nThe agency's Republicans and Democrats largely agreed, and some encouraged the FCC to take additional, future steps to block Chinese-tied telecom giants from operating in the United States or selling their equipment here. Their calls for further scrutiny come at a moment of tense talks between the White House and Chinese officials over tariffs the U.S. has imposed in response to the president's claims that the existing bilateral trade relationship is unfair.\n\nChina Mobile did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n[How China's Huawei took the lead over U.S. companies in 5G technology]\n\nFor Pai and the FCC, the decision to deny China Mobile access to U.S. networks marks the Trump administration's latest salvo against China over security concerns. Broadly, top U.S. officials have raised alarms about the potential for snooping when the country's top carriers begin deploying the infrastructure for 5G, the next generation of ultra-fast wireless service.\n\nMost of the equipment that makes 5G wireless possible is manufactured internationally, including in China by its top telecom company, Huawei. Its worldwide scale, its backing by China's state-owned development bank, and its perceived ties to a government known for espionage have fueled fears that U.S. networks could be at risk if more of Huawei's equipment is deployed here. U.S authorities, however, have never offered a full accounting of the security risks Huawei poses -- and Huawei has rejected the charges.\n\nStill, the White House for more than a year has considered issuing an executive order that could allow the government to prevent American businesses from working with certain foreign suppliers -- a move that could have the effect of barring Chinese firms. A spokesman for the president did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.\n\nAt the same time, the FCC has opened debate on rules that would withhold billions of dollars in critical federal funding from U.S. telecom carriers that purchase and install equipment from countries deemed to be security risks -- another effort that would deal a major blow to Huawei. Many U.S. carriers in rural areas rely on Huawei's equipment because it is cheaper than the alternatives, and they've warned they could become \"collateral damage in a larger national security and trade debate.\"\n\nAhead of Thursday's vote to block China Mobile, Democratic FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks urged his peers to return to the Huawei matter \"quickly to resolve any uncertainties\" involving carriers who have already deployed that equipment.\n\nCommissioner Brendan Carr, a Republican, urged the FCC to take aim at two other Chinese carriers, China Telecom and China Unicom, that already have been granted waivers to operate in the United States. \"The evidence I've seen in this case calls those existing authorizations into question,\" he said in prepared remarks, pointing to reports that China Telecom \"has been hijacking U.S. traffic and redirecting it through China.\" Neither of those companies responded to a request for comment.\n\nPai, the commissioner's chairman, later said the agency is reviewing authorizations the agency has granted those two companies.\n\nAnd Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel -- who voted to block China Mobile -- still criticized the agency's efforts as \"performative security,\" noting it did little to change the status quo. She pointed to other vulnerabilities in U.S. networks, including recent reports about the misuse of Americans' location data, in calling on the FCC to redouble its efforts to protect Americans' sensitive information.\n\n\"Here's a hard truth: Today no communications system is ever fully secure,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7olMIuFsEIchRGVYkB21Hiu_Lfg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2KGT5CD374I6RLCOIIPPOFSZEM.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4776734", "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 295121340}, {"uri": "1132076769", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-09", "time": "15:36:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-09T15:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/chinese-court-delays-ruling-on-canadians-death-sentence-appeal/2019/05/09/d0a9e098-7263-11e9-b5ca-3d72a9fa8ff1_story.html", "title": "Chinese court delays ruling on Canadian's death sentence appeal", "body": "By Anna Fifield Anna Fifield Beijing bureau chief. May 9 at 11:10 AM\n\nBEIJING -- A Chinese court has delayed ruling on a Canadian man's appeal against his death sentence for drug smuggling, just hours after a Canadian court set a September date for the next hearing in an extradition case against a top Chinese executive.\n\nThe ruling by the Chinese court further fuels concerns that Robert Lloyd Schellenberg's case is being influenced by politics.\n\n\"Why wait? What's the reasoning?\" asked James Zimmerman, an American lawyer in Beijing who represented two Canadian citizens detained in a previous, unrelated tit-for-tat case. \"Announcing later probably means the issue is too sensitive and 'we'll keep it in our back pocket for leverage.' \"\n\nSchellenberg, 36, \"made a very clear and complete self-defense,\" his attorney, Zhang Dongshuo, told Canada's Globe and Mail. It is the Canadian's final formal avenue for appeal against his death sentence.\n\nSchellenberg was sentenced in November to 15 years in prison and a $22,000 fine after being convicted of conspiring to send a quarter-ton of methamphetamine to Australia hidden in a shipment of tires. He denied the charge, saying he was in the port city of Dalian as a tourist.\n\nLess than a month later, Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer at Huawei Technologies and daughter of the company's founder, on a U.S. arrest warrant. The Justice Department wants to charge her with violating sanctions against Iran.\n\nHuawei is a \"national champion\" in China, and Meng is corporate royalty.\n\n[Canada arrested Huawei's Meng for the United States. As China retaliates, it's on its own. ]\n\nThe case quickly became a flash point between Canada, which says it is simply following the law, and China, which has accused Canada of doing the United States' dirty work. China has since arrested two Canadian nationals, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, and blocked much of Canada's canola and pork exports.\n\nA month after Meng's arrest, China declared Schellenberg's 15-year prison term too lenient and sentenced him to death, a decision that was widely seen as retribution.\n\nSchellenberg challenged the decision, and the Liaoning High People's Court met Thursday to consider his appeal, stressing that it was adhering to the law.\n\n\"During the trial, the appellant Schellenberg's various legal rights were guaranteed in accordance with the law, and two defense lawyers and an interpreter hired by court appeared with him,\" the court said in a statement.\n\n\"More than 50 people, including Canadian embassy officials, National People's Congress deputies, Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference members and people from different circles, attended the trial,\" it said.\n\nBut the authorities did not allow entry to diplomats from nine other countries who had traveled to Dalian for the hearing, including representatives of the United States, Britain, and other European nations, including Germany and France.\n\nOne diplomat said the representatives traveled to Dalian to show the Chinese authorities that they were watching the case very closely. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing declined to comment.\n\nAnother Canadian, Fan Wei, was sentenced to death in Guangdong late last month in another drug trafficking case.\n\nThursday's hearing started just hours after a Vancouver court adjourned after setting a timeline for Meng's extradition case.\n\nMeng is due back in court in September, and her attorneys have said they plan to argue that her arrest was an \"abuse of power\" and that she should not be extradited to the United States.\n\n[In a twist, Canada asks U.S. for help cracking down at its southern border ]\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Thursday that China's position was clear.\n\n\"The U.S. and Canada abused their bilateral extradition treaty and took compulsory measures against a Chinese citizen without reason. This is a severe violation of the legitimate rights of the Chinese citizen and also a severe political incident,\" he said at a regular news briefing. \"We again urge the U.S. to revoke the arrest warrant and extradition request against Meng Wanzhou.

And American businesses and consumers stand to pay the price.\n\nTrump believes that the Chinese -- not Americans -- will absorb the pain of 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow morning if trade talks with a Chinese delegation in Washington today don't yield an agreement.\n\nTrump on Wednesday again said he is \"very happy with over $100 Billion a year in Tariffs filling U.S. coffers .\u2009.\u2009. great for U.S., not good for China!\"\n\nEconomists say the president is persistently wrong about how tariffs work: American importers and consumers have borne the brunt of the duties he has imposed so far -- and will continue to shoulder the burden if Trump follows through on his threat.\n\nFurther, they say, the scale of the fight he's proposing to mount against the world's second-biggest economy will bring fallout at home for the economy as a whole and compound pain for key industries and consumers.\n\nThe overall impact of the new tariffs would not be enough, say, to drag the U.S. into a recession. But it would have a measurable impact on economic growth, said economists I interviewed.\n\nJoel Prakken, chief U.S. economist for Macroeconomic Advisers by IHS Markit, projects a .1 percent hit to GDP growth this year and next if the new tariffs are implemented. Others say it will be greater: Ryan Sweet, director of real-time economics at Moody's Analytics, estimates a .3 percent impact.\n\n\"That's not enormous,\" he says, but he points to \"spillover effects,\" including newly turbulent financial markets that could in turn rattle business confidence, slowing new investment. \"The economy's fundamentals overall are solid, and the odds of a recession are low. The risk is we talk ourselves into one.\"\n\nAnd the relatively modest macro effects of the tariffs may be cold comfort to those businesses in the crosshairs and consumers set to face higher prices on goods from soap to air conditioners. The new levies \"would apply 25% levies on more than $40 billion worth of items purchased directly by consumers -- furniture, handbags, clothing, Christmas decorations, fire alarms and other things shoppers find on the shelves at Target, Walmart, Macy's and other stores,\" the Wall Street Journal's Josh Zumbrun wrote this week.\n\nAmerican shoppers already have been facing higher prices from the levies the Trump administration has so far imposed. A study published in March from economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Columbia University and Princeton University found that in 2018, Trump's tariffs were costing consumers and the firms importing targeted goods an extra $3 billion a month in extra taxes.\n\nThe burden has been particularly acute for certain key sectors, including auto parts companies, which help form the manufacturing base in Ohio.\n\n\"Their costs have gone up because of steel and aluminum and other electronics we buy from China,\" says Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \"The end user probably isn't willing to eat all of those costs, so the companies are doing less well, and the workers for those companies aren't going to do as well and won't see wage increases they might have gotten.\"\n\nBusiness chiefs are warning the pain will only get worse if Trump escalates the battle.\n\nPolaris Industries CEO Scott Wine, whose company makes snowmobiles, ATVs, and motorcycles, said Tuesday the escalation would be \"catastrophic\" for his business. \"Through no fault of our own, one-third of our net income could go away,\" he told CNBC.\n\nEmerson Electric Co., a large manufacturer that produces everything from climate control systems to garbage disposals, has raised prices to keep up with higher costs from the tariffs, but its commercial unit has still seen its profit margins shrink. The company estimated tariffs on the books would cost it $125 million this year. The latest ISM manufacturing survey is littered with executives citing tariff worries, though others say they've already priced in a possible escalation.\n\nThe damage would be compounded by the moves Beijing makes to strike back. Chinese officials on Wednesday pledged to launch \"necessary countermeasures\" if the Trump administration goes through with the Friday escalation.\n\nIt's not clear yet what those might be. But farmers have already gotten a taste. Beijing has slapped steep tariffs on American soy, corn and wheat exports; after Trump's Sunday tweets, grain markets dropped to a 42-year low. Farmer bankruptcies, meanwhile, have been soaring, in part due to tariff pressures -- rising nearly a third in six Midwestern states last year.\n\nYet even as the next round of Trump tariffs look imminent, the administration appears to have left itself some wiggle room to extend this week's negotiations without implementing them.\n\nThe Trump team's official notice of the new levies carves out any shipments already on their way here from China when the tariffs would take effect. \"They didn't put this language in there when they made these announcements last year,\" Bown notes, speculating it could be an attempt to buy some extra time for the talks.\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\n-- China fires back: Beijing made it clear it is not backing down in the face of Trump's threats. In fact, China warned it stands ready to retaliate in the escalating trade war, my colleague Anna Fifield and David J. Lynch report.\n\nThe Chinese have taken a harder line because they thought Trump was desperate for a deal. The suddenly tougher posture from Beijing owes to an April 30 tweet by Trump complaining that while the Chinese central bank is helping stimulate growth there, the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, according to reporting by the WSJ's Lingling Wei and Bob Davis. Chinese negotiators took that as a sign that Trump viewed the U.S. economy as fragile and would be eager to compromise.\n\nTrump: \"They broke the deal.\" The president, addressing a rally in Florida on Wednesday night, via Reuters: \"You see the tariffs we're doing? Because they broke the deal. ... They broke the deal. So they're flying in. The vice premier tomorrow is flying in, but they broke the deal. They can't do that. So they'll be paying. If we don't make the deal, nothing wrong with taking in more than $100 billion a year.\"\n\n-- Huawei executive gets new bail terms. \"A Canadian judge on Wednesday altered the bail terms of a Chinese tech executive facing possible extradition to the United States on fraud charges, granting her lawyers' request that she be allowed to move from a $6 million, six-bedroom house in Vancouver to a $16 million, seven-bedroom mansion,\" the New York Times's Dan Bilefsky reports.\n\nTrump's role: The president previously said he was willing to \"intervene\" in Meng's case, comments that Meng's lawyer, attorney Scott Fenton, said he would use to prove the charges are politically motivated and they were \"'intimidating and corrosive of the rule of law' and should disqualify the United States from being able to extradite Ms. Meng,\" Bilefsky writes.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump appears to be losing the battle to ban Huawei gear from global networks, Bloomberg reports.\n\nNew York lawmakers advance bill allowing release of Trump's state tax returns: \"The New York State Senate passed legislation Wednesday that would allow President Trump's state tax returns to be turned over to congressional committees, a move that could pave the way for House Democrats to obtain the president's closely guarded financial records,\" my colleague Jeff Stein reports. \"The bill must still be approved by the State Assembly and signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D-N.Y.), but Cuomo has expressed support for the measure and Democrats have a majority in the legislature's lower chamber.\"\n\n-- Global stocks flinch in face of trade tensions. WSJ's Paul Davies: \"European and Asian stocks fell Thursday as China hardened its line going into trade talks set to start later in Washington. Shares across Asia fell with Chinese A-shares down 1.5% in Shanghai, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong 2.4% lower and Korean stocks down 3%. The Stoxx Europe 600 was 0.7% lower in early trade, while the FTSE 100 in London was down 0.5%.\n\n\"U.S. stocks were priced to open lower on Thursday with futures on both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average down about 0.8%. The broad index was down 0.2% at the close on Wednesday, having been up as much as 0.5% earlier in the day.\"\n\nBut it could be worse. The S&P 500 was down 2.2 percent over the first three days of this week, \"only about a month's worth of gains; markets were lower as recently as early April,\" the New York Times's Neil Irwin points out. He cites a \"Trump Put\" bucking up investors even as U.S.-China trade talks look to be deteriorating this week. That is, investors believe Trump keeps an eye on the health of financial markets and will strike \"some kind of deal, even if it does little to address long-term economic tensions between the United States and China,\" to reverse a market rout.\n\n-- Bond market sends up a warning flare. Bloomberg's Robert Burgess: \"Global markets got a glimpse of the unthinkable Wednesday when the U.S. held a key bond auction. The $27 billion sale of 10-year notes - the world's benchmark securities - didn't go well at all. It wasn't a failure; that would have triggered no less than an Armageddon-type event on par with the financial crisis. But the poor demand sure sparked a lot of questions, including whether this was a sign that investors finally had enough of the government's profligate spending and borrowing...\n\n\"Nothing scares big investors more than the notion that the U.S. could hold a bond auction and nobody showed up. After all, Treasuries are the world's safest investment, backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. But on Wednesday, investors sent a message to the Treasury Department that past isn't prologue when it comes to demand for U.S. debt.\n\nPrescription drug ads will soon have to include pricing information. \"Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Wednesday that the Trump administration is finalizing rules for drugmakers to disclose list prices of medications costing more than $35 for a month's supply,\" the Associated Press' Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar reports.\n\nRemember: There have multiple reports that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) staff and the White House are discussing a deal to lower prescription drug prices. Trump made lowering prices one of the centerpieces of his campaign and polls show the issue continues to be among the top concerns of voters. But with everything going on, it's probably safe to bet that much more limited policies like requiring some price transparency are more likely that a sweeping bipartisan deal.\n\nThe Export-Import bank is back ... for now. After inspiring some \"of the most bitter disputes in Republican circles this decade,\" the Export-Import bank now has enough board members to form a quorum again, my colleague Paul Kane reports. \"No federal agency has lived such a bizarre state of suspended animation,\" Paul sums up of the protracted battle between conservatives and more mainstream Republicans over the future of the agency that provides loan guarantees to U.S. companies doing business abroad.\n\nThe future of Fannie and Freddie: \"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's new overseer said the mortgage giants can be freed from government control even if Congress doesn't pass a housing-finance overhaul,\" Bloomberg's Austin Weinstein reports. \"Lawmakers will get 'at least an entire Congress' to act before the companies are freed, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria said during an interview with Bloomberg.\n\n'Impressive': How Fox News is talking about Trump's taxes:\n\nSee baby Archie: Prince Harry and Meghan debut newest royal baby:", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/f497f1025a45d13cc1a2b569118bd197-4228-2819-70-8-AASUCEDR4EI6TEZRGC6FQNXURY.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4770178", "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 295100760}, {"uri": "1131629141", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-09", "time": "05:04:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-09T05:04:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/09/pompeos-visit-britain-shows-special-relationship-adrift/", "title": "Analysis | Pompeo's visit to Britain shows the special relationship adrift", "body": "By Adam Taylor Adam Taylor Foreign reporter who writes about a variety of subjects May 9 at 12:59 AM\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know? Sign up for the Today's WorldView newsletter.\n\n(Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg)\n\nAs Britain welcomed a swaddled, snoozing baby named Archie to their royal family on Wednesday, there was another, less heralded and less tranquil, arrival in London: That of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nIn Britain for his first visit since becoming the top U.S. diplomat, Pompeo offered a relentless defense of U.S.-British relations, telling reporters that \"the special relationship is the beating heart of the free world.\" Pompeo even offered a rare positive spin on the economic effects of Brexit in a speech at the Center for Policy Studies.\n\n\"President Trump is eager for a new free-trade agreement that will take our Number 1 trade relationship to unlimited new heights,\" he said.\n\nBut for all these optimistic words, Pompeo's time in London was ultimately a reminder that at the moment, this transatlantic partnership is not as rosy as Meghan and Harry's.\n\nPompeo repeatedly used British history to chide the government for not following Trump administration policy. Asked at a news conference about the Iran nuclear deal, from which President Trump withdrew the United States one year ago -- despite protests from the British government -- the secretary of state invoked Winston Churchill's battle against Nazi Germany.\n\n\"So not far from here are the Churchill War Rooms, where a leader of this great country stared evil in the face and recognized the threat that evil presented to the entire world,\" Pompeo said. \"We're working together to push back against that threat.\"\n\nHours later, he pondered how the late British Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher would have handled a rising China, after media reports about Britain's willingness to work with the Chinese telecom giant Huawei.\n\n\"Would the Iron Lady be silent when China violates the sovereignty of nations through corruption or coercion?\" he said. \"I know it's a sensitive topic, but we have to talk about sensitive things, as friends.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Pompeo, not all Britons have his rosy view of Westminster's relationship with Washington. Pompeo may hark back to the days of Churchill and Thatcher, but many Britons still have bitter feelings about more recent history -- in particular, the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that Britain supported.\n\nNow, the Trump administration's recent combative tone with Iran has people worried again. The United States issued new sanctions against Iran on Wednesday after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani threatened to start enriching more uranium.\n\nThe United States deployed an aircraft carrier and bomber group to the Persian Gulf this week in what it said was a response to an Iranian plan to attack U.S. military personnel in the region. The Times of London's Richard Spencer wrote Wednesday that the Trump administration's Iran strategy represented \"undoubtedly, the single most dangerous near-term threat to world peace.\"\n\nPompeo was questioned about conflict in the Middle East during his trip. During a meeting with faith leaders Wednesday morning, he was pushed by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the leader of the Church of England, on how foreign military intervention helped create conditions that led to the declining Christian population in Iraq. \"Foreign interventions can often have very serious long-term consequences,\" Welby said.\n\nThis skepticism of American foreign policy extends beyond Middle Eastern matters. Pompeo found himself faced with doubts concerning the U.S. role in backing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 in a bid to topple Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that his Labour Party opposes \"outside interference in Venezuela, whether from the U.S. or anywhere else.\"\n\nWhen a journalist asked Pompeo what he made of Corbyn's apparent support of Maduro, Pompeo said in unusually undiplomatic language that it was \"disgusting\" to see leaders back the \"murderous dictator.\"\n\nFew thought that Pompeo's insult would harm Corbyn's reputation. In fact, it might aid it. \"A top Trump official calling Corbyn 'disgusting' is a gift to Corbyn, regardless of where you stand on Venezuela,\" tweeted British journalist Mehdi Hasan.\n\nEven on Brexit, a policy that Trump openly supports, U.S. trade policy is a real worry for London. A Guardian editorial that coincided with Pompeo's visit noted that Trump's trade deal with China, if it comes to pass, would bypass the World Trade Organization -- the very institution on which Brexit hard-liners hope to fall back in the event of a \"no-deal\" Brexit.\n\nSo if British interests are so out of line with the United States's, why is Trump heading to London in June for a state visit? Writing in the New Statesman last month, Stephen Bush noted that Trump's unpopularity among Britons \"weakens Brexit just by association.\"\n\nPart of the problem is that, beleaguered by Brexit, Britain has left many other foreign policy problems -- including the fraught special relationship with Trump -- on autopilot, yielding directionless and contradictory policies.\n\n\"On Iran, Britain remains caught in its own corridor of uncertainty between the contrasting responses of its European and American allies, while on Huawei it is trapped between its increasing engagement with China and the age-old temptation of refighting the cold war,\" the Guardian's Martin Kettle wrote Wednesday.\n\nThere had been some hope that baby Archie, entitled to a U.S. passport through his American mother, might herald a new era in Anglo-American relations. \"This was good news on both sides of the Atlantic,\" Pompeo said.\n\nBut if there is a baby who sums up the current state of the special relationship, it isn't Archie. It is the big, fat, orange, diaper-wearing blimp that is expected to rise, once against, to greet Trump as he arrives in London on June 3.\n\nRight now, like the blimp, the special relationship is at risk of floating away, adrift.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

This is just what China wants -- to divide western alliances,\" Mr. Pompeo said.\n\nMr. Pompeo also said at an earlier news conference, however, that he has \"great confidence that the United Kingdom will never take an action that will break the special relationship,\" a reference to the close ties of the two nations and a comment that reassured some British officials that damage to relations with the United States can be avoided.\n\nBritain's foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told reporters that the government had not made its final decision on Huawei, and would never take a decision that would compromise its ability to share intelligence with its closest allies, \"or in particular with the United States.\"\n\nBritish officials believe that it is possible to give Huawei some access to noncore elements of its new 5G system while maintaining the security of more sensitive networks.\n\nThe United States has warned several governments around Europe against working with Huawei, and the topic has become increasingly touchy as countries decide on how to build their 5G networks.\n\nThe issue is particularly delicate for a British government that is planning to leave the European Union and wants to forge stronger economic links with China and other Asian economies, while also building on its close diplomatic and trading relationship with the United States.\n\nMr. Williamson was fired last week after an investigation into a report in The Daily Telegraph regarding discussions about the Huawei decision in Britain's National Security Council, of which Mr. Williamson was a member.\n\nThe article suggested that Mrs. May had overruled objections from some cabinet ministers, including Mr. Williamson, about bringing the Chinese company into the 5G project. Mr. Williamson has denied being the source of the leak.\n\nIn Parliament on Wednesday, Julian Lewis, a senior lawmaker in Mrs. May's Conservative Party and chairman of the House of Commons Defense Committee, asked the prime minister whether it would not \"be na\u00efve to the point of negligence to allow Huawei further to penetrate our critical national infrastructure.\"\n\nMrs. May said she was \"not considering any options that would put our national security communications at risk, either within the U.K. or with our closest allies.\"\n\nDuring his visit, Mr. Pompeo, who held talks with Mrs. May and Mr. Hunt, also made an apparent swipe at their political adversary, Jeremy Corbyn, the left-wing leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party. Speaking at his news conference, Mr. Pompeo described the support of some politicians for the Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, as \"disgusting.\"\n\nUnlike the British government, Labour has refused to condemn Mr. Maduro, arguing that Venezuela's political future was a matter for its own citizens.

Raymond Zhong, a technology reporter based in Beijing, discussed the tech he's using.\n\nWhat are your most important tech tools for reporting in China?\n\nThe Chinese internet is like the small-town setting of a crime novel: Things are mysteriously disappearing from it all the time.\n\nSocial media posts vanish. News and blog articles are taken down. Sensitive bits are excised from videos. You can't always predict what will be removed, either by censors or by a regular person starting to have second thoughts about his or her own unfiltered utterance. Even pages on the websites of government agencies and major corporations have a way of quietly falling into black holes.\n\nThat's why a Google Chrome extension called Full Page Screen Capture is invaluable for internet research in China. With one click, I get a screen shot of an entire page, top to bottom. An embarrassingly large share of the files on my laptop are PDFs generated this way. I only wish a similar function were built into my iPhone, as it is on Huawei handsets.\n\nGoogle sometimes caches past versions of web pages, as does the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. These crawlers don't preserve everything. But when you manage to discover in the archives the exact page you've been hunting for, frozen for posterity at exactly the right moment, it's an incredible endorphin rush.\n\nFor capturing streaming videos before they are taken down, I use QuickTime Player to take a recording of my screen. There are also sites that convert videos from YouTube and other platforms into downloadable files. I won't name these services. The video sites don't like them, so they're constantly being shut down.\n\nReporting in an authoritarian country is a struggle of memory against forgetting. These tools help.\n\nHow does online consumerism like shopping and ordering food delivery differ there? How do you personally use these apps?\n\nI spent most of my adult life not buying much online except books. But, oh Lordy, have I fallen for e-commerce since moving to Beijing last year.\n\nTo scroll through Taobao, Alibaba's largest shopping platform, is to be awed by the sheer amount of our physical world that is being produced in China. Normal stuff like dustpans and kitchen timers. Weird stuff like latte cups shaped like skulls, wine glasses with a built-in straw and Barbie dolls that serve as racks for slices of raw meat before they go into a hot pot. Detailed knockoffs of Lego sets and whatever latest abominable thing Justin Bieber has been photographed wearing.\n\nDo you know how many vendors are out there selling giant pillows printed to look like pieces of grilled meat? I bet that you do not.\n\nMy head swims with grandiose thoughts when I'm on Taobao. Thoughts like: Factories are making this stuff because people buy it. Who are these people? How do the factories even find out about them? What if shopping apps, and not social media, are the real mirror that mobile technology is holding up to our society?\n\nCome to think of it, I still don't buy that much online. I just like to look and ponder.\n\nMany people in China have stopped using cash. They conduct their entire lives on a single app, WeChat. Electric cars are everywhere. Is China \"The Jetsons\"?\n\nNo, though I do often see people on hoverboards barreling down city streets while talking on their cellphones.\n\nChina is rightly recognized for having made big leaps in the digital realm. But there are many unglamorous reasons behind Chinese tech companies' success.\n\nLabor is cheap, and cities are densely populated -- perfect for e-commerce, ride-hailing, and food and grocery delivery. People also tend to adopt new technologies with gusto because in a country that was quite poor not long ago, it's not easy to get misty eyed about life before the internet.\n\nThe offline world in China is still rough in some ways. The skies are polluted. The traffic is bad. Staffs in shops and restaurants are surly. Most people will happily use technology to avoid all this if they can.\n\nA few months ago, I had a broken water pipe at home, and for some reason I decided to call a plumber who had left his number on a sticker in my building. He ripped me off, big time. Next time I'm trying an app.\n\nEven dealing with the Chinese bureaucracy is getting less torturous, sort of. This year, the tax authorities want more people to use their app. Which sounds good, except I still had to go across town and show my passport to get the six-digit code needed to activate the app.\n\nHoverboards aside, what gadget trends are emerging?\n\nIn a country as gadget crazy as China, it's interesting that smart speakers aren't taking off as they are in the United States. A lot of people I know are buying hand-held voice translation devices, usually for older relatives. They don't work so well, I'm told. But at least they try to solve a real problem.\n\nRecently, I watched a waiter in a hotel restaurant communicate with foreign guests using a voice translation app. \"China needs to get better at English to become stronger in the world,\" the waiter said, and the app read out his words in English.\n\nIt was all very poignant -- until one guest barked at the waiter about a broken juice machine, and the app dutifully translated his insults into Chinese.\n\nOutside of your job, what tech product are you personally obsessed with?

(Lindsey Wasson/Reuters) By Emily Rauhala Emily Rauhala Staff writer covering Canada and foreign affairs May 8 at 6:00 AM\n\nIn its diplomatic battle with China, Canada could use some backup. But its closest ally, the United States, seems to be occupied waging other wars.\n\nSince Canada arrested a Chinese technology executive on U.S. charges in December, China has hit Canada hard, detaining two Canadians on vague allegations and stopping some imports of canola oil, a key Canadian product.\n\nThe U.S. officials seeking to extradite Huawei Technologies' chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, offered Canada a polite \"thanks\" for arresting her. But as China punishes Canada for fulfilling the U.S. request, there has been little help from the White House, which is focused, for now, on cutting a trade deal with China.\n\nWith Meng due in a Vancouver courtroom Wednesday for a hearing to schedule the start of the extradition process, an exasperated Canada is bracing for further political or economic retaliation from Beijing -- and no longer expecting much from Washington.\n\n\"Not only are we navigating around a hostile China, but we need to do that without all the guarantees and protections that we have had in the past,\" said David Mulroney, who served as Canada's ambassador to China from 2009 to 2012.\n\nThe Canadian conundrum raises a question familiar to small countries that have found themselves in China's bad books: How do you stand up to a soon-to-be-superpower, particularly without clear, consistent U.S. support?\n\nSo far, Canada has struggled.\n\n[In a twist, Canada asks U.S. for help cracking down at its southern border]\n\nMeng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, leaves her house for a hearing at the British Columbia Supreme Court in Vancouver in March. (Jimmy Jeong/Bloomberg)\n\nThe conflict between Canada and China started with Meng's arrest in December on charges that she violated U.S. sanctions law by misstating her company's relationship with a subsidiary.\n\nHer arrest outraged Beijing. Soon, two Canadians in China, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, were detained on national security allegations that have yet to be explained. Then, a Canadian who had been sentenced to 15 years in Chinese prison for drug smuggling was hastily retried and sentenced to death.\n\nBeijing has cast Meng's arrest as a politically motivated foreign plot to contain China.\n\nOttawa has argued her arrest was a routine law enforcement matter, stressing that Canada was adhering to the terms of its extradition treaty with the United States, and that Meng will be treated just like anyone else -- an argument it expected to be echoed by the United States.\n\nInstead, President Trump shocked both Canadian and U.S. officials by tweeting that he would consider intervening in Meng's case if it could help him secure a favorable deal on trade.\n\nU.S. officials have since tried to walk that back, expressing the country's commitment to the rule of law and, at a news conference to unveil a range of charges against Huawei, thanking Canadian allies for their help. But uncertainty over the U.S. position lingers.\n\nCanadian officials know that a Trump tweet is not a policy statement and have tried to engage other U.S. officials. They have regularly raised the detention of the two Canadians with American colleagues.\n\nJim Carr, Canada's minister for international trade diversification, said the government is discussing the situation with allies \"literally every day.\"\n\n\"When you need your friends, you talk to your friends about how you need them,\" he said during a visit to Washington this week. \"Our American allies are aware of the situation.\"\n\n[Quebec ban on religious symbols would fall heavily on hijab-wearing teachers]\n\nSecurity guards march past a shop selling Apple and Huawei phones in Beijing. (Ng Han Guan/AP)\n\nSome are frustrated that this awareness has not translated into action.\n\nCanada's ambassador to the United States, David MacNaughton, has pointed out that Canada is cooperating with the United States on several fronts, including Venezuela and NATO. He told Reuters last week that it might be less inclined to continue that assistance if it keeps getting nothing back.\n\n\"How do you go to canola farmers and relatives of the two [Canadian detainees] and say, 'Well, actually, notwithstanding all of this, we're going to try and do whatever we can to help?'\" he asked.\n\n\"It makes it much more difficult in public-opinion terms for the prime minister to have permission to do some of the things that would be in both countries' interests.\"\n\nA Canadian official familiar with the issue said Canada was not about to change course on questions of foreign policy such as the crisis in Venezuela -- but is indeed exasperated.\n\n\"We hope they will help us anyway,\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"This is causing some pain on our side, and we want to see a meaningful commitment from the rule of law on their side.\"\n\nCarr's job is to find new trading partners for Canada, which has long been heavily dependent on the United States. He said the dust-up reaffirmed the importance of his mandate.\n\n\"It makes sense, both in the medium and the long term, to develop other relationships, because you don't how bilateral relationships will go.\"\n\nRead more\n\nQuayside, Toronto's Google-linked smart city, draws opposition over privacy, costs\n\nMarijuana vs. beer: The new divide in Canadian politics\n\nCanadian trauma surgeons called for gun control.

It has since accused her of, among other things, fraudulently deceiving four banks to enable Huawei to evade American sanctions against Iran, and has accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets and obstructing a criminal investigation.\n\nWednesday's proceeding is not the extradition hearing itself but a proceeding to discuss next steps in the case.\n\nWhile awaiting a decision on her extradition -- which could take many months -- Ms. Meng has been out on bail of 10 million Canadian dollars, living in Vancouver in her $6 million, six-bedroom home. She can roam fairly freely about the city, although under 24-hour surveillance and wearing a GPS tracker on her ankle.\n\nIncensed by Ms. Meng's arrest, China has retaliated by arresting two Canadians, accusing them of espionage, while also sentencing two other Canadians to death on drug-related accusations.\n\nChina is also using its economic might to punish Canada. Recently, Beijing halted shipments of Canadian canola oil, saying they were contaminated; China bought about $2.7 billion worth of canola oil from Canada last year.\n\nChina has also suspended the permits of two large Canadian pork producers.\n\nAnd when the Canadian agriculture minister recently requested a trade visit to China, Canadian officials said the request was ignored.\n\nAll the while, President Trump is trying to hammer out a trade deal with China, and Canada is concerned that its citizens have become pawns in a geopolitical and economic battle between the United States and China in which Canada is paying a heavy price.\n\nShortly after Ms. Meng's arrest, Mr. Trump said he might consider interceding in the case if that helped him make a trade deal with China. Ms. Meng's lawyers have used his comment to bolster their argument that the criminal charges against Ms. Meng are politically motivated, which could possibly help her case.\n\nIn recent weeks, senior Canadian officials have expressed annoyance that the United States, a critical ally, is not doing enough to help secure the release of the two arrested Canadians -- Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman.\n\nIn an interview this week with Reuters, Canada's ambassador to Washington, David MacNaughton, expressed concern that Canada remained \"in the dark\" as to whether Mr. Trump was prepared to drop charges against Ms. Meng as part of a \"plea deal.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland tacitly warned the Trump administration not to link Ms. Meng's fate to a potential trade deal. \"Any effort to somehow suggest that a justice issue should be mixed up with influence of trade issues is entirely inappropriate,\" she said.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods. Canadian officials say privately that they fear Mr. Trump could use Ms. Meng as a bargaining chip in the trade talks, without sufficiently addressing the case of the detained Canadians.\n\n\"Canada is appealing to the U.S. for help but it is in a weak position and doesn't have a lot of cards to play,\" said Wenran Jiang, a senior fellow at the Institute of Asian Research at the University of British Columbia. \"It can't control Trump, and retaliating against China risks escalating tensions even more.\"\n\nLegal experts said that, under Canadian law, Ms. Meng faces an uphill struggle to avoid extradition.\n\n\"Due to Canadian extradition law, extradition is a stacked deck against the defendant, in this case Ms. Meng, because the evidence the defense can introduce is very limited,\" said Gary Botting, a leading extradition expert who has written several textbooks on Canadian extradition law and has advised Ms. Meng's legal team. \"An extradition hearing is not a trial.\"\n\nNevertheless, he noted that the final decision on extradition rested with Canada's justice minister, making it inevitable, he said, that politics could intervene in a proceeding that Canadian authorities have been at pains to emphasize must adhere to the rule of law.\n\n\"The politicization of the case is her best defense,\" he said.\n\nHe said he also expected her lawyers to emphasize the argument made in a separate civil case that Canadian authorities breached Ms. Meng's constitutional rights to due process when they stopped her while she was in transit, seizing her electronic devices, detaining her for three hours before she was arrested and denying her immediate access to a lawyer.\n\nHe cited a 2001 case of four men arrested in Canada and wanted in the United States in connection with a $22 million telemarketing fraud scheme.\n\nCanada's Supreme Court ruled that the United States had lost its right to extradite the men after a Pennsylvania prosecutor warned during the extradition process that the men could be raped in jail if they didn't surrender quietly.\n\n\"Their extradition hearing was compromised because the U.S. prosecutor interfered with their due process in a Canadian court,\" Mr. Botting explained.\n\nReferring to the manner in which Ms. Meng was arrested, he said her lawyers were likely to make a similar argument.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_bilefsky@nytimes.com", "name": "Dan Bilefsky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/08/world/08canada-huawei1/08canada-huawei1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4774807", "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 295006920}, {"uri": "1129231767", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-06", "time": "12:00:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-06T12:00:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2019/05/06/the-cybersecurity-202-a-cyberattack-just-disrupted-grid-operations-in-the-u-s-but-it-could-have-been-far-worse/5ccf61eda7a0a46cfe152c3e/", "title": "Analysis | The Cybersecurity 202: A cyberattack just disrupted grid operations in the U.S. But it could have been far worse.", "body": "A Pacific Gas and Electric Company worker cuts back branches from a tree that fell across power lines. (Kevin Johnson/Santa Cruz Sentinel/AP)\n\nA recently disclosed hack at an electric utility in the western United States crosses a disturbing new line.\n\nIt's the first time a digital attack is known to have interfered with electrical grid operations in the United States. And it was due to a relatively basic hack, raising the specter of what might happen if a sophisticated bad actor chose to launch a far more powerful attack, say, with the intent of shuting off electricity for millions of people.\n\nThe disruption, which took place March 5, was caused by a denial of service incident, an Energy Department official told E&E News's Blake Sobczak, who was the first to report on the issue. That means the utility -- which serves parts of California, Utah and Wyoming though the Energy Department didn't name it -- was basically overwhelmed with phony Web traffic.\n\nThe attack didn't cause customer outages or affect the reliability of the grid -- and there's no evidence it was part of a coordinated attack aimed at doing so, Blake reported. It's possible the attackers didn't even know they were targeting an electric utility.\n\nBut the fact that there was a disruption at all on critical infrastructure puts it in a highly concerning category. The best known successful grid attack by highly sophisticated hackers had far-reaching consequences: Hackers allegedly linked to the Russian government targeted portions of Ukraine's energy grid with a denial of service attack in 2015 and cut off electricity for several hours to tens of thousands of people.\n\nThat kind of outage, if it took place in the U.S., could cause hundreds of millions of dollars of damage or even cost lives -- for example, if hospitals were caught without a backup electricity supply.\n\nA 2015 report by the University of Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies estimated a major grid attack in the United States could cost up to $1 trillion in the most severe circumstances.\n\nThe disruption also highlights how poorly many utilities are prepared for such an attack.\n\nAccording to Blake, the attack relied on a computer bug that was widely known -- and there was a software patch that fixed it. That means if the utility had updated patches on all of its systems, the whole thing could have been averted.\n\nThe Energy Department has shared very little information about the hack. Most of what's known comes from a report that the department typically publishes after outages caused by major storms or other events that interrupt electrical supply. A report such as that may be triggered if a digital attack hit a target at the edge of a utility's network, such as a firewall or router, that doesn't affect core operations, industry sources told Blake.\n\n\"While a cyberattack on such equipment wouldn't disrupt the flow of electricity, it could force operators to pause or redirect certain activities at affected facilities to allow for an investigation,\" he reported.\n\nThe attack should be a wake-up call about the importance of ensuring utilities are consistently and effectively protecting themselves against cyberattacks, Robert M. Lee, a former NSA hacker who founded the cybersecurity company Dragos, said during a panel discussion I moderated Thursday.\n\nBut Lee also warned against overreacting to such attacks, which he said are sure to become more prevalent in coming years. After all, he said, electricity services are quite resilient and it would be exceptionally difficult to shut off power across a large area for a long time.\n\n\"I don't want to make light of threats poking and prodding our infrastructure,\" he said. \"But we also don't want to hype up the challenge.\"\n\nPINGED: President Trump during a lengthy phone conversation Friday didn't warn Russian President Vladimir Putin against interfering in the 2020 election, my colleagues Anne Gearan, John Wagner and Anton Troianovski reported.\n\nThat's despite stark warnings from intelligence and Homeland Security officials that Russia probably will attempt to undermine the 2020 contest as it did in 2016.\n\nTrump and Putin did, however, discuss the conclusion of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign -- which the president described as the \"Russian hoax\" on Twitter.\n\nAccording to Trump, Putin responded to the conclusion of the Mueller investigation by saying \"something to the effect that it started off as a mountain ... it ended up being a mouse.\" The president added that Putin \"knew there was no collusion whatsoever.\"\n\nMueller did not find sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against any members of the Trump campaign for assisting Russia's 2016 election interference operation.\n\nTrump has wavered on U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election -- often saying that he believes Russia interfered but other actors might have as well (including an anonymous 400-pound hacker).\n\nThe phrase \"Russian hoax\" gives Trump wiggle room to cast doubt on Russian interference in 2016 without outright claiming it, Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said on Twitter.\n\nPATCHED: Representatives from more than two dozen countries during a meeting in Prague on Friday agreed to a broad set of principles for how to secure 5G networks against spying and cyberattacks -- including language supported by U.S. diplomats that would make it tougher to give 5G contracts to Huawei and other Chinese firms.\n\nBut it's unclear how effective the voluntary agreement will be in actually restricting Huawei from U.S. allies' 5G networks. The agreement comes after several European nations, including Britain, have opted to allow Huawei to build some portion of their networks -- despite intense lobbying from U.S. diplomats who say the company could be a platform for Chinese spying.\n\nAmong other things, the Prague agreement urges nations to consider the \"overall risk of influence on a supplier by a third country\" and how bound a 5G supplier is by the rule of law. The White House praised the principles in a statement and said the United States plans to abide by them as it contracts to build its own 5G networks.\n\nPWNED: Facebook has told U.S. officials it's \"willing to submit to greater oversight of its data-collection practices -- from the launching of new services to the decisions of its top executives -- to end a wide-ranging federal probe into a series of privacy abuses that came to light last year,\" my colleague Tony Romm reported.\n\nThe enhanced oversight, if approved, would accompany a $3 billion to $5 billion fine over a slew of cases in which the social media giant allegedly failed to sufficiently safeguard users' personal information.\n\n\"Under such a settlement, Facebook would have to complete a more rigorous privacy review of new products and services before launching them,\" Tony reported, and would have to document to the FTC how it had evaluated the effects of data collection practices on its customers.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/cc674c1d79fa9fcfa250d59b061c7869-2958-2091-70-8-C74P7VSVUEI6TKUDKBHQQ27V2Y.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 294840000}, {"uri": "1127333900", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-03", "time": "13:31:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-03T13:31:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/national-digest-man-who-plotted-to-bomb-new-york-subways-then-spent-a-decade-helping-police-is-set-for-release/2019/05/02/87d59900-689c-11e9-8985-4cf30147bdca_story.html", "title": "National Digest: Man Who Plotted to Bomb New York Subways Then Spent a Decade Helping Police is Set for Release", "body": "Bomb plotter who helped police set to be released\n\nA man who plotted to bomb New York City's subways, then switched sides after his arrest and spent nearly a decade helping U.S. authorities identify and prosecute terrorists, was rewarded for his help Thursday with a sentence of 10 years in prison, effectively time he has already served.\n\nNajibullah Zazi, a 33-year-old naturalized citizen who became radicalized and received explosives training from al-Qaeda after traveling to Pakistan in 2008, faced up to life in prison after pleading guilty to terrorism-related charges.\n\nThe subway plot sent shock waves through New York and the federal law enforcement community, underscoring the continuing threat of terrorism years after 9/11. But federal prosecutors said Zazi, after his 2009 arrest, provided \"extraordinary\" assistance to U.S. counterterrorism authorities, implicating his closest friends and offering a window into the inner workings of al-Qaeda.\n\nU.S. District Judge Raymond J.

McClinton pleaded guilty to arson on March 28.\n\nInvestigators said McClinton belonged to the church that was vandalized and burned, Hopewell Missionary Baptist in Greenville.\n\nSome initially suspected the fire was a hate crime. But Washington County District Attorney Dewayne Richardson said McClinton was trying to hide illicit activities he had done inside the church. The night the church was burned, the members had planned to gather and McClinton believed they were going to disclose those activities, Richardson said.\n\nMcClinton was sentenced as a habitual offender because of felony convictions for attempted armed robbery in 1997 and armed robbery in 2004, both in another part of Mississippi.\n\nA man who fled to Mexico after authorities identified him as a suspect in the rape of a Connecticut university student has pleaded guilty to multiple charges.\n\nThe Connecticut Post reported that Edibaldo Duran, 29, pleaded guilty Thursday to home invasion and aggravated first-degree sexual assault for the September 2014 attack on the Sacred Heart University student.\n\nHe faces 20 years in prison and is scheduled to be sentenced July 12.\n\nAuthorities say Duran broke into the victim's apartment while she was asleep and raped her.\n\nPolice released a sketch of the suspect based on the victim's description, and two witnesses later identified the sketch as Duran.\n\nPolice tracked Duran to JFK airport, but his plane was gone by the time they arrived.

A Dose of Big Tech Data May Help", "body": "Each week, we review the week's news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nHi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news:\n\nI do it. You do it. We all do it: Look at screens. The. Whole. Time.\n\nTristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google who co-founded the Center for Humane Technology, recently issued a battle cry against the potent cocktail of data and algorithms that he said tech companies had designed to hijack human attention. He claimed that they were \"downgrading\" our attention spans, relationships, civility and more.\n\nThere's growing moral panic about our reliance on screens and the content, in particular social media, they display. My colleague Kevin Roose felt it, and forced himself to detox. (Spoiler: He liked it.)\n\nBut while researchers I've spoken with said the way we used devices could be troubling, they also said we didn't fully understand the problems or how to solve them.\n\nDr. Henrietta Bowden-Jones, the Royal College of Psychiatrists' spokeswoman on behavioral addictions, pointed out that not all screen time was equal.\n\n\"You can do all kinds of things on a phone,\" she said. \"The addiction is to the activity -- gambling, gaming, watching porn.\" Much of our time with screens can be a healthy, she added, analogous to, say, reading a book.\n\nA problem is that we lack granular insight about how people use their devices, making it hard to understand how damaging our relationships with them are.\n\nAs we've conducted more of our lives online, \"the amount of human behavior we can directly observe has been shrinking,\" said Andrew Przybylski, an experimental psychologist and director of research at the Oxford internet Institute. \"As time has gone on, the ability to formulate meaningful questions and then ask them of good data has diminished.\"\n\nExcept, some people do have access to such data: They work at companies like Facebook, Google and Apple. These companies all collect troves of information -- all locked away -- about how we use technology.\n\nInspired by our panic, Google and Apple have introduced tools to help users manage their digital activity. But should we trust tech companies to help curb tech use?\n\nMy colleague Jack Nicas reported that, since launching such tools for iPhones, Apple had purged other smartphone addiction apps from its App Store. Apple said it was over privacy violations; app makers said it was because their software could hurt Apple's business.\n\nIf the app makers are right, Apple is cornering the market on access to iPhone use data.\n\nThat would be troubling. If other companies and researchers had access to such data -- along with Facebook's likes, Netflix's streaming figures, Google's browsing histories and more -- they could study it to more accurately understand what is genuinely problematic about relationships with our devices, and develop meaningful interventions to overcome problems.\n\nThere are problems with this idea. Getting tech companies to give up data is hard, probably requiring regulatory intervention. Use of the data would obviously need to be closely policed. And it's slower than an intervene-first-think-later approach.\n\nBut if we're going to stop using screens, let's do it based on sound evidence.\n\nFacebook's new certainty: Uncertainty\n\n\"I know that we don't exactly have the strongest reputation on privacy right now, to put it lightly,\" Mark Zuckerberg told the crowd at Facebook's annual developer conference on Tuesday, a smile on his face. He paused, perhaps expecting laughter.\n\nThere was virtual silence.\n\nHe pushed on, describing a new, more private Facebook -- a bid to overcome the privacy and data scandals that have dogged his company. My colleague Mike Isaac explained what this would look like: more sharing in private groups, ephemeral content and encryption by default on messaging services.\n\nSounds promising! So why the silence? One reason, excepting Mr. Zuckerberg's delivery, was panic.\n\nFacebook is entering uncharted territory, and Mr. Zuckerberg isn't sure what the future looks like, according to an interview he gave to The Washington Post. Here are some takeaways:\n\n\u25a0 His business plan is hazy. \"I don't know how good of a business it will be, but I am confident it will be good,\" Mr. Zuckerberg said.\n\n\u25a0 He can't say how long the pivot will take. \"The next five years at least, maybe even the next 10 years, is building out the private platforms with the richness that the public platforms have had to date,\" he said.\n\n\u25a0 And impending regulation from all corners, perhaps the biggest threat to Facebook's future, is largely beyond its control.\n\nThe developers listening to Mr. Zuckerberg were aware of this, and the upheaval that the shift could cause them. Excuse them for not laughing.\n\nWhat keeps Uber up at night?\n\nUber spent the week on a roadshow, trying to persuade investors to buy its shares ahead of its initial public offering. As Mike Isaac reported, Uber's pitch draws parallels to Amazon: a do-anything juggernaut that will aggressively invest and diversify.\n\nInvestors have reportedly been asking hard questions about the rid-hailing company's growth, competition and market share. Which is reasonable, given that Uber dedicated 35,000 words in its I.P.O. prospectus to what could go wrong.\n\nHere are some of its biggest nightmares:\n\nEmployees. Uber labels its drivers contractors, not employees, to avoid paying a minimum wage. More than 60,000 drivers have filed or plan to file for arbitration to change that, a shift that could cost it billions of dollars. (It will be heartened by the Labor Department's recent decision to exempt an unspecified gig-economy company from that fate.)\n\nCompetitors' autonomous cars. Robo-cars are essential to Uber's profitability: They'll allow vehicles to offer rides 24-7 without human drivers, who currently share the takings. But if competitors like Waymo crack the technology first, Uber could be ruined.\n\nRegulation. It's 2019, and the authorities are after tech companies -- whether through outright blocks to Uber's taxi service or privacy regulations that crimp its ability to innovate.\n\nItself. For years, Uber was perhaps tech's biggest villain. It worries that its cultural and leadership fixes might not be enough to solve its lingering P.R. problems.\n\nAnd, um, restaurants and delivery companies? Uber's aggressive diversification means competitors are everywhere: Restaurants steal customers from its food delivery service, and companies like DHL compete with its freight service.\n\nAnd some stories you shouldn't miss\n\n\u25a0 Huawei has a culture problem. It seeks acceptance in the West, but its structure and value system -- shaped after the Communist Party's -- could stand in the way.\n\n\u25a0 Tech giants reported sliding financial results. Slumping iPhone sales shrank Apple's profit, and growth is faltering at Alphabet, Google's parent company.\n\n\u25a0 Border officials have designs on your devices. The American Civil Liberties Union found that two agencies -- Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- have \"near-unfettered authority to search and seize travelers' devices at the border.\"\n\n\u25a0 Sri Lanka's president lifted the nation's ban on social media. It was supposed to prevent the spread of misinformation after bombings on Easter.\n\n\u25a0 Drones: now delivering organs. One of the unmanned vehicles delivered a kidney last month to a Maryland woman who had waited eight years for a lifesaving transplant.\n\n\u25a0 I.P.O.s keep coming. Slack and WeWork are the latest tech unicorns to file paperwork for impending initial public offerings.\n\n\u25a0 Robots rule the roost at Amazon. The company dismissed the idea that robots would soon replace its warehouse workers, but machines are hiring and firing those employees.\n\n\u25a0 Qualcomm is getting at least $4.5 billion from Apple. That's the settlement from their lengthy patent battle.\n\nJamie Condliffe is editor of the DealBook newsletter. He also writes the weekly Bits newsletter.

Why Central European leaders are visiting the White House.", "body": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, center, arrives for a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, during the second Belt and Road Forum on April 25 in Beijing. President Trump has invited Orban to the White House on May 13. (Andrea Verdelli/AFP/Getty Images) By Emily Tamkin Emily Tamkin Reporter covering foreign affairs May 2 at 1:43 PM\n\nA casual viewer of the White House's upcoming schedule might ask: \"Why are Central European leaders getting invited to descend on Washington this spring?\"\n\nLast month, President Trump hosted Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis at the White House. This Friday, he will do the same for Peter Pellegrini, prime minister of Slovakia. And later this month, on May 13, the U.S. president will host Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban -- his first visit to the White House since 2001. (The last of the prime ministers of the so-called Visegrad group, Poland's Mateusz Morawiecki, was supposed to visit Washington last month, but his visit got postponed.)\n\nThat the Central European leaders would eventually get a Trump meeting is not, in itself, so surprising. Since former assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia Wess Mitchell, who was confirmed in the fall of 2017, came on the scene, the Trump administration's approach to Central Europe has looked dramatically different than Obama's.\n\nThe Obama administration, critics say, largely overlooked the region, refusing to engage until its increasingly illiberal leaders improved on human rights. The Trump administration, with a policy shaped by Mitchell, chose to not focus on human rights and instead to engage the region to compete with and counter Russia and China. In Mitchell's last week on the job, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled through the region, literally announcing that they were going to engage in the region by competing with Moscow and Beijing.\n\n\"I think there is a growing concern in Washington about great power competition in Central Europe (which you touched on in your earlier piece), especially with China's Belt & Road, Huawei, etc. Following in Wess Mitchell's footsteps, the administration's idea is to engage, be present in Visegrad countries, and not rattle anybody's cage too much,\" Dalibor Rohac, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute focused on European politics, wrote in an email.\n\nBut the White House meetings aren't happening because the countries visited have done what Pompeo asked. On the contrary. Since Pompeo's trip to Central Europe, Hungary has moved ahead with plans to welcome in a Russian development bank, and the Czech president (who, it should be noted, does not control Czech foreign policy) went to China to meet with the head of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company that the Trump administration has been working to counter in Europe.\n\nAnd issues highlighted by the United States in Hungary-U. S. relations -- for example, the expulsion from Budapest of Central European University, the institute founded by Hungarian-born American billionaire George Soros and Hungary's diplomatic spat with Ukraine -- remain.\n\n\"[It's] clear [the policy of re-engagement] hasn't worked -- countries like Hungary and the Czech Republic continue to deepen their ties with Moscow and Beijing,\" wrote Christopher Maroshegyi, senior director at Albright Stonebridge Group.\n\nIn addition to welcoming the Russian development bank and giving it diplomatic immunity, Hungary has also welcomed Huawei.\n\n\"Huawei runs its largest logistics center outside of China in Budapest and in a meeting with Huawei in April Hungary's Finance Minister said they would roll out Huawei equipment across the country,\" Maroshegyi wrote. Hungary has done one thing the Trump administration asked, or at least has said it will: Hungarian officials are reportedly negotiating a \"high-value arms deal\" with the U.S. government.\n\nBut the White House visits aren't, or aren't just, about trying once again to use Russia and China as leverage, nor are they just about arms deal money, experts say.\n\n\"The goal of the visits seems more likely aimed at deepening Trump's club of autocratic leaders and shoring up populist leaders ahead of European [Parliament] elections on May 23,\" Maroshegyi wrote. \"Otherwise it's hard to justify inviting such a controversial leader [as Orban] that is trying to raise his international profile to the White House just weeks ahead of a pivotal election.\"\n\nThe Visegrad leaders, like Trump, are outspokenly opposed to immigration and ardent nationalists. Orban has said that the upcoming European Parliament elections will be about the issue. \"We will decide whether to defend our Christian European culture or yield the terrain to multiculturalism,\" he told members and supporters of his party, Fidesz.\n\n\"I think Pompeo's visit to Budapest made a difference in detoxifying Hungary -- Orban made a big impression on him and they're seeing him now as an important European player who'll only grow in influence after the European election,\" said Rohac.\n\nAnd so Orban is coming to the White House. And the other, less controversial but still generally anti-immigrant leaders of Central Europe are, too.\n\nThe twist is that some in Central Europe don't appreciate being painted with the same brush: They may all take a hard line on immigration, but Hungary and Poland have run afoul of the European Union, and Hungary has even launched an anti-Brussels campaign.\n\n\"My hope is that Pellegrini can help de-homogenize Visegrad at his meeting with Trump tomorrow: affirm that Slovakia sees its place in Europe very differently from [Poland's Law and Justice] and Fidesz and also tell Trump that Central Europeans in general do not appreciate the administration's attitude toward the EU,\" wrote Rohac, who is originally from Slovakia.\n\n\"But I wouldn't bet on it.\"\n\nIt is, after all, the perceived ideological sameness that has likely helped get them, one by one, to the White House.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fIfh_d21X43bUjn0iRXAa88vJvw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4ZHVPZTHP4I6TJUYFKHYBDE47M.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4766718", "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 294516120}, {"uri": "1126673648", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-02", "time": "17:57:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-02T17:57:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5882353186607361, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/world/europe/uk-defense-secretary-leaks-daily-telegraph.html", "title": "Firing of Britain's Defense Secretary Raises Question: What Is a Leak?", "body": "LONDON -- After dismissing her defense secretary on accusations he leaked sensitive information, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain declared the matter \"closed,\" and on Thursday her government insisted that the police need not investigate one of the most serious security breaches in recent memory.\n\nBut the former defense secretary, Gavin Williamson, is not going quietly. In a series of interviews, he has sworn that he was not the source of the leak from the National Security Council reported in a Daily Telegraph article. He has demanded a police inquiry to vindicate him and accused one of the country's top civil servants of having conducted a vendetta.\n\nHis protestations of innocence have raised questions not only about Mrs. May's notoriously leaky cabinet, but also about how information is traded between Britain's top politicians and its leading journalists and the nature of a leak.\n\nMr. Williamson has not denied reports that he spoke by phone to the author of the article, the Daily Telegraph's deputy political editor, Steven Swinford, for 11 minutes on the day of the leak -- apparently the main evidence against him. Instead, Mr. Williamson seems to be arguing that the conversation was not responsible for the leak that has cost him job.\n\nThe episode has put a spotlight on a murky zone within Britain's fiercely competitive news media environment. There, political scoops are more often produced from sources that confirm stories with nods, winks or \"nondenials,\" rather than by handing over documents or making clear statements of fact.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Tom Newton Dunn, political editor of The Sun, speculated that any exchange of information would likely have been vague, and the conversation cloaked in an informal Westminster code.\n\n\"You don't ring up a minister and say, 'Will you leak this to me?' You say to him, 'Look, if I was to write, and I think that this happened, would I look particularly silly?' Mr. Newton Dunn explained.\n\nThe answer could come back, \"I don't think you look silly, Tom, at the best of times,\" or \"You do look particularly silly much of the time,\" said Mr. Newton Dunn, adding: \"That's the code. And that's how it would have happened.\"\n\nIn a Twitter thread, Gaby Hinsliff, a columnist and former political editor of The Observer, described the piecemeal way in which snippets of information are bounced around several sources to build a bigger picture.\n\n\"A little bit of info from lots of people who in each case don't think they really told you anything much -- quite a sizable stone sometimes,\" Ms. Hinsliff wrote.\n\nIn this way there can often be no one source of a leak, but several, all of whom can deny responsibility. Whether Mr. Williamson was one of those sources is now hotly contested.\n\nFiercely ambitious -- to his critics, gaffe-prone and self-promoting -- Mr. Williamson lost his job on Wednesday after being accused of a leak that suggested that Mrs. May would give a role in designing a British telecommunications network to Huawei, a Chinese company considered a security risk by the United States.\n\nThe report in the Daily Telegraph suggested that Mrs. May had overruled objections from some senior council members, including Mr. Williamson, about allowing Huawei to build some elements of the next-generation cellular data network known as 5G.\n\nAlthough the government says that no decision has yet been taken formally, the leak seems accurate enough to have infuriated Mrs. May who, when she ran for the leadership of her party in 2016, made a point about straight-dealing and her refusal to gossip with journalists in the bars of Parliament.\n\nThe leak also outraged senior civil servants, including the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, and caused friction with the United States. The Trump administration has asserted that Huawei's technology -- already widely installed in earlier generation systems in Europe -- could provide a \"backdoor\" for Chinese intelligence -- something the company has denied.\n\nMr. Williamson's ignominious dismissal is the latest crisis to engulf a cabinet so bitterly divided over Britain's withdrawal from the European Union that it was recently chastised by the chief whip, Julian Smith, for having displayed the \"worst example of ill-discipline in cabinet in British political history.\"\n\nOn Thursday, opposition parties joined Mr. Williamson in demanding a police investigation, and the Metropolitan Police commissioner, Cressida Dick, said her officers would \"look at any complaint.\" But she said under existing protocols the police needed a referral from the government. None had yet been received.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament, David Lidington, Mrs. May's de facto deputy, argued that a referral was not necessary, suggesting that Mr. Williamson is not being accused formally of breaking the official secrecy laws that senior ministers promise to obey.\n\n\"The issue at stake here was less the substance of the material that was disclosed than the principle of a leak from the National Security Council itself,\" said Mr. Lidington.\n\nEssentially, the government's argument is that the leak of anything discussed at such a confidential meeting puts at risk the functioning of the council, because it is attended by Britain's top intelligence officials who expect secrecy.\n\nMr. Williamson also was accused by the government of being less cooperative than other ministers with the leak inquiry, though it did not elaborate.\n\nDespite Mrs. May's lost confidence in Mr. Williamson, the government seems reluctant to try to prove Mr. Williamson's guilt.\n\nOn Thursday Mr. Lidington argued that the former defense secretary's overall conduct was at issue, and that makes Mrs. May \"the ultimate judge of the standards of behavior expected of a minister.\"\n\nIn an apparent dig at Mr. Williamson, Mr. Lidington added that after meetings of the National Security Council, ministers should \"shut up.\"\n\nThat appeared to echo Mr. Williamson's much-ridiculed words last year when he said that Russia should \"go away and shut up.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_castle@nytimes.com", "name": "Stephen Castle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/02/world/02britain1/02britain1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4761664", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 294515820}, {"uri": "1126535427", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-02", "time": "14:48:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-02T14:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2019/05/02/daily-202-amy-klobuchar-s-home-field-advantage-in-iowa/5cc9cbf81ad2e506550b2ed7/", "title": "The Daily 202: Amy Klobuchar's home-field advantage in Iowa", "body": "STORM LAKE, Iowa -- If Joe Biden fails to catch fire in Iowa on his third try for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Amy Klobuchar will be well positioned to make inroads with the kinds of voters who might otherwise back the former vice president.\n\nThe senator from Minnesota has been getting a more positive reception in the Hawkeye State than has been reflected in the polls, where she's in the back of the pack, or in the national media's coverage, which has focused more on candidates like Biden, Bernie Sanders and Beto O'Rourke.\n\n\"While there's a lot of attention on the B's right now, I would like to remind people that A comes before B and A will win out in the long term,\" Klobuchar joked during an interview last night. \"It just gives me time, with all the attention on these guys, to keep building steady support. And I note that Jimmy Carter and a number of other people were underdogs at this point in the race.\"\n\nBiden wrapped up his first foray into Iowa last night with a rally in Des Moines. Klobuchar will return to the state this weekend for her sixth trip since she launched her campaign in February. She will convene roundtable discussions on Saturday in Des Moines and Iowa City to discuss combating substance abuse and prioritizing mental health. And she'll host meet-and-greets near the campuses of Grinnell College and the University of Iowa.\n\n-- One thing Klobuchar has going for her is that she represents a neighboring state, which allows her to speak in a way that resonates with Iowans. Seven of Iowa's northern counties are in the Rochester, Minn., media market, which means folks see about as much news about Minneapolis as Des Moines. She can also talk in minute detail about the Minnesota Twins, one of the three baseball teams that Iowans tend to root for.\n\n\"It's helpful because there's people that know who I am, especially in the northern part. But I think it's more that I understand the people in Iowa,\" Klobuchar explained during an extended interview in Storm Lake last month. \"I understand what their issues are. That isn't an immediate gain; it's a long-term gain.\"\n\nKlobuchar said that a surprising number of Iowans have approached her to say that they checked with relatives or friends who live in Minnesota to ask how she's been as a senator before they came to see her speak -- and that her constituents have vouched for her job performance. \"Before they go to an event, they'll call their cousin in Burnsville and ask, 'What do you know about her?' Literally, people are coming up all the time and saying that,\" Klobuchar said. \"Because of the fact that I have a lot of support in my state, and in rural areas, I think that will have a long-term benefit.\"\n\nThis is certainly not going to be determinative, but it does offer a boost. Having a home-field advantage helps sports teams, of course, but they'll still lose games even when they're playing before a friendly crowd.\n\n-- Klobuchar also has a track record of winning the same kinds of Iowa voters who backed Barack Obama twice, when he carried Iowa, but then broke for Donald Trump in 2016. \"I have a very strong case to make about how I am able to get independent and moderate Republican votes,\" she said. \"The Democrats in Iowa get that it's not easy to win these elections, and that to win in states like ours you have to get some independent votes.\"\n\nNo Republican has carried Minnesota in a presidential election since Richard Nixon in 1972, but Trump came unexpectedly close. Hillary Clinton carried the Land of 10,000 Lakes with less than 47 percent, besting Trump by 1.5 percentage points, or about 44,000 votes. \"It was Hillary's smallest margin, and in fact she got a lower percentage of the vote than she did in four states she lost, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and Michigan,\" said Klobuchar. \"Then I think she won only because some of the moderate Republicans voted for [Libertarian Gary] Johnson because, as you know, they like that name.\"\n\nThis is a joke Minnesotans will get. The state is chock-full of people with the surname Johnson. They're everywhere.\n\n-- Klobuchar won her third term in November with 60 percent of the vote, beating her GOP challenger by 24 points, or 626,000 votes. Klobuchar won 42 counties in 2018 that Trump had won in 2016. Of those, 39 are in rural areas. (Minnesota has 87 counties.) Riding her coattails, Democrats flipped the state House and picked up two U.S. House seats in the suburbs of the Twin Cities that have long been held by Republicans. Klobuchar has consistently fared well in outlying areas. She's carried all eight of Minnesota's congressional districts in all three of her Senate campaigns, including the one previously represented by Republican Michele Bachmann.\n\n\"I visit every county every year in Minnesota, and that's one of my things: I go not just where it's comfortable but where it's uncomfortable,\" she said. \"That means people are going to ask critical questions here and there when they don't agree with something, but then they're going to find some common ground. That's what I've been doing here in Iowa.\"\n\nKlobuchar added that she's not putting all her eggs in the Iowa basket. She also hired staffers in New Hampshire and campaigned in Nevada last weekend.\n\n-- Klobuchar was in the national spotlight yesterday during Bill Barr's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss Bob Mueller's report. She pressed the attorney general on his conclusion that the president didn't obstruct justice. She walked through the 10 episodes of possible obstruction in the Mueller report. \"You look at the totality of the evidence,\" Klobuchar said. \"That's what I learned when I was in law school.\" Barr replied, \"There's ample evidence on the other side of the ledger.\"\n\nKlobuchar was one of three presidential candidates to question Barr, in addition to Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey. She said after the hearing that Barr should resign. \"I've always thought that he should step down,\" Klobuchar explained. \"I never supported him to begin with, and everything that's happened has been consistent with my views that I put forth back during his confirmation hearing, that his expansive view of executive power was the worst thing the country needs right now when we have a president that needs a check and balance, and that is more true in how he handled this report and his statements today.\"\n\n-- Klobuchar also used the hearing to criticize the White House's maneuvering to quash the Secure Elections Act during the last Congress, which she co-sponsored with Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) and which would mandate backup paper ballots. Klobuchar said that former White House counsel Don McGahn called around to GOP senators to get them to oppose the measure and asked Barr whether he'll back her plan when she reintroduces it. \"Otherwise, we are not going to have any clout to get backup paper ballots if something goes wrong in this election,\" the senator said. Barr responded that he does not know about the bill, but he pledged to work with her \"on securing our elections.\"\n\n-- In Iowa, Klobuchar has been touting her commitment to bipartisanship, but she said she doesn't consider herself a moderate. \"People can call me whatever they want, as long as they call me a winner,\" she said. \"I don't really care, but I think it's important to note that I'm a proven progressive and that I've gotten things done.\"\n\nThe senator has been willing to say \"no\" to some of the purity tests being pushed by far-left activists, which has been a rare quality in this environment. Klobuchar has expressed skepticism of packing the Supreme Court, for example, and she's said that her rivals promising free tuition to universities and college debt forgiveness aren't being straight with voters. On health care, Klobuchar endorses a public option but stops short of Medicare-for-all.\n\n-- A big part of Klobuchar's theory of the case is that she can bridge the urban-rural divide that has bedeviled Democrats lately. \"Yeah, I'm going to reach out to our base, and I know I'm in an incredibly competitive primary, but it's just not me if I don't also try to bridge that divide with rural voters,\" she said.\n\nShe rolled out a trillion-dollar infrastructure proposal during a March swing across rural eastern Iowa. \"There's no such thing as a Democratic or Republican bridge,\" she said. \"There are just bridges.\"\n\nKlobuchar said showing up is important, but it's also important to lay out an optimistic economic agenda and not get distracted by divisive cultural issues when Trump talks about them. Klobuchar also tries to use humor. When she announced her candidacy outdoors as it was snowing, Trump called her a \"snow woman\" on Twitter. Klobuchar replied: \"I'd like to see how your hair would fare in a blizzard.\"\n\n-- Klobuchar said she thinks the televised town halls by the cable channels this year will wind up being equally as important as the debates, which will be split across two nights and where the massive numbers of candidates on the stage will make it hard for anyone to get a word in edgewise. Fox News will broadcast an hour-long town hall with Klobuchar live from Milwaukee on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. Eastern. Sanders is the only other Democrat who has gotten the platform thus far, and 2.6 million people tuned in. Pete Buttigieg, who appears on the cover of next week's Time magazine, has a Fox town hall on the books for May 19.\n\n-- Klobuchar works very hard to cultivate a brand as down-home and down-to-earth. \"The Senator Next Door\" was the title of her 2015 memoir. But she's also indisputably one of the smartest candidates running to be president. She went to Yale for undergrad, where she wrote an astute senior thesis on the politics behind the public financing of the Metrodome stadium. It was published as a book in 1986 and holds up well three decades later. Then she went to the University of Chicago for law school, where Jim Comey was a classmate.\n\n-- Klobuchar was the first woman elected to the Senate from Minnesota. The state still hasn't elected a woman as governor. I've encountered a surprisingly significant number of female voters at Democratic events recently, including town halls for female presidential candidates, who have volunteered without any prompting during interviews that they're not sure whether it makes sense to nominate another woman to take on Trump after Clinton's defeat. I asked Klobuchar about this dynamic and, more broadly, whether she feels she's experienced more misogyny in rural areas than the suburbs or urban centers.\n\n\"I wouldn't call it misogyny, ever,\" the senator replied. \"I think that it is people that want to win, and they're just trying to game it out basically and figure it out. I don't agree with the assessment, but I wouldn't call it misogyny. I would say that they are so focused on beating Donald Trump, and they are trying to figure out who the best person is for that. It's that simple.\"\n\nKlobuchar noted that women won many of the most exciting victories for Democrats in the midterms in red states with large rural populations. She pointed out that Laura Kelly defeated Kris Kobach in the Kansas governor's race. Democratic women also picked up two of Iowa's four U.S. House seats in the midterms, defeating Republican incumbents in districts that Trump had carried two years earlier. Abby Finkenauer, 30, ousted Rod Blum in the northeast district that includes her hometown of Dubuque. Cindy Axne, 54, toppled David Young in the southwestern district that includes Council Bluffs.\n\n\"It's a thing. They supported a woman for president before. But the answer is right in front of them, with Cindy and Abby in their own state,\" said Klobuchar. \"You have to make the case that a woman can win and is perhaps ... actually a good bet against Donald Trump, depending on who the woman is. What I think you don't want to have be your whole theme is, 'Oh, we have to put a woman in the White House.' I don't think that's going to work for voters when they just want to win. What works is if you're able to show your strength, and you're able to show that you do well against him. We had a Michigan poll that showed Biden and I were the two strongest candidates against Trump.\"\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) announced this morning on CBS that he is running for president. He is the 21st Democrat to declare a candidacy. Michael Scherer reports: \"Bennet announced in April that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. After surgery, he reported that it had been successful and he had no need for further treatment. 'My plan is to run for president,' Bennet said on CBS, adding that he will focus on issues including health care, economic mobility and the 'need to restore integrity to our government.' Bennet emphasized his track record of bipartisan legislation in Washington and said he would stand out among Democrats because of his ability to tell the truth, his record of winning elections in a 'purple' state like Colorado and his history of turning around failing businesses in the private sector.\"\n\n-- Soon there will be 22: Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) plans to announce his White House bid during the week of May 13. The two-term governor can't run for reelection in 2020 because of term limits, and he has rejected Sen. Chuck Schumer's recruitment efforts to get him to challenge Sen. Steve Daines (R). So he's got nothing to lose. (KTVH)\n\n-- Barr dismissed Mueller's letter complaining about his handling of the special counsel's report as \"snitty\" and refused to give any ground. Devlin Barrett, Matt Zapotosky, Karoun Demirjian and Rosalind S. Helderman report: \"The attorney general parried many of the Democrats' toughest accusations and questions with avuncular answers about legal definitions and Justice Department policy, exasperating lawmakers like Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who accused Barr of 'masterful hairsplitting.' ... After the hearing ended, Justice Department officials notified the House Judiciary Committee that Barr would not appear at a planned Thursday hearing to discuss the Trump investigation. That session had been in doubt over objections by Barr's aides that he would be questioned by staff lawyers for the committee. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec blamed the cancellation on 'unprecedented and unnecessary' conditions demanded by the committee's Democratic chairman, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York.\"\n\n-- Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters after the hearing that he will not call Mueller to testify. (Watch the video.)\n\n-- Barr's refusal to appear before the House Judiciary Committee increases the likelihood he will be held in contempt of Congress, especially after the AG blew off the panel's subpoena deadline to review the unredacted Mueller report. Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian report: \"Nadler said he would give Barr a 'day or two' to turn over the full, unredacted Mueller report in accordance with the committee's subpoena -- information that was due Wednesday morning. But the chairman warned that 'if good-faith negotiations don't result in a pledge of compliance .\u2009.\u2009. the next step is seeking a contempt citation against the attorney general.' ... On Wednesday night, in a letter to the committee explaining the ignored subpoena, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd argued that Nadler's move to compel the DOJ to turn over the unredacted Mueller report 'is not legitimate oversight.'\"\n\n-- The White House said it will refuse to authorize any executive branch officials to provide a House committee with details on individual security clearances. Tom Hamburger, Rachael Bade and Josh Dawsey report: \"House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) called [the move] 'the latest example of the president's widespread and growing obstruction of Congress.' The oversight panel has been examining the administration's handling of security clearances and allegations that officials, including presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner, were granted access to sensitive information over the objections of career staffers. ... On Wednesday, White House Counsel Pat A. Cipollone escalated the fight, writing to Cummings that his 'committee appears to be putting public servants at risk' as it seeks information on how the White House granted security clearances to Kushner and others in the White House. Cummings rejected Cipollone's arguments and accused the administration of taking on the trappings of monarchy.\"\n\n-- House Democrats denounced Trump's lawsuit to block compliance with a subpoena for his financial records as a grave threat to congressional oversight. Spencer S. Hsu reports: \"In a 34-page answer to the lawsuit, filed April 22 by Trump against [Cummings] and Trump's accounting firm, lawyers for Cummings urged a federal judge to reject the president's request to temporarily block the subpoena while the case proceeds. Ruling for Trump 'would directly impede ongoing congressional investigations of national importance and threaten the constitutional system that separates and divides power between the branches of government,' lawyers for the House panel wrote.\"\n\n-- Mar-a-Lago sent the federal government a $1,000 bill in April 2017 after a group of White House staffers served themselves top-shelf liquor from the resort's bar. ProPublica's Derek Kravitz has a very important story based on documents obtained via an open records lawsuit. \"The group asked the bartender to leave the room so it 'could speak confidentially,' according to an email written by Mar-a-Lago's catering director, Brooke Watson. The Secret Service guarded the door, according to the email. The bartender wasn't allowed to return. And members of the group began pouring themselves drinks. No one paid. Six days later, on April 13, Mar-a-Lago created a bill for those drinks, tallying $838 worth of alcohol plus a 20% service charge. ... The unusual cocktail hour underscores a unique push and pull in the current administration: Donald Trump's White House pays a bill and Donald Trump's club reaps the revenue. ... Emails show that the president's company refused to agree to what was essentially a bulk-purchase agreement with the federal government, and that it charged the maximum allowable federal rate for hotel rooms.\" The White House, the State Department and the Trump Organization all declined to comment.\n\n-- Has Trump found his new Roy Cohn? By aggressively downplaying the president's efforts to get former White House counsel Don McGahn to remove Mueller, Barr often looked more like Trump's defense attorney than the nation's chief law enforcement officer. Carol Leonnig reports: \"In Barr's telling ... Trump may have merely been trying to correct media reports he believed were inaccurate. He cited the president's public explanations of his behavior -- even though the president refused to provide testimony about it under oath. And he discounted as weak the case that Trump's actions were part of a criminal effort to thwart a federal investigation -- despite the fact that Mueller said in his report that 'substantial evidence' indicated the president was acting to prevent scrutiny of his conduct in the obstruction inquiry. ... In a day of sometimes prickly testimony, the focus on Barr's view of the McGahn episode provided the most revealing look yet at Barr's rationale for determining there was not sufficient evidence to charge Trump with trying to thwart the probe.\"\n\n-- Barr's hearing underscored how Mueller's by-the-book silence has enabled Trump and his allies to cast the probe's findings in the most favorable light possible for the president. Greg Miller explains: \"In particular, the attorney general downplayed or dismissed the evidence assembled by Mueller that Trump could be guilty of obstructing justice. And he emphasized that Mueller found no proof of collusion between Russia and Trump or his associates. ... Mueller's reverence for the rule of law and rigid adherence to protocol have bolstered the credibility of the Russia report. ... But the special counsel's deference to procedure and bureaucratic authority has also enabled Trump and his allies to dominate the debate over the investigation's results.\"\n\n-- Former FBI director Jim Comey argues in a stinging op-ed that Barr, as well as outgoing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, have been co-opted by Trump's \"amoral\" leadership. Comey writes in the New York Times: \"Amoral leaders have a way of revealing the character of those around them. Sometimes what they reveal is inspiring. ... But more often, proximity to an amoral leader reveals something depressing. I think that's at least part of what we've seen with Bill Barr and Rod Rosenstein. Accomplished people lacking inner strength can't resist the compromises necessary to survive Mr. Trump and that adds up to something they will never recover from. It takes character like [former defense secretary Jim] Mattis's to avoid the damage, because Mr. Trump eats your soul in small bites.\"\n\n-- Comey agreed to appear in a CNN town hall on May 9, the two-year anniversary of his firing. (CNN)\n\n-- How the hearing is playing:\n\n-- Hillary Clinton suggested hypothetically that, if the Justice Department was going to let Russia interference in the 2016 election go unpunished, China should get Trump's tax returns to help the 2020 Democratic nominee. Politico's Bianca Quilantan reports: \"The 2016 Democratic presidential candidate offered a seemingly tongue-in-cheek hypothetical to Rachel Maddow on her MSNBC show. ... 'Why should Russia have all the fun? And since Russia is clearly backing Republicans, why don't we ask China to back us? ... And not only that, China, if you're listening, why don't you get Trump's tax returns?' Clinton [said]. 'I'm sure our media would richly reward you.'\"\n\nTHE GROWING CHINA THREAT:\n\n-- Former CIA case officer Jerry Lee pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiring to commit espionage for China. But Lee's sentence will likely be significantly shorter than previously expected because the guilty plea he entered describes the information he divulged as \"secret\" rather than \"top secret,\" even though U.S. intelligence officials still believe the former agent is responsible for compromising and betraying CIA sources in China. (Rachel Weiner and Shane Harris)\n\n-- Chinese authorities are compiling a database tracking the locations of their citizens, their mobile app usage, religious habits and even their electricity consumption. It's all part of a crackdown on an estimated 1 million Muslim citizens. Gerry Shih has an alarming report: \"In the last two years, a growing body of testimony by former Xinjiang residents and a trove of government procurement documents, directives and state media reports have painted a picture of oppression in the region, where Chinese authorities have relied on far-reaching electronic surveillance to help dictate its mass internment program. ... After denying their existence for a year, Chinese authorities have recently argued that Xinjiang's network of detention centers are built for educating and de-radicalizing a Muslim population that became increasingly influenced by extremist Islamic ideology.\"\n\n-- A federal judge in Washington ordered three Chinese banks partly or wholly owned by the government to turn over documents as part of a probe into the evasion of sanctions on North Korea. Spencer S. Hsu reports: \"A March 18 opinion unsealed late Tuesday by Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell marked the first known instance in which a U.S. court has upheld subpoenas to a Chinese bank in a sanctions probe. ... Records capturing 'cash deposits .\u2009.\u2009. intrabank transfers and foreign currency deposits' that can be used to launder money through the United States 'are precisely the type that the statute permits the government to subpoena,' wrote Howell.\"\n\n-- British Prime Minister Theresa May has just fired her defense secretary after he allegedly played a role in leaking details from a meeting about Britain's ties to the Chinese tech giant Huawei. Karla Adam and William Booth report: \"The abrupt sacking of Britain's top defense official -- over allegations by the prime minister that [Gavin] Williamson had breached the secrecy protocols of the National Security Council -- was stunning. For a top government minister to be canned over such a leak is almost unprecedented in Britain. Williamson denied any involvement in the unauthorized disclosure. ... After an April 23 meeting of Britain's National Security Council, attended by intelligence chiefs and senior cabinet ministers, a story appeared on the front page of the Daily Telegraph that claimed May had decided to permit Huawei to play a leading role in building Britain's 5G Internet -- despite intense pressure from the United States to ban Huawei as a security risk.\"\n\n-- China has dubiously declared itself a \"near-Arctic power\" in a bid to encroach on what's long been an American sphere of influence. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps promise to push back with a show of force. The Wall Street Journal's Ben Kesling reports: \"Navy Secretary Richard Spencer said the service would undertake extensive Arctic operations this summer and fall, while the Marine Corps commandant said that Marines are committed to training in Alaska to an extent not seen in decades. ... As the Arctic opens up to greater navigation [because of climate change], major powers are vying for supremacy over areas previously locked under ice.\"\n\n-- A Chinese family allegedly paid $6.5 million to secure their daughter's admission to Stanford as part of the college admissions fraud scandal. The family of Yusi Zhao, a Chinese national who was admitted to Stanford as a sailing recruit even though there are no indications she ever sailed, met Rick Singer through a Morgan Stanley financial adviser. Her family has not yet been charged in the case and denies wrongdoing, but she has been expelled by Stanford. (Los Angeles Times)\n\n-- Some American politicians appear unwilling to acknowledge the Chinese threat. Joe Biden even said in Iowa last night that China is \"not competition for us.\" Felicia Sonmez reports: \"At a campaign stop in Iowa City, Biden pointed to his years serving as vice president and as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, telling the crowd that there's not a 'single solitary' world leader who would trade the problems the United States faces for those confronting China. 'China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man,' said Biden ... His comments drew a swift rebuke from Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), the GOP's 2012 presidential nominee. 'This will not age well,' Romney said.\"\n\nMORE ON THE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Thousands of demonstrators showed up to support Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the opposition tried to regain momentum in the campaign to oust President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Anthony Faiola, Mariana Zu\u00f1iga and Mary Beth Sheridan report: \"Yet the chaotic events of the day before -- which began with Guaid\u00f3's calling for a peaceful insurrection by the military and ended with few takers and Maduro still in the presidential palace -- left opposition supporters grappling with a sense of a pivotal moment lost. Many in the ranks remained resolute after a day of violence that left one man dead, dozens injured and more detained. But there were also strains of confusion and disappointment. ... Senior opposition leaders spent part of the day Wednesday explaining their tactics to others in the movement, many of whom had been left in the dark about Guaid\u00f3's high-stakes bid ... Guaid\u00f3 and the Trump administration had hoped this week would be a turning point in the three-month-long effort to remove Maduro.\"\n\n-- But the opposition's plan seems to have failed, for now. Karen DeYoung, Josh Dawsey and Paul Sonne report: \"The Trump administration publicly blamed Russia and Cuba -- Maduro's top backers -- for keeping him in place and discouraging expected high-level defections. On Wednesday, as the United States and Russia traded barbs, the White House held an emergency meeting of top national security aides to mull next steps. 'Significant progress on defense matters' was made, a senior administration official said. Throughout the day, however, there were mixed messages about what role, if any, the U.S. military would play in Washington's future efforts to resolve the Venezuelan crisis.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, thinks national security adviser John Bolton \"wants to get him into wars.\" From Karen, Josh and Paul: \"Bolton has angered some within and outside the White House. Even before Tuesday's events, his staff clashed with Gen. Paul Selva, Dunford's vice chairman, during a meeting to address the ongoing Venezuelan crisis, according to several officials with knowledge of the exchange. The soft-spoken Air Force general was giving an update last week on the Pentagon's view and making the case against a risky escalation by the United States when Bolton aides, including Mauricio Claver-Carone, Western Hemisphere director at the National Security Council, repeatedly interrupted and asked for military options, according to the officials. Selva, irritated at the interruptions and confrontational style rather than the substance of any disagreement, slammed his hand down on the table, his ring hitting the wood with a sharp crack. Bolton deputy Charles Kupperman, who was chairing the meeting, adjourned the session earlier than planned, said the officials, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\"\n\n-- About 50 Americans have been living inside the Venezuelan Embassy in D.C. for three weeks, and now, Venezuelan demonstrators say they want the embassy back. Marissa J. Lang reports: \"On one side, a group of activists from Code Pink and other left-wing organizations have been living inside the embassy since April 10 at the invitation of the Maduro government. On Tuesday, they sat on the embassy steps and sang American protest songs, holding yellow signs that read 'No to U.S. coup plots' and 'Hands off Venezuela!' On the other side of the barricades, pro-opposition demonstrators decked out in yellow, red and blue filled the streets. They chanted, 'libertad,' meaning 'freedom,' and sang the Venezuelan national anthem.\"\n\n-- Trump and his administration are trying to salvage support for his NAFTA rewrite, which has received bipartisan blowback. Erica Werner and Damian Paletta report: \"White House officials have said that Trump really wants the Canada-Mexico trade deal to be successful and that he knows he needs support from Democrats to achieve this. ... Trump's new courtship of Democrats on trade came as he is simultaneously trying to prevent Republicans from bolting. A number of Republicans have objected to Trump's hardball tactics in the trade talks and want him to start offering Canada and Mexico immediate concessions. ... White House officials have signaled they want the Canada-Mexico trade deal to be completed by the end of this year, before election-year politics overwhelm Washington in 2020.\"\n\nMORE ON 2020:\n\n-- Biden is facing mounting conflict of interest questions that are being promoted by Trump and his allies over the ousting of a Ukrainian prosecutor general he once said was corrupt -- and who had opened a case into a company that was paying Hunter Biden. The New York Times's Ken Vogel and Iuliia Mendel report: \"The broad outlines of how the Bidens' roles intersected in Ukraine have been known for some time. The former vice president's campaign said that he had always acted to carry out United States policy without regard to any activities of his son, that he had never discussed the matter with Hunter Biden and that he learned of his son's role with the Ukrainian energy company from news reports. But new details about Hunter Biden's involvement, and a decision this year by the current Ukrainian prosecutor general to reverse himself and reopen an investigation into Burisma, have pushed the issue back into the spotlight just as the senior Mr. Biden is beginning his 2020 presidential campaign.\"\n\n-- Biden has already benefited from the extensive donor network that Obama built during his two presidential elections. Hours after launching his campaign last week, the former vice president raised about $700,000 from a fundraiser held at a Comcast executive's Philadelphia home. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \"But his approach also serves as a test of whether Democratic voters, wary of the political influence of wealthy corporate interests, will be turned off by a candidate so openly courting big donors. Most of the other Democratic hopefuls have focused on attracting large numbers of smaller contributions from online donors. ... Biden's connections to wealthy donors could also place pressure on other Democrats to step up their big-money fundraising.\"\n\n-- Biden wants Trump to know that he's no socialist. Matt Viser reports: \"Biden's implicit argument to Democrats, in the meantime, is that he has embraced enough of the policies animating the party's ascendant left to make him acceptable as the standard-bearer -- but not enough to alienate the working-class voters the party desperately wants to win back in 2020. He has embraced raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, a posture that advances on Hillary Clinton's stutter-step approach to raising wages in 2016, and he has touted a plan to allow anyone to go to community college free. He also has spurned others, calling for improvements to the Affordable Care Act but declining to back a Medicare-for-all plan supported by many of his party's 2020 candidates.\"\n\n-- Biden said last night that Barr should resign, saying he's \"lost confidence\" in the attorney general. \"This is what happens when you get caught in this administration -- you get pulled down,\" Biden said. (KCCI)\n\n-- Biden also called for the U.S. to end its support to Saudi Arabia in its war in Yemen. Josh Rogin reports: \"Biden's decision to weigh in on the Yemen issue is a clear sign he plans to rely on his long experience and record on foreign policy as he lays his claim to the role of commander in chief. That means foreign policy will indeed be featured in the Democratic primary, something Biden's opponents within the party are already preparing for.\"\n\n-- Kamala Harris and Cory Booker are trying to become the consensus pick for African American voters by pitching two very different economic visions. The New York Times's Nick Corasaniti and Astead W. Herndon report: \"Mr. Booker's 'baby bonds' proposal calls for every child born in the United States to be given a $1,000 savings account that the government would fund annually on a tiered basis, depending on family income. The lump sum is presented when the child turns 18 and can only be used for education, investing in a business or buying a home. ... Ms. Harris's policy, called LIFT the Middle Class Act, would provide lower-income families up to $500 in monthly payments, on top of existing tax credits and public benefits.\"\n\n-- Reversing himself under pressure, Beto O'Rourke said he will take no donations from the fossil fuel sector. Any funds he raised from that sector that are over $200 will be returned. Texas is a big energy state, and O'Rourke has sometimes been an ally of the industry. (AP)\n\n-- Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.) won't challenge Sen. John Cornyn (R) for his Senate seat. The Texas Tribune's Abby Livingston and Patrick Svitek report: \"After repeated public signals that he was 'all but certain' to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, Castro, a San Antonio Democrat, has opted to run for reelection rather than pursue what would likely have been a bruising political battle. ... But Castro's decision first came to light earlier in the day, when he told a reporter that he's 'gonna pass' on the race to unseat Cornyn. That conversation with Castro was overheard by other media outlets on Cornyn's weekly conference call with the Texas media. The reporter apparently had not muted his line on the Cornyn call and was talking with Castro on a different line.\"\n\nTHE IMMIGRATION WARS ESCALATE:\n\n-- The White House sent Congress a $4.5 billion emergency spending request for border protection money. Erica Werner, Maria Sacchetti and Nick Miroff report: \"The request includes $3.3 billion for humanitarian assistance and $1.1 billion for border operations, and it represents a dramatic escalation of the administration's efforts to address the situation at the border. ... 'The situation becomes more dire each day,' White House acting budget director Russ Vought wrote in the request to congressional leaders. 'The migration flow and the resulting humanitarian crisis is rapidly overwhelming the ability of the Federal Government to respond.' ... Democrats responded with skepticism to the request, which comes as Trump prepares to run for reelection on a hard-line immigration agenda. It also arrives as Congress is in the midst of a fight over a different emergency spending bill, for disaster aid.\"\n\n-- In its plea for funds, the administration described migrants as vulnerable children and families requiring resources to \"sustain critical and lifesaving missions,\" a message that starkly conflicts with Trump's typical description of those seeking to immigrate as an \"invasion\" by criminals and gang members. David Nakamura reports: \"The sharp dichotomy between the president's rhetoric and the tone of his aides reflects how they are waging a battle on separate fronts -- one political and the other operational -- as the administration struggles to deal with a mounting humanitarian crisis at the U.S. border with Mexico.\"\n\n-- The U.S. immigration court system is facing a backlog of 850,000 cases with fewer than 450 judges nationwide to handle them. Nick Miroff and Maria Sacchetti report: \"Since Trump took office, the backlog has swelled by more than 200,000 cases. The president has grown so frustrated that he has been floating the idea of doing away with U.S. immigration courts, which are part of the Justice Department, not the judicial branch. 'We don't need a court system,' he told Fox Business Network anchor Maria Bartiromo this week. 'We have a court system that is -- has 900,000 cases behind it. In other words, they have a court which needs to hear 900,000 cases. How ridiculous is this?' He added, 'What we need is new laws that don't allow this, so when somebody comes in, we say: 'Sorry, you got to go out.'\"\n\n-- A 16-year-old Guatemalan boy who crossed the border without his parents died after spending several days at a Texas hospital. Maria Sacchetti reports: \"The teenager, who was not identified, had cleared initial health screenings after encountering U.S. officials at the border. But he deteriorated shortly after he arrived at the Casa Padre shelter, a converted Walmart housing approximately 1,400 minors in the border city of Brownsville, Tex. Officials have not released a cause of death, and the case remains under investigation. ... The boy was the third migrant child to die in federal custody in the past five months, as a soaring number of Central American families and unaccompanied minors have been trying to enter the United States via the southern border.\"\n\n-- Trump appears to think that his best hope for reelection is to once again make the race a referendum on the border, which inspired his proposals to radically overhaul asylum rules. Sean Sullivan, Josh Dawsey and Matt Viser report: \"Trump has repeatedly told White House aides that he won in 2016 because he was the strongest candidate on immigration -- and that no chant at his rallies is louder than 'Build the wall!' When he is underscoring his immigration stance and contrasting it with Democrats, current and former aides and associates said, Trump thinks he has the advantage.\"\n\nTHE REST OF TRUMP'S DOMESTIC AGENDA:\n\n-- The Trump administration may seek permanent renewal of the surveillance law that has allowed the NSA to gather and analyze Americans' phone records. Ellen Nakashima reports: \"The White House, these officials said, was prepared to issue a public statement calling on Congress to reauthorize in full Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which in the past has been the focus of heated debate over the acceptable bounds of government surveillance. The plan to issue a statement was put on hold, officials said, but it illustrates nonetheless where the administration stands on the contested issue of national security authority. ... The statute expires in mid-December, and the reported suspension of the phone records program had raised questions about whether the Trump administration would seek to renew it.\"\n\n-- DOJ offered its first full argument in court for fully invalidating the Affordable Care Act. CNN's Ariane de Vogue reports: \"The government argues in the filings that the so-called 'individual mandate' requiring Americans to have coverage is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law should therefore also be struck down, even if the government 'might support some individual provisions as a policy matter.' ... In the filing, Assistant Attorney General Joseph Hunt acknowledged that the administration had previously argued that parts of the law could remain in effect even if the individual mandate were struck down, but he said, the administration had come to believe it could no longer defend that position.\"\n\n-- Senior Republicans, including the Senate majority whip, acknowledged that Stephen Moore appears unlikely to win confirmation to the Federal Reserve Board. Seung Min Kim reports: \"Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) has already said she probably would oppose him, while several other GOP senators have expressed concerns and have privately indicated they prefer he never be officially nominated. Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said in an interview Wednesday that he expects more information about Moore's fate by the end of the week and that trying to confirm him in the Senate, where Republicans control 53 votes, would be a 'very heavy lift.' ... Two GOP senators familiar with party dynamics ... said they expect either Moore to withdraw or the White House to cancel his pending nomination by either Thursday or Friday.\"\n\n-- A new Senate GOP offer on the disaster aid bill would send $300 million more to Puerto Rico in an attempt to break a standoff. Erica Werner reports: \"A key Democrat reacted positively Wednesday, in an optimistic sign for prospects for a deal. But White House officials were still reviewing the proposal, and President Trump, who has resisted sending more money to Puerto Rico, had yet to endorse it. ... Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said of the new proposal: 'I'm hopeful. It deals with additional resources to Puerto Rico, it deals with making sure the money doesn't get wasted.'\"\n\nOne of Barr's predecessors accused him of trying to protect Trump:\n\nThe Senate's Democratic whip raised this concern about the attorney general:\n\nAnother Democratic senator added this Nixon comparison:\n\nFrom a Mueller biographer:\n\nA Cond\u00e9 Nast editor tweeted a photo of Mueller's military days:\n\nA New York Times columnist scrutinized this answer from Barr:\n\nFrom a University of Alabama law professor and a former U.S. attorney:\n\nFrom a CNN reporter:\n\nHillary's former spokesman, who is now at the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, mocked the questions posed to Barr by GOP senators:\n\nA political science professor at the University of Denver pushed back against Trump's claims of presidential harassment:\n\nFox News host Chris Wallace said Mueller's letter shouldn't be underestimated:\n\nA Fox colleague fired back:\n\nThe schedule for an iconic Iowa caucus event is set:\n\nA Republican congressman running for Alabama's Senate seat criticized Biden for his comments on China:\n\nMitt Romney, who was mercilessly mocked in 2012 by Biden for saying Russia was the biggest geopolitical threat facing the U.S., piled on:\n\nA BuzzFeed News reporter tweeted a photo of this bizarre Biden sign in Iowa:\n\nHillary Clinton ran into a fan:\n\nAnd Elizabeth Warren celebrated her golden retriever's birthday:\n\nGOOD READS FROM ELSEWHERE:\n\n-- BuzzFeed News, \"A Former Alt-Right Member's Message: Get Out While You Still Can,\" by Rosie Gray: \"If you remember Katie McHugh, it's probably because of the tweets. ... There are many ... examples, but this is the big one, the one that ultimately triggered her firing from her job as a writer and editor at Breitbart News in 2017: 'There would be no deadly terror attacks in the U.K. if Muslims didn't live there.' If you look at her Twitter feed now, you'll see that it's changed. It's locked, and her bio is blank. Where is McHugh? I can't tell you, but I've seen her lately. The first time we met was late last summer, on the stoop of a house where she was then living in Washington, DC. She looked gaunt and anxious. When I shook her hand it felt tiny and frail. We sat facing each other across a patio table on a hot, sticky day. ... She was saying she wanted to leave it all behind: her years as a far-right media figure and tweeter, and someone whom close observers of right-wing media knew was one of Breitbart's most obvious connections to the white supremacist core of the alt-right.\"\n\n-- The New Yorker, \"How the Census Changed America,\" by Ted Widmer: \"The 1890 Census was simply too big to bind; it was five times larger than all the previous censuses combined. ... The chief clerk of the census predicted that it would require a seven-thousand-foot shelf to store them all. Finding more than a mile of empty shelf space was difficult, even in a city that was already known for its bureaucracy. So the pile sat around, sparking no joy among the officials charged with its safekeeping. ... The papers were arranged on narrow pine shelves, in cardboard packages wrapped with twine. ... The space was also very hot -- more than ninety degrees when the boiler was running. On the afternoon of January 10, 1921, an employee noticed smoke coming through openings around the pipes that ran from the boiler room into the file room. ... The greatest effort in history to tell a nation's story had gone up in a puff of smoke. ... The idea of a National Archives ... emerged in response to the disaster.\"\n\n-- Bloomberg Businessweek, \"The Most Valuable Company (for Now) Is Having a Nadellaissance,\" by Austin Carr and Dina Bass: \"Even if it doesn't last, [Satya] Nadella's turnaround over the five years since he replaced Steve Ballmer as CEO [of Microsoft] has been nothing short of historic. The company had been universally viewed as spiraling toward obsolescence, having missed almost every significant computing trend of the 2000s -- mobile phones, search engines, social networking -- while letting its main source of revenue, Windows, the operating system that comes preloaded on PCs, stagnate. Microsoft marketers like to attribute its reemergence as a tech power to a sort of cultural rehab, involving what Nadella calls corporate 'empathy' and a shift of his team from a 'fixed mindset' to a 'growth mindset.' The reality of the company's turnaround was more painful, according to interviews with more than four dozen current and former executives, board members, customers, and competitors.\"\n\nTrump and the first lady will participate in a National Day of Prayer service and later meet with Republican senators.\n\n-- It'll be a partly sunny day with chances of an afternoon storm.

Jessica Contrera reports: \"Kieran was visiting one of those hotels with his mother and grandmother. He had just sat down for breakfast when a suicide bomber entered the buffet line nearby. Kieran's mother and grandmother survived the attack, but he was hit with three pieces of shrapnel. One pierced his heart.

Europe's General Data Protection Regulation went into effect almost a year ago, and the outcomes of these investigations will reveal whether the new rules have teeth.\n\n\"We have reason to believe then clearly that there are potential infringements of the GDPR arising,\" Dixon said at the hearing. \"We are significantly advanced in a number of those investigations and intend to bring a decision and an outcome on those investigations.\"\n\nThe sheer number of probes highlights how the European regulators are increasingly emerging as the de facto top cop of American tech companies -- when there are still divisions in Congress over what a federal privacy law should encompass in the U.S.\n\nIreland's commission hasn't yet brought any fines against U.S. tech firms under the new European regulatory regime -- but any penalties it pursues could be as much as 4 percent of a company's annual worldwide revenue.\n\nIreland is charged with overseeing the enforcement of GDPR when it comes to most technology companies because many have their European headquarters in the country. Dixon testified that Internet platforms are among the top sources of complaints to the commission. Other sectors that receive the most complaints include banking and telecommunications.\n\nAs the one-year mark of GDPR looms, the country's role in enforcing the law has come under scrutiny as critics wonder why the commission has not yet brought fines against any companies. Dixon told yesterday's panel it's taking time because the \"sanctions are significant\" and the commission needs to give companies the opportunity to respond at various steps in the process.\n\nStill, their relative organization is striking since there has been little motion in Washington toward achieving a privacy bill. Lawmakers remain divided over issues including whether individuals should be able to sue companies over perceived privacy violations and how much authority to grant to the Federal Trade Commission to to penalize companies that violate consumers' privacy.\n\nAnd Democrats want to ensure that a federal bill would not water down or pre-empt strong state privacy laws, such as the one in California slated to take effect next year. During yesterday's panel, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said every American's privacy rights should be just as strong as residents of California. The consumer advocates on the panel agreed that law should be viewed as a floor -- not a ceiling -- for any legislation Congress considers.\n\nStill, many in Big Tech say they are on board with some kind of rules -- signaling the pressure the companies are under to show they're taking consumer privacy seriously. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, have been calling on the United States to adopt federal privacy legislation similar to the GDPR. The technology industry is warming up to the European regime and even prefers it to a federal law that takes after California's privacy bill, or an outcome where it would need to navigate a patchwork of state rules.\n\nRepublicans have also raised concerns that a patchwork of different state privacy laws could be a compliance nightmare for the companies and hinder innovation.\n\nAnd the U.S. will also face a test for the enforcement of its own existing rules soon. Federal Trade Commission is in negotiations with Facebook over a multi-billion dollar fine that would settle the agency's probe into Facebook's privacy practices. After Wall Street shrugged off Facebook's announcement it was setting aside billions for such a fine last week, many critics said it's time for the U.S. to get tougher and consider stronger remedies when tech giants violate consumers' privacy.\n\nBITS: The rise of foreign money rushing into venture capital funds and startups has transformed Silicon Valley into a \"geopolitical minefield,\" Recode's Theodore Schleifer reports. Start-ups and venture capitalists are making judgement calls or reacting to crosscurrents that the tech industry didn't have to worry about decades ago.\n\n\"It's the world of geopolitics coming to venture,\" Robert Ackerman, a venture capitalist active in cybersecurity, told Theodore. \"It's got a lot more gray than black and white -- and we're all trying to figure that out.\"\n\nAs China and Saudi Arabia cash bolsters a recent gold rush in Silicon Valley, companies are grappling with how to respond to the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi or whether Chinese telecommunications company Huawei poses a national security threat.\n\n\"But for too long, most people in Silicon Valley have treated foreign cash with a collective shrug, seeing money as money and not truly considering the ethical and regulatory challenges of taking investment from certain foreign countries, Recode interviews with more than 50 venture capitalists, startups, lawyers, and others involved in cross-border investing reveal,\" Theodore writes. \"Now Silicon Valley is scrambling to assess its own exposure in this new world order.\"\n\nNIBBLES: As it negotiates a settlement with Facebook to conclude its privacy probe, the FTC may require the social network to place \"privacy-minded\" executives at the company's highest levels, Politico's Nancy Scola reports. The steps would be in addition to a multi-billion dollar fine.\n\nThe steps could include appointing a federally-approved privacy official and creating an independent privacy oversight board. Also, Mark Zuckerberg could be required to take on the role of \"designated compliance officer,\" which would make him personally accountable for the steps the company takes on privacy.\n\nAs Politico notes, the negotiations are ongoing, and the deal terms are subject to change.\n\n\"While talk of a multibillion-dollar fine against Facebook has grabbed headlines, the question of structural changes looms as a much more meaningful issue for the company, which has amassed a market value of more than $500 billion through its command of detailed data on 2.4 billion users worldwide,\" Nancy wrote. \"Wall Street has reacted with a collective shrug to reports of the fine given Facebook's financial resources, but mandated changes to the company's business model could have a longer-term impact.\"\n\nBut privacy advocates warned that changes to Facebook's governance structure may not go far enough.\n\n\"The additional remedies are not meaningful,\" Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told Politico. \"Creating an independent office, or an office within Facebook -- which by the way, is not independent -- does not establish new privacy obligations, nor does it ensure compliance.\"\n\nBYTES: Google announced yesterday it would begin allowing users to set a time limit for how long it stores their web brosing history or location data, CNBC's Todd Haselton reports.\n\nCurrently users need to manually opt-out of such storage by visiting Google and deciding to delete it or turn it off completely.

For a top government minister to be canned over such a leak is almost unprecedented in Britain.\n\nWilliamson denied any involvement in the unauthorized disclosure.\n\nThe British political press quickly focused on the \"Game of Thrones\" atmosphere in May's fractious government, stoked by open divisions over Brexit and by May's weak leadership.\n\nWilliamson is one of the many aspirants to replace May, who is seen as especially vulnerable over her failure to deliver a European Union exit plan. Whether she resigns in the coming months, as she has indicated she might do, or is ousted more quickly, is a point of debate.\n\nAfter an April 23 meeting of Britain's National Security Council, attended by intelligence chiefs and senior cabinet ministers, a story appeared on the front page of the Daily Telegraph that claimed May had decided to permit Huawei to play a leading role in building Britain's 5G Internet -- despite intense pressure from the United States to ban Huawei as a security risk.\n\nIn this April 8 photo, Gavin Williamson walks with Penny Mordaunt, who would replace him as defense secretary.

But revelations about U.S. tech companies and their abilities to harvest user data have increased suspicions about what the Chinese could do if they were operating the switches.\n\nIn a letter to Williamson on Wednesday, May wrote that an investigation into the leaks provided \"compelling evidence suggesting your responsibility for the unauthorized disclosure.\"\n\n\"No other, credible version of events to explain this leak has been identified,\" May added.\n\nIn his reply, Williamson wrote: \"I strenuously deny that I was in any way involved in this leak and I am confident that a thorough and formal inquiry would have vindicated my position.\"\n\nWilliamson became defense secretary in late 2017, after Michael Fallon left the role following allegations of inappropriate behavior toward women.\n\nIn his previous role as chief whip, Williamson kept a tarantula on his desk called Cronus.\n\nWilliamson was replaced on Wednesday evening by Penny Mordaunt.

(Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images) By Henry Farrell and Henry Farrell Abraham Newman May 1 at 3:15 PM\n\nGavin Williamson was just fired as Britain's defense secretary after being accused of leaking information.\n\nLast week, Britain's National Security Council decided that Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies would be allowed to play a limited role in building Britain's 5G telecommunications network. Someone leaked this information to a British newspaper. According to the BBC, British Prime Minister Theresa May told Williamson that she had \"compelling evidence\" that he was responsible for the leak. Williamson has denied that he was the leaker.\n\nThis crisis in British politics reflects a broader set of global security problems: Telecommunications networks, which sound boring and technical, have become a major security issue.\n\nThere is a big fight happening over Huawei.\n\nThe leak was highly embarrassing to the British government because it revealed how controversial the Huawei decision was within the government. Britain -- like other European jurisdictions -- will have to upgrade its wireless communication network to 5G speeds. Huawei has played a substantial role in building the existing network, and it is widely regarded as the market leader. However, the United States wants to limit the reach of Huawei and has been engaged in a concerted diplomatic campaign to get its allies to boot Huawei out of their national telecommunications markets. This means that U.S. allies face a difficult choice: going with Huawei and incurring the displeasure of Washington or going with other providers and possibly paying much more, as well as encountering serious technical difficulties.\n\nBritain decided informally to go ahead with Huawei, despite its strong security relationship with the United States. This decision was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, which also revealed that key cabinet members opposed the decision. The fallout from that leak is what prompted today's firing.\n\nSurveillance politics are challenging political alliances.\n\nThe reason the United States does not want Huawei to play a role in telecommunications networks is straightforward. It fears that Huawei is too closely connected to China's government and will build back doors into these networks to allow China to easily spy on the West. Washington has taken steps to force Huawei out of the U.S. market and has made strong public statements about a need to exclude it more generally.\n\nThe problem is that U.S. allies are less likely to go along with U.S. wishes than they used to be.\n\nThat is, in part, because of the United States itself: The U.S. National Security Agency has remorselessly exploited global communications networks to spy in pursuit of the U.S. national interest. While it has shared key surveillance information with U.S. allies, it has also spied on many of them. This means that some allies are less willing to listen to U.S. warnings about Chinese spying than they might otherwise be, reasoning that the United States is itself in a somewhat hypocritical position.\n\nIt is also in part because the United States and its allies have different security sensitivities and different perceptions over whether they can stop bad behavior by Huawei or other companies.\n\nAnd in part, it is because of money: Excluding Huawei might make it far more expensive to build 5G networks.\n\nGlobal networks are being weaponized.\n\nThis is just one example of a broader problem that we describe in our forthcoming article for International Security on \"weaponized interdependence.\"\n\nOver the past 25 years, the world economy has become increasingly dependent on global networks -- not only in telecommunications, but also in finance, the Internet and the supply chains that build physical products. These networks produce enormous economic efficiencies, but they can also lead to serious security vulnerabilities. Now states are beginning to insulate themselves from these insecurities in ways that have international repercussions.\n\nThis will have big consequences for the global economy, as networks shrink and governments become far more suspicious of interdependent relationships between economies. It will also lead to quarrels between allies, which have different and sometimes conflicting understandings of security threats but also find that their fates are bound together. So one country's insecurities potentially threaten the security of its partners, or one country's efforts to insulate itself have huge economic ramifications for other countries that depend on it.\n\nFinally, it is having important domestic consequences, as political decision-makers within countries begin to fight about the appropriate way to respond to challenges of economic cost and security vulnerability. Williamson's firing is just one early indication of a much broader set of problems that is likely to reshape global economic politics.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RJyuolwqbSvjEChc6R-NiW3sW6o=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PGTHTMDMGYI6TO7HDR4Y7OAFGY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4755731", "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 294437880}, {"uri": "1125435568", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-01", "time": "07:13:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-01T07:13:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/technology/huawei-china-communist-party.html", "title": "'Striding Across the Pacific': Huawei's Identity Problem", "body": "The Chinese telecom giant seeks acceptance in the West, but its structure and value system -- patterned after the Communist Party's -- could stand in the way.\n\nThe Huawei Technologies founder Ren Zhengfei once recommended that his senior executives watch a TV series called \"Proof of Identity.\" In that 2009 series, a Communist spy who had infiltrated the Nationalist army during China's civil war struggles for years to prove his loyalty and identity after the Communists prevail.\n\nToday, 32 years after he founded the telecom giant with $3,000 of borrowed money, Mr. Ren is struggling to prove that Huawei is a private enterprise and independent of the Chinese government.\n\nThe task is more urgent than ever. In recent months, the Trump administration has said China could use Huawei's equipment to spy on other countries, though it hasn't offered proof. Critics accuse the company of being controlled by the Chinese government. Huawei has repeatedly denied these allegations, saying it is owned by its employees and wouldn't spy on its customers.\n\nRegardless of the issues of ownership and control, which have been subjects of heated debate, Huawei's struggle stems in part from its own internal conflict. The company has been deeply influenced by Western competitors. Huawei wants to help determine the world's technological future, and Mr. Ren himself has said the company may need to adapt to get there.\n\nBut at its core, from its organizational structure to the way it builds employee loyalty, Huawei closely resembles the Chinese Communist Party itself.\n\nMr. Ren's management thinking \"will naturally carry very deep imprints of the Communist Party culture,\" according to a 2017 book, \"Will Huawei Be the Next to Fall?\" (A different version was published in English as \"The Huawei Story.\")\n\nThough effusive in tone, the book -- named after the sort of question Mr. Ren often poses to employees to inspire urgency -- offers hints of why Huawei has struggled to reconcile its global ambitions with its Chinese values. The book benefits from access, including interviews with more than 100 top executives. The lead writer, Tian Tao, a management professor, has been a friend of Mr. Ren's for two decades, and Huawei sometimes gives out copies as gifts.\n\nHuawei disputed that its internal identity contributed to its problems. Citing strong financial results, it said in a statement that \"over all, Huawei's identity is accepted by customers across most of the world.\"\n\n\"All we can do to address the issues of identity is to remain open and transparent, and we intend to do that,\" it added.\n\nHuawei isn't the first Chinese institution to grapple with how to relate with the rest of the world.\n\nSince the late 1800s, China has debated how much it should learn from the West while retaining what many people see as core Chinese values: patriotism, loyalty, collective values over individual rights. The idea is known as \"Chinese substance, Western application,\" and it calls for seeking the tools for China's economic and military revival without embracing ideas like individual rights, rule of law and transparency.\n\nThat model served China well for decades. But it falters when institutions like Huawei start reaching out to the rest of the world. Many in the West worry that Huawei doesn't share their values and that it could become an actor for an authoritarian state. It will take more than a few rounds of media interviews to overcome that mistrust.\n\nMr. Ren understands the differences between the two systems. In a September speech, he instructed the company's public relations department to highlight the Huawei values that align with the West to help reach consensus.\n\n\"We have our own value system. We don't accept the Western political value system completely,\" Mr. Ren said.\n\nStill, he added: \"Their civilization was built in thousands of years. A small company like Huawei won't be able to change it.\"\n\nJudging from the book, his speeches and other appearances, Mr. Ren is a student of Western learning. He has said he admires the American political and legal systems because they offer better protection for businesses -- not an unusual idea among China's business class. He paid I.B.M. consultants for nearly two decades to help Huawei institute American-style corporate management. To catch up with the Western competitors, he once said, Huawei needed to \"wear American shoes\" even if it meant hurting its feet.\n\n\"Only by learning from them with all our humility can we defeat them one day,\" Mr. Ren was quoted as saying in the book.\n\nStill, while Huawei is eager to learn from the West, its soul is steeped in Communist Party culture.\n\n\"In a country with little business management philosophy and experience, China's entrepreneurs had to resort to the traditional political and party culture for guidance,\" according to the book.\n\nHuawei's structure looks strikingly similar to the party's. Each is run by a senior group of seven officials, with similarities even further down the line. It calls its management training program its Central Party School, which is the name of the Communist Party institution that trains promising cadres.\n\nWhen it comes to team-building and loyalty-building, Mr. Ren turned to the party's system of self-criticism, in which cadres confess to their misdeeds. Self-criticism sessions are called \"democratic life meetings,\" just like the party's.\n\n\"This is the Chinese heritage,\" the book's authors wrote. \"Western companies will never understand it. Even if they understand, they won't be able to practice it.\"\n\nHuawei also routinely holds ceremonies for its executives, from the board down, to pledge integrity and honesty, much as the party does. Mr. Ren, a former military engineer, also infuses Huawei with a militant culture. He sometimes refers to major business deals as a \"Battle for Triangle Hill,\" a reference to a clash during the Korean War that included Chinese and American troops.\n\nThe ultimate Battle for Triangle Hill, he has said, is to surpass American rivals. His 2012 annual letter ends with the sentence, \"With lofty aspirations and esprit de corps, we are striding across the Pacific Ocean,\" referring to the lyrics of a famous song about the Chinese Army crossing the Yalu River to fight the Americans and South Koreans.\n\nHe told CNBC that he liked using military terms because they were easy to understand. \"When I can't find a better term to easily describe how business works, I use military terms,\" he said.\n\nHuawei's hard-charging corporate spirit -- known as \"wolf culture\" to outsiders and employees and as \"striving culture\" to executives -- can trace its roots to the party. When Huawei came under attack a decade ago after some employee suicides made headlines in China, Mr. Ren remarked, according to the book: \"What's wrong with striving? We learned this from the Communist Party. We'll strive for the realization of communism until the end of our lives.\"\n\nEven Mr. Ren's leadership status looks like that of Deng Xiaoping, China's former paramount leader, who started China's reform and opening period in the late 1970s. Deng gave up his titles in his later years -- though he remained chairman of the China Bridge Association -- but he held the ultimate authority in China's decision making until his death in 1997.\n\nThough Mr. Ren is Huawei's chief executive, he has said he holds no decision-making power except for vetoing proposals and removing executives from their posts. Huawei's board secretary, Jiang Xisheng, told journalists last week that Mr. Ren had limited veto power.\n\nBut within Huawei, he is clearly the paramount leader.\n\n\"One can't use one's veto and impeachment power too often. Once or twice a year would suffice,\" he was quoted as saying in the book. \"Nuclear deterrence only works when the bomb remains unexploded.\"\n\nHuawei's pledge to remain open isn't likely to be enough to win over those put off by its culture. To win trust in the West, Huawei may have to change its DNA.\n\nThe same goes with China.

Despite months of pressure from the White House, Chinese negotiators have so far refused to relax tight regulations that block multinational companies from moving data they gather on their Chinese customers' purchases, habits and whereabouts out of the country. Such data is crucial as industries build next-generation technologies.\n\nWith another round of trade talks underway this week, the United States and China appear headed toward an agreement that could end the monthslong trade war and lift tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of products. China is offering to strengthen its laws surrounding intellectual property, direct large purchases of American goods and reduce barriers for foreign companies in industries like finance and agriculture. It has also proposed giving foreign cloud computing companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Apple greater ability to operate independently in China, people familiar with the negotiations say.\n\nA trade deal between the two nations will calm tensions and be seen as a victory for Mr. Trump, but some American technology companies fear the administration is giving up a valuable opportunity to press China on data-related issues and will cede too much economic power to Beijing.\n\nChina has already overseen a splintering of the world's internet, a move that has helped Chinese companies catch up to American firms. Over the past two decades, China built and shored up the Great Firewall, which blocks websites including YouTube, Facebook, Google and The New York Times from reaching more than 700 million Chinese internet users. Behind those barriers, Chinese internet companies like Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent have thrived, developing cutting-edge services that have in many respects surpassed those of their Western competitors.\n\nThe American tech industry is concerned that this same fracturing is being repeated with data, setting up more permanent divisions in how technology will be used around the world. As companies collect and analyze ever more data on customers, China has insisted that information be stored within its borders, on Chinese-made servers and routers, and not be transferred out of the country.\n\nBusiness executives say relaxing China's restrictions on data is critical to ability of the United States to build globally competitive firms in areas like autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence, which are expected to power jobs and economic growth.\n\nChina describes its data restrictions as an issue of national security, but technology firms, financial advisers, energy companies and others argue that the rules are intended to help Beijing dominate data-intensive industries. American firms say the restrictions increase their costs, force them to share sensitive technology with Chinese partners, make them more susceptible to cybertheft and leave them beholden to Chinese monitoring and censorship.\n\nTrade in data is just one of several technology issues the United States is discussing with China. Trump officials are also trying to end Beijing's pattern of forcing American companies that operate in the country to transfer valuable technology to Chinese partners, and curb cybertheft. It remains unclear how these issues will be resolved, but a final deal is expected to include changes that allow American companies in the financial and automotive industries to operate independently, rather than with a Chinese partner.\n\n\"There's no question to me that the Chinese are setting up a separate technology system, and they are a superpower in the field,\" said Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, a consulting group. \"There are some areas where they are more advanced than we are.\"\n\nThe enormous volume of email, software, audio and video content that crosses international borders each day facilitates trade in goods and services in a range of industries, including entertainment, finance, law, manufacturing and retail.\n\nIt is also allowing companies to amass troves of information on customer behavior, through monitoring purchases on Amazon, Netflix binges, GPS routing, fitness tracking and other digital services. That data, in turn, gives companies information about users' shopping habits, viewing history, driving patterns and health that is feeding the development of industries like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning and autonomous vehicles.\n\nCompanies are also gathering data about their own operations from sensors that monitor production lines in factories and alert retailers when certain products are out of stock.\n\nThis data is helping companies make and sell products in ways that are far more important to the American economy than is typically recognized, said Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center. A 2016 study by the McKinsey Global Institute found that digital flows now exert a larger impact on economic growth than trade in goods.\n\nDespite its economic importance, there are few global rules governing trade in data. Trade in goods is governed by the World Trade Organization and an extensive network of bilateral and multilateral trade deals, but no similar regulatory structure exists for data flows.\n\nThat is beginning to change. The United States has enshrined the tech industry's position in the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, which provides for open access to government data, protections for company source codes and algorithms and a prohibition on customs duties on data, among other provisions.\n\nThe agreement will serve as a jumping-off point for American trade talks with Japan, as well as negotiations on e-commerce rules with more than 70 countries at the W.T.O. Trade agreements between Europe and Japan, and between Japan and a collection of 10 other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, also have as a default the free flow of information, with some exceptions.\n\nIn other parts of the world, the tide is moving in the opposite direction, said Aaron Cooper, vice president of global policy at the Software Alliance, a trade group. In countries like India, Indonesia, Russia and Vietnam, governments are introducing regulations to ostensibly protect their citizens' privacy and build domestic internet industries that will stymie the ability of American companies to provide services in those countries.\n\nChina and the United States, home to the world's largest tech companies, are the global \"controllers of data,\" said Susan Aaronson, a professor of international affairs at George Washington University. \"There are private firms in the United States, and private firms in China that work very closely with the Chinese government.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen which country takes the lead and how rules around their data evolve. For now, both are throwing up roadblocks to thwart one another. For instance, Chinese rules prevent foreign companies from mapping the country, which could limit the ability of American companies to offer automated driving technology. American lawmakers and policymakers have tried to prevent China from monopolizing data-related infrastructure by barring Huawei and other Chinese telecom equipment firms from building any part of America's next-generation telecom network.\n\nIn the trade talks, China has offered some concessions on rules governing the cloud computing industry, where foreign companies are required to operate in tandem with a Chinese partner. In a meeting in March, China's premier, Li Keqiang, floated the idea of giving foreign cloud computing companies the ability to operate independently in a free-trade zone, as well as two of the roughly eight licenses that companies need to operate in China, people familiar with the negotiations say. In return, the Trump administration has pressed China to provide all the required licenses, and eliminate all ownership requirements without geographic restrictions.\n\nThe Chinese have also been willing to discuss setting a fairly high bar for which companies are deemed so vital to China's information infrastructure that they have to keep vast amounts of data within China using government-approved telecommunications equipment. The Chinese government has discussed applying its most stringent rules to enterprises with a market share of at least 10 percent, said one person familiar with the discussions.\n\nAmerican negotiators have called on China for more openness on its data rules, but it is not one of the Trump administration's top priorities, and China has given little ground, people familiar with the negotiations say. Even if China opens up to foreign cloud computing, continued restrictions on the flow of data from China will make these ventures less profitable. And companies say that Chinese laws on critical data could be used to curtail their operations at any time.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/01/business/01-DIGITALTRADE-PRINT/00dc-digitaltrade-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 294359040}, {"uri": "1124792359", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-30", "time": "12:08:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-30T12:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2019/04/30/the-cybersecurity-202-here-are-the-55-things-the-u-s-government-most-needs-to-protect-against-cyberattacks/5cc7a3b01ad2e52459e246fe/", "title": "Analysis | The Cybersecurity 202: Here are the 55 things the U.S. government most needs to protect against cyberattacks", "body": "Christopher Krebs, director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is releasing today a list of 55 things the government most needs to protect from digital attacks.\n\nThe government believes that a cyberattack on any of these government or private sector services or functions could have a \"debilitating effect\" on national security, the U.S. economy or public health.\n\nOn the list, provided first to The Cybersecurity 202, are some obvious things -- such as supplying water or generating electricity. But the list also delves into some broader categories, including preserving Constitutional rights, protecting sensitive information, and enforcing the law. The list includes everything from providing internet access to supporting community health and conducting elections. You can read the full list here.\n\nThe U.S. has long relied on a system that prioritized protecting industry sectors -- such as transportation, financial services and energy -- as part of its critical infrastructure. But these broad categories are proving far too imprecise in an age when, say, North Korea launched a destructive attack on a film studio and Russia orchestrated a sweeping election inferference campaign.\n\nThe plan is part of a broader DHS effort to shift to a \"risk-based\" approach to cybersecurity -- in other words, devoting more time and money to threats that could do the most damage.\n\n\"If everything's a priority, then nothing's a priority,\" Director of DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Chris Krebs told me. \"This allows us to really drill down into those things we need to care about.\"\n\nA main benefit of the new system is that it will allow government and industry to map out how a single digital threat -- say an attack on the Global Positioning System or Internet routing services -- might ricochet across numerous industries, Krebs said.\n\nDHS's previous system for categorizing digital threats focused on 16 critical infrastructure sectors but didn't deal with the complex web of interdependence between them. And it didn't distinguish between truly vital systems, like those that deliver electricity, versus less vital ones, such as that electric utility's public-facing website.\n\n\"[Now] we can focus on ... the gaps and overlays between [industry] sectors,\" Krebs said. \"We want to back out from these artificial economic sectors into something more focused on what [industries] actually deliver at the end of the day.\"\n\nInstead of listing the healthcare sector, for example, the new critical functions list includes systems that \"maintain access to medical records\" and that \"support community health.\" And instead of transportation, it lists transporting cargo and passengers by air, rail, road, mass transit and vessels -- and materials by pipeline.\n\nThe department also plans to work with industry to identify which functions are the most critical of the critical. The department will use that prioritized list -- which it may or may not make public -- to frame conversations with industry about cybersecurity tactics and to guide DHS's budget requests to Congress, Krebs said.\n\n\"Not all [55] functions are created equal in terms of priority, so you can start triaging, putting the most critical ones at the top, figuring out where do we want to put our scarce resources,\" he said.\n\nPINGED: President Trump's lack of interest in election security and his unwillingness to condemn Russian hackers \"has made it tougher for government officials to implement a more comprehensive approach to preserving the integrity of the electoral process,\" my colleagues Josh Dawsey, Ellen Nakashima and Shane Harris report.\n\n\"For more than two years...Trump has recoiled when aides broached Russia's 2016 theft and dissemination of Democratic emails and its ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion of social media in an effort to sway the election,\" my colleagues report.\n\nDuring one 2017 meeting with advisers, Trump called the hacking operation - which the intelligence community attributed to Russia - \"a goddamn hoax,\" my colleagues reported.\n\nThe president also regularly conflates discussions about Russia's interference in the election with attacks on the legitimacy of his election, current and former officials said.\n\n\"In one meeting in late summer 2018 in the Situation Room, aides told Trump that they wanted to talk publicly to raise voters' awareness of the interference ahead of the midterm,\" my colleagues reported. \"According to an official familiar with the meeting, Trump placed a condition on any public statements: The aides must also make clear that Russia didn't influence his win.\"\n\nPATCHED: Washington doesn't believe there's any safe way to allow Huawei inside next-generation 5G wireless networks without enabling Chinese spying, the State Department's top cybersecurity diplomat Robert Strayer told reporters in Brussels on Monday, the Wall Street Journal's Parmy Olson reported.\n\nThe statement comes less than a week after the United Kingdom decided to let Huawei construct noncore portions of its 5G networks.\n\nStrayer didn't directly address the U.K. decision, the Journal reported. \"But asked about whether the U.S. and the U.K. were aligned on what constitutes vulnerable parts of a network, he said: 'no part of a 5G network should have parts or software coming from a vendor that could be under the control of an authoritarian government,'\" the Journal reported.\n\nThe United States has lobbied numerous allies to ban Huawei from their 5G networks but with limited success. Only Australia has fully barred the Chinese telecom so far. The Trump administration has also not yet released its own order barring Huawei from U.S. 5G networks.\n\nPWNED: A jailed former CIA computer engineer who's accused of leaking a massive trove of hacking tools made a series of claims in a legal filing asking to be released from federal detention that many on Twitter noted were outlandish.\n\nJoshua Schulte, who's accused of passing the documents known as Vault 7 to WikiLeaks, claimed he's lost $50 billion during his incarceration, according to independent journalist Marcy Wheeler.\n\nSchulte also \"lost time mentoring and teaching my youngest brother programming as he attends college and most likely learns the wrong way to align braces and indent,\" according to the filing quoted by Cyberscoop's Jeff Stone.\n\nHe's \"also a huge movie buff and I've already missed major blockbuster releases that I would have reserved in advance at Alamo Drafthouse and enjoyed with family and friends,\" the filing states.\n\nSchulte was first charged with storing child pornography in 2017.

(Andy Wong/AP) By Michael Auslin April 29 at 10:55 AM\n\nMichael Auslin is a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and the author of \"The End of the Asian Century.\"\n\nThe 40th anniversary of the normalization of Sino-U.S. relations, which took place on the first day of this year, passed almost unnoticed. Instead of a joint commemoration or high-profile speeches, Washington and Beijing instead traded thinly disguised threats: President Trump signed legislation designed to counter China's growing power in the Indo-Pacific, while Chinese leader Xi Jinping again urged his military to be prepared to wage war. Going from purported partnership to fears of a new Cold War, China and the United States have entered a new era. And even if they manage to come to some sort of agreement to end their long-simmering differences on trade in the next few weeks -- as the Trump administration has been indicating -- that still won't neutralize the larger forces at work.\n\nIt is surprising how quickly attitudes have soured on both sides of the Pacific. Just a few years ago, there was talk of a new Sino-U.S. \"G-2\" that would adjudicate global problems -- a notion that already seems to belong to a long-distant past. Now competition is seen as the new normal. While Beijing feels that Washington is trying to contain China, Americans finally reacted to long-standing feelings that China was taking advantage of American openness and becoming actively hostile to U.S. interests. The final years of the Obama administration saw a sharp deterioration in U.S.-China ties, as Beijing built and militarized islands in the South China Sea and blockbuster reports on the scale of Chinese cyber espionage made headlines.\n\nPresident Trump has made good on his campaign promises to hit back at Chinese unfair practices and aggressive acts. From levying $250 billion worth of tariffs to force the Chinese to the negotiating table, to calling out great-power competition (read: China) in his first National Security Strategy, Trump has upended trans-Pacific ties. His administration is sending more ships through Chinese-claimed waters in Asia, blocking Huawei from U.S. 5G networks, and arresting those stealing trade secrets. Both the administration and Congress have raised the alarm about China's influence operations in the United States and its growing high-tech surveillance state.\n\nWhile trade (estimated at $737 billion) and exchange have produced a complex web of ties between China and the United States, politically the two are steadily pulling apart. The 40th anniversary of normalization marked a crucial boundary, cementing a dynamic of suspicion and increased competition. Beijing continues to push its One Belt One Road Initiative, while ratcheting up both rhetoric and pressure against Taiwan and Hong Kong and imprisoning a million Uighurs in \"reeducation camps.\" Even though increases in military spending have slowed in the past several years (thanks to a slowing economy), Beijing is using much of that estimated $175 billion on advanced weapons such as aircraft carriers, hypersonic missiles and stealth fighters, while billions more are spent on programs not included in the defense budget, such as the space program and paramilitary forces.\n\nThis hasn't gone unnoticed in Washington. The new Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, authored by Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and signed by President Trump at the end of last year, provides $1.5 billion annually through 2023 to build up U.S. alliances and partnerships throughout the Indo-Pacific, on top of existing funding for U.S. forces deployed throughout the region.\n\nThose predicting war between China and the United States are likely to be disappointed, just as were their predecessors who foresaw conflict between Japan and the United States in the 1990s. Yet neither does the future offer grounds for a continuation of business as usual. In reality, China is weakening. Its economy is slowing, its technology is coming under suspicion, and its offers of foreign aid awaken suspicions among potential recipients. Meanwhile, Chinese citizens continue to offshore as much of their money as they can, while criticism of Xi slowly gathers beneath the surface of his cult of personality. While the trade war is hurting small American manufacturers and some big ones such as Apple, China is feeling far more squeezed, with growth dropping to 30-year lows as weaknesses in China's economy are exacerbated by the tariff battle.\n\nChina's mounting problems do not mean that it will suddenly reform or turn away from competition with the United States. In the short term, it may indeed become more dangerous, as Xi attempts to deflect growing dissatisfaction at home with adventurism abroad. Yet it is China that has abused the openness of the global system through its mercantilist policies, rampant stealing of intellectual property, and the use of \"debt trap diplomacy\" on smaller nations. By not attempting earlier to curb China's actions, successive U.S. administrations made the inevitable reckoning that much more painful.\n\nBeijing's hand is weaker, however, and the Trump administration can offer some easing of pressure as long as the real problems we have with China are addressed. The Chinese need to realize that is in their best interests to adopt more cooperative policies to reduce tension with Washington. Whatever else happens, the next phase of the relationship will be starkly different from the previous 40 years.

He took a break from the mining ore business to travel to a VR theme park in this Chinese provincial capital not known for high technology.\n\n\"It feels like reality,\" Liu said after shooting down robots in a virtual fighter jet, strapped to a spinning gyroscope lit in purple. \"It's just like you're riding in a plane.\"\n\nEnthusiasm for VR has cooled somewhat after years of hype, but China's leaders are trying to drum up excitement, hoping to take the lead in a technology they expect will eventually gain wide use.\n\nHoping to coax homegrown entrepreneurs to take the plunge, the government is educating students, subsidizing office spaces, and sponsoring conferences and competitions.\n\nNanchang's VR Star park offers 42 rides and exhibits, including VR bumper cars and VR shoot-'em-ups. It's the highlight of Nanchang's \"VR base,\" a sprawling complex of mostly still empty, futuristic glass-and-steel offices.\n\nThe city of 5.5 million is the capital of Jiangxi province, a relatively impoverished region nestled in the mountains of south-central China, where the regional industries are copper mining and rice.\n\nOfficials hope that one day it will be a world-class hub for virtual reality.\n\n\"Frankly, VR isn't 100% necessary in the Chinese market at the moment,\" said Xiong Zongming, CEO of IN-UP Technology, one of dozens of firms being incubated by the VR base. \"But with the government's push, many other companies, departments and agencies are more willing to try it out.\"\n\nXiong was born in Nanchang but studied and worked in Japan for nearly a decade before returning to China, where he settled in Shanghai. Nanchang officials enticed him back home with offers of free rent and 150,000 RMB ($22,340) in startup funds, part of an effort to lure back local talent from richer coastal cities to help lift the local economy.\n\nBeijing began its VR drive a few years ago, when slick headsets from Samsung, Oculus, HTC and Sony were making a big splash at electronics shows in the U.S.\n\nChinese leaders were worried they might miss out on a boom.\n\nVR is included in Beijing's \"Made in China 2025\", an ambitious plan to develop global competitors in cutting edge technologies including electric cars, solar and wind power, and robotics. Nanchang is one of several VR hubs across the country.\n\nSo far, VR is mostly a niche product used in gaming and business training, held back by expensive, clunky headsets, a lack of appealing software and other shortcomings. Analysts say it could be many years, perhaps decades, before the technology goes mainstream.\n\nLast year, just 5.8 million VR headsets were sold globally, according to market research firm Ovum. That compares with sales of more than 1.5 billion smartphones and is far fewer than expected when VR fever was at its peak a few years back.\n\n\"My experience wasn't good,\" said Xu Xiao, a PC gamer who bought VR goggles over a year ago after graduating from college. \"When I wore them, my eyes got dry and uncomfortable, and I got dizzy. I barely use them anymore.\"\n\nStopping by the Nanchang VR park, he was still unimpressed.\n\n\"The image quality isn't refined, and it's hard to operate,\" he said after a virtual flume ride.\n\nEven if it's a gamble, analysts say China's state-led push into VR could pay off in the future. Nanchang's VR developers are marching on despite a wave of layoffs across the industry in the past few years. Thousands attended Nanchang's first VR conference last October.\n\n\"It's kind of a good move to be there now,\" says George Jijiashvili, a senior analyst at Ovum. \"It's a long game, and I don't think it's going away anytime soon.\"\n\nBeijing still lags behind: Most VR headsets are designed by companies based outside mainland China like Samsung, HTC, and Oculus and the major VR content platforms are run by giants like Facebook and Google.\n\nChina's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology aims to change that by encouraging banks to finance VR startups and directing local governments to invest in VR products for public projects such as schools and tourist sites.\n\nThe government has provided subsidies and purchases of VR software, mostly focused on education, training, and health care software. Nanchang has a 1 billion RMB ($149 million) VR startup investment fund, and is setting up another fund to attract established VR companies.\n\nEntrepreneurs and experts believe VR will get a boost from next generation, or 5G, technologies where Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies are industry leaders. 5G promises blazing-fast connection speeds that could smooth lags and optimize multiplayer games and livestreaming so VR users might not end up with the headaches some get with today's technology.\n\n\"VR e-sports, broadcasting concerts in VR format, remote surgery -- all of this is only realistic in the 5G era,\" said Chenyu Cui, a senior analyst at IHS Markit. \"It'll make VR better for a mass audience.\"\n\nSince the main commercial market for VR is entertainment, many of China's VR content makers are game developers in Shenzhen or Beijing. They're subject to booms and busts and recently, business has been flagging.\n\nThe state support is helping to protect Nanchang's developers from the cycles of feast and famine, but for now the industry is in a lull, and Xiong, the VR entrepreneur, is focused on keeping his startup afloat.\n\nHis dream is that one day, China's bet on VR will turn his thirteen-person company into an industry giant.\n\n\"I look forward to the day we can go public,\" Xiong said, \"and become a role model for the whole province.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Yanan Wang contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By Hugh Hewitt Hugh Hewitt April 27 at 4:55 PM\n\nThe 2020 election isn't going to be close.\n\nThe first-quarter gross domestic product growth rate of 3.2 percent sets up the first reality that will be noted in November 2020 because it telegraphs where the economy will be then: not in recession. Recessions are charted when GDP growth is negative for two consecutive quarters or more. That can and has occurred in sudden fashion -- financial panics don't send \"save the date\" cards. But the economy over which President Trump is presiding is strong and getting stronger. Innovation is accelerating, not declining. A recession before Election Day looks less and less likely by the day.\n\nSmall wonder then that Trump dominates the GOP with an approval rating above 80 percent. His administration's deregulatory push is accelerating. More and more rule-of-law judges, disinclined to accept bureaucrats' excuses for overregulation, are being confirmed to the bench. Readiness levels in the U.S. military have been renewed. Our relationship with our strongest ally, Israel, is at its closest in decades.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dems are facing a Hobbesian choice of Sens. Bernie Sanders or Kamala D. Harris, or former vice president Joe Biden. Sanders and Harris are too far to the left, Sanders by a lot. Biden is far past his best years. The nice folk lower down are looking for other rewards. The nomination going to someone such as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is possible, I suppose, but what happens when the dog chasing the car catches it? What was an entertaining and amusing aside suddenly becomes a commitment and, with that, well, comes a barrage of attacks. Where Trump deflects incoming with ease, the Democrats scatter, some limping away, some blown out of the picture.\n\nThis will come as news to #Resistance liberals, who are certain Trump will lose, because they dislike him so much. They still haven't figured out that 40 percent of the country love him and at least another 10 percent are very much committed to considering the alternative in comparison to Trump, not reflexively voting against him. That decile is doing very well in this economy. Unemployment remains incredibly low. The markets are soaring. That's not a given for the fall of 2020, but better to be soaring than falling 18 months out.\n\nOn immigration, border security has always been a legitimate concern (and Immigration and Customs Enforcement a legitimate agency). People don't talk much about it as they decline to state anything that will earn them the label racist, but the reality of open borders is understood to be an unqualified disaster by most of the country, and most of the country understands the Democrats to be arguing for a de facto open-border system, if not a de jure one.\n\nThe Green New Deal sounds like a bad science-fair project where the smart kids got the colors to combine via an elaborate device and make all the \"lava\" flow black down the volcanoes' sides and the village is destroyed. Medicare-for-all is a Professor Harold Hill production, headed for Iowa as was the Music Man. There's not a lot of serious thinking or talking among the Ds about the People's Republic of China and the \"nine-dash line\" in the South China Sea (which many may think is some sort of shorthand for their marks on the debate stage), or Huawei, which is just too complicated to try to debate in five-minute exchanges. Sen. Elizabeth Warren's turn as Madame Defarge may even wake up some of the wealthy-woke to their peril. It's a circus coming to a cable-news network near you soon.\n\nLast week's message from a booming economy should have rocked the Democratic field. Alas, the party seems collectively intent on poring over the Mueller report yet again in the hope that, somehow, someway, there's something there. But the probe is over. No collusion. No obstruction. Democrats have to campaign on something else besides a great economy, rising values of savings, low unemployment across every demographic, clarity about allies and enemies abroad, and a rebuilding military. It's a tough needle to thread, condemning everything about Trump except all that he has accomplished that President Barack Obama couldn't or wouldn't.

Then, on Tuesday, American officials wrestled with allies over a United Nations measure on combating rape during wartime.\n\nAnd on Friday, President Trump announced he was \"taking our signature back\" from a global treaty on conventional arms sales that went into effect in 2014.\n\nAll of that, along with a shift last week on Cuba policy that angered European leaders, has reinforced the notion that the United States is becoming a rogue superpower as it continues to embrace unpredictable \"me first\" actions, with little care about upending the traditional world order.\n\nNew questions are being raised over whether the Trump administration is sacrificing what should be long-term priorities -- namely, countering China and Russia as outlined in the National Security Strategy -- for short-term obsessions with much weaker nations that pose no real threat to the United States, notably Iran, Venezuela and Cuba.\n\nThe relentless drive of Mr. Trump and his top foreign policy officials to pressure smaller nations has inflamed allies. The damage to relations will be difficult to repair even after Mr. Trump leaves office, diplomats warn, because of rising rancor and a huge erosion of trust that could lead allies to strengthen ties with other powers.\n\n\"You have a bad combination of unilateralism and narcissism,\" said William J. Burns, a deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration and a 33-year foreign service veteran who wrote in a new book about the decline of diplomacy under Mr. Trump.\n\n\"We're digging a hole for ourselves,\" Mr. Burns said. \"It's not like the rest of the world is going to sit by while we get our act together. So rivals take advantage. Allies start to lose faith and hedge.\"\n\nFrom Mr. Trump's perspective, the United States is tackling global issues in a realistic manner with his \"America First\" approach -- working with allies so long as it benefits American interests.\n\n\"Our mission is to champion the American way of life,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told State Department employees on Friday.\n\nBut in one notable example, the United States risked the cooperation of Turkey, South Korea, Japan and India on critical security issues when it expanded its ban on Iranian oil exports worldwide.\n\nTrump administration officials want to coordinate with India to counterbalance China, by far the greatest challenger to American supremacy. The United States is also working with South Korea and Japan to deal with both China and North Korea, which, unlike Iran, has a growing nuclear arsenal.\n\nAnd Turkey, a fellow North Atlantic Treaty Organization member, is a key partner in the effort to bring stability to Syria. Negotiations to keep Turkey from growing too close to Russia after its decision to buy a missile defense system from Moscow are also continuing.\n\n\"Turkey rejects unilateral sanctions and impositions on how to conduct relations with neighbors,\" the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said Monday on Twitter. Turkey is looking to continue buying Iranian oil even after its exemption from the sanctions ends on May 2.\n\nThe moves this month have strained relations well beyond the pain inflicted by the Mr. Trump's repeated denunciations of NATO allies and his withdrawals in 2017 from the global Paris climate agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nThe backlash is evident in growing resistance among European allies to American requests to reject technology from the Chinese company Huawei in next-generation 5G telecommunications networks. Meanwhile, officials from more than 150 nations are in Beijing for a conference on China's global infrastructure program, the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nThe Trump administration has done little to assuage European allies already on edge.\n\nMr. Trump lifted longstanding limits on American citizens suing over property that had been confiscated by the Cuban government after the Communist revolution. European officials strongly objected -- and threatened to sue the United States at the World Trade Organization -- over concerns the shift would harm foreign companies with ties to Cuba.\n\nAdministration officials threatened to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution, drafted by Germany, that sought to combat the use of rape as a weapon of war. The officials demanded the measure be stripped of language on reproductive and sexual health. Several top American officials are evangelical Christians, including Mr. Pompeo, and have taken strong stands on issues related to abortion. The Security Council approved the resolution on Tuesday in a significantly weakened form.\n\n\"The current president doesn't care about the West,\" the retiring French ambassador to the United States, G\u00e9rard Araud, said in an interview with Foreign Policy magazine. \"He is a nationalist. He is America alone.\"\n\nLatin American countries also are angered by the United States' increasing intractability, even as China tries to make inroads into the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe State Department is planning to cut aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador because of what Mr. Trump has called failures to stem migration to the United States. That has weakened American warnings about doing business with China and demands that Guatemala and Honduras continue to recognize the self-governing island of Taiwan rather than China. (El Salvador already switched recognition last year, prompting a rebuke from Washington.)\n\nBut nothing has strained relations between the United States and other nations more than the anti-Iran campaign led by Mr. Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser.\n\nWorld powers that entered the Iran nuclear deal with the United States in 2015 objected to Mr. Trump's withdrawal last year and the American sanctions that were later imposed. European nations have created a financial transaction system to continue doing business with Iran.\n\nIraqi leaders are defying American demands that they stop buying natural gas and electricity from Iran and cut ties with Iranian military officials. Iraq and the United States partnered in the fight against the Islamic State, an effort that was paralleled by Iran, which is an ally of Baghdad.\n\nIn India, officials were surprised and disappointed by the reversal on the Iranian oil purchase waivers, citing earlier assurances by Washington they would be allowed to continue buying the oil.\n\nA senior Indian official noted that New Delhi had shown loyalty to Washington. It was weighing ending all oil imports from Venezuela -- not because it agreed with the Trump administration's hard-line position on Venezuela, but because India considers the United States a strategic partner.\n\nThe Indian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also expressed disappointment in the Trump administration's decision in March to remove India from a trade program that gave the country tariff-free access to the United States. The same was done to Turkey.\n\nMr. Trump's aggressive approach to trade has irritated other partner nations, including Canada, France and Japan.\n\n\"You have a big stick, and you don't care who your interlocutor is,\" Mr. Araud said. \"You treat China the same way you treat the U.K. or the European Union.\"\n\nBoth South Korea and Japan have endured rounds of bilateral trade negotiations with the United States. And both also asked the United States not to end the Iranian oil waivers, as did China, Iran's biggest customer.\n\nThe United States needs help from those three nations to pressure North Korea to give up its dozens of nuclear weapons. Iran has no nuclear weapons and is not yet moving to develop any, according to American intelligence assessments.\n\n\"These decisions probably won't torpedo those relationships, but they will add to an already long list of bilateral irritants at a time when we need unity,\" said Kelly Magsamen, who was the Pentagon's top Asia-Pacific policy official at the end of the Obama administration.\n\n\"The biggest problem is that America is no longer consistent,\" she said.\n\nMr. Burns, the former American diplomat, said Mr. Trump would do well to remember that the United States is no longer the world's singular dominant player. That, he said, has raised the significance of global alliances and working with coalitions of countries.\n\n\"We have a window before us within which we can help reshape those institutions and that order before it gets reshaped for us by the rise of other powers and other events,\" Mr. Burns said. \"The problem is that window is not going to stay open forever.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "edward_wong@nytimes.com", "name": "Edward Wong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/26/us/politics/26dc-diplo1-sub/26dc-diplo1-sub-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 294004980}, {"uri": "1120135566", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-24", "time": "11:58:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-24T11:58:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.772549033164978, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2019/04/24/the-cybersecurity-202-dhs-is-pushing-cybersecurity-support-to-presidential-campaigns/5cbfb5981ad2e52459e24664/", "title": "Analysis | The Cybersecurity 202: DHS is pushing cybersecurity support to presidential campaigns", "body": "Christopher Krebs, director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is offering to help test and improve the cybersecurity of Democratic presidential campaigns -- and this time, these services are getting a lot of interest.\n\n\"We haven't had anyone decline to have a call with us or not be excited about the resources we're offering or the support or services,\" DHS senior adviser on election security Matt Masterson said of offers to the crowded field of 2020 candidates, during a panel discussion at the Atlantic Council's International Conference on Cyber Engagement.\n\nThat's a far better reception than ahead of the 2018 midterms, when state election officials broadly rejected DHS's offer to help with their cybersecurity early in the Trump administration. Despite the Russian hacking and influence operation that upended the presidential election, state officials were concerned DHS aid could lead to a federal takeover of election administration and were angered by the department's slow pace sharing information about Russia's 2016 hacking attempts.\n\nIt was well into 2017 before some states changed their tune and began working with DHS on girding their election systems against hacking from Russia and elsewhere in the midterm elections.\n\nNow, the acceptance of free help from DHS is a sign the campaigns and states are getting on the same page as the federal government about the need for security to protect both voter information and the integrity of the vote.\n\n\"They, I think, realize the risk and vulnerability that are out there and the need to secure their systems,\" Masterson said. \"We haven't had any conversations that suggest people aren't taking this seriously and don't see the real risks out there.\"\n\nDHS is offering campaigns all the services it offered to state election officials in advance of the 2018 midterm elections, including scanning their computer networks for bugs and doing more complex penetration testing, according to Chris Krebs, director of DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\nCampaigns are especially vulnerable to hacking because they form quickly with a mix of professional and volunteer staff -- many of whom many not be especially digitally savvy. They're also typically hyper-focused on winning votes, donations and news cycles to stay in the race, rather than on tedious administrative tasks such as ensuring everyone is following proper protocols before accessing sensitive databases or guarding against phishing emails.\n\nKrebs, on the sidelines of the Atlantic Council conference, declined to say which campaigns his division spoke with and which accepted CISA services. But said he hopes to work with all the presidential campaigns -- Democratic and Republican -- once the field of candidates is settled.\n\n\"If there are two high priorities on election security, it's state and local [election offices] and its campaigns,\" Krebs said. \"We will provide whatever services they request.\"\n\nThere could be trouble, however, if campaigns are wary of letting the federal government nose around computer systems that hold sensitive data such as donor information, opposition research on other candidates or campaign strategies.\n\nThat's the sort of information Russia or another adversary might be most interested in stealing -- either for blackmail or embarrassing leaks -- and in the greatest need of protection. But Democratic campaigns might also be wary of giving access to databases containing sensitive strategy documents to a federal agency that's part of the government of the opposition party -- and ultimately reports to a president who's running for reelection.\n\nAs the 2020 campaign progresses, Krebs said he'd consider creating an external organization that provides the same cybersecurity services CISA offers but doesn't report directly to DHS.\n\nA model for that organization could be the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, he said -- a nonprofit organization that receives federal government funding and shares cybersecurity threat information among federal, state and local governments.\n\nLiisa Past, a former Estonian cybersecurity official, described during the Atlantic Council conference the model that government uses to secure campaigns: Estonian government cybersecurity pros test every campaign website that touches the public Internet for vulnerabilities but don't touch any internal databases.\n\n\"We knock on the doors and windows, and that's worked very well,\" she said.\n\nOr, DHS could offer some cybersecurity aid with the assistance of organizations that have their own cybersecurity operations and strong relationships with campaigns, including Harvard's Defending Digital Democracy project or the Democratic and Republican National Committees, Krebs said.\n\n\"We'll be working through any option our stakeholders want,\" Krebs said. \"I'm based on demand signals, so if campaigns come and say, 'This is the capability we need,' we'll look at the feasibility of pulling it together.\"\n\nPINGED: Former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was barred from discussing possible Russian interference in the 2018 and 2020 elections in front of President Trump, the New York Times' Eric Schmitt, David E. Sanger and Maggie Haberman reported Thursday.\n\nNielsen, who the Times reported \"had become increasingly concerned about Russia's continued activity in the United States during and after the 2018 midterm elections -- ranging from its search for new techniques to divide Americans using social media, to experiments by hackers, to rerouting internet traffic and infiltrating power grids\" resigned under pressure earlier this month.\n\nHere are more details from the Times: \"In a meeting this year, Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, made it clear that Mr. Trump still equated any public discussion of malign Russian election activity with questions about the legitimacy of his victory. According to one senior administration official, Mr. Mulvaney said it 'wasn't a great subject and should be kept below his level.'\"\n\n\"Even though the Department of Homeland Security has primary responsibility for civilian cyberdefense, Ms. Nielsen eventually gave up on her effort to organize a White House meeting of cabinet secretaries to coordinate a strategy to protect next year's elections.\"\n\n\"As a result, the issue did not gain the urgency or widespread attention that a president can command. And it meant that many Americans remain unaware of the latest versions of Russian interference.\"\n\nPATCHED: The United Kingdom will allow Huawei to build part of its next-generation 5G telecommunications network despite U.S. pressure, the Wall Street Journal's Max Colchester and Dan Strumpf reported.\n\nBut the controversial Chinese telecom will only be allowed to build peripheral sections that perform less vital functions, the Journal reported.\n\nMore from the Journal: \"The decision is a victory for Huawei in its fight against a U.S. campaign to block the use of its 5G equipment in the networks of U.S. allies. The U.S. has long held that Huawei equipment is a security threat, which the telecoms company forcefully denies....The decision came at a meeting of Britain's National Security Council on Tuesday attended by Prime Minister Theresa May and several British government ministers.\"\n\n\"They agreed that Huawei should be allowed to participate in the construction of the network, but would be barred from involvement in its critical core, the official said. The decision wouldn't be final until announced before lawmakers in the House of Commons.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ciaran Martin, the head of GCHQ's National Cyber Security Center, downplayed the rift between the U.S. and its five main intelligence sharing partners over Huawei in a BBC Radio interview. \"It's objectively the case that in the past decade there have been different approaches across the Five Eyes and across the allied wider Western alliance towards Huawei and towards other issues as well,\" Reuters reported from the interview.\n\nPWNED: Krebs also revealed during the Atlantic Council conference that as soon as next week CISA will publish its list of \"critical functions\" that government and industry should prioritize protecting against cyberattacks.\n\nThe general idea of the list is that the \"critical infrastructure\" that DHS helps protect against physical and cyberattacks encompasses too much for the department to protect everything equally -- so it has to identify the most critical of the critical infrastructure.\n\nThe list, which Krebs said will include about 57 critical functions, is the first major output from CISA's National Risk Management Center, which the department launched last year to focus on long-range cybersecurity problems.\n\nKrebs didn't provide specific examples of critical functions, but said the benchmark is services \"that if interrupted ... would literally crater the economy.\" An example that Krebs and other officials have cited in the past is Global Positioning System data, which is vital to everything from trucking to financial transactions.\n\n-- Democrat and Republican leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee are demanding answers from Google amid privacy concerns about a database the company maintains of users' precise location information, according to a letter to CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nThe New York Times's Jennifer Valentino-DeVries profiled the database, which Google calls \"Sensorvault\" and which law enforcement frequently seeks information from during criminal investigations, earlier this month.\n\nHere are details from that report: \"For years, police detectives have given Google warrants seeking location data tied to specific users' accounts.\"\n\n\"But the new warrants, often called 'geofence' requests, instead specify an area near a crime. Google looks in Sensorvault for any devices that were there at the right time and provides that information to the police.... Google first labels the devices with anonymous ID numbers, and detectives look at locations and movement patterns to see if any appear relevant to the crime. Once they narrow the field to a few devices, Google reveals information such as names and email addresses.\"\n\nThe House committee's Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) and ranking Republican Greg Walden (Ore.) want to know how Google uses the database, what privacy protections it applies and whether it's storing other databases of location information.\n\nMore cybersecurity news from the public sector:\n\n-- Apple CEO Tim Cook lashed out during a Time magazine conference Tuesday at the FBI's 2016 attempt to force the company to help crack its own encryption during an investigation into San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook, saying it \"was a very rigged case\" and \"was not the government's finest hour,\" CNBC's Kif Leswing reported.\n\nAn inspector generals' investigation later revealed the FBI didn't explore all possible avenues before asking a federal judge to force Apple's cooperation, and several people inside the bureau believed the goal was to force a court precedent rather than to solve the specific case. The bureau eventually withdrew its case when a third party offered it a way to hack into the phone without Apple's assistance.\n\n\"I have personally never seen the government apparatus move against a company like it did here in a very dishonest manner,\" Cook said.\n\nMore cybersecurity news from the private sector:", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/79ebd12f5b234ae1730449eff132e5a5-5472-3648-70-8-ZEWTDOGVXYI6RA4EXTCUSL7PJE.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4750187", "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 293803080}, {"uri": "1119123162", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-23", "time": "09:23:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-23T09:23:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4588235318660736, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/when-hunger-for-fast-internet-collides-with-us-concerns-about-chinese-spying/2019/04/22/20bf17f6-5d29-11e9-98d4-844088d135f2_story.html", "title": "When hunger for fast Internet collides with U.S. concerns about Chinese spying", "body": "In German towns such as Tangerh\u00fctte, the need for dependable digital access has eclipsed U.S. warnings about Chinese tech company Huawei. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images) By Griff Witte and Griff Witte Europe-focused correspondent with extensive experience in the Middle East and South Asia Luisa Beck Luisa Beck Reporter covering Europe from The Washington Post's Berlin bureau April 23 at 5:00 AM\n\nTANGERH\u00dcTTE, GERMANY -- In a hollowed-out East German town where the factories closed long ago and the population dwindles with every death notice, Andreas Brohm sees the makings of a renaissance.\n\nTangerh\u00fctte could be a hub for wind energy. A center for server farms. A magnet for young professionals, like himself, who yearn for wide-open spaces to raise their kids, far from the cost and craze of life in the big city.\n\nIf only residents could get a decent cellphone signal.\n\n\"As the mayor of this town, I need communications. I need 5G,\" said Brohm, 40, in an interview at the town's century-old, red-brick town hall, where Internet connections are spotty. \"I don't care who provides it.\"\n\nBut the Trump administration does care.\n\nConcerned about the potential for cyberespionage, or even sabotage, the United States last month took the extraordinary step of telling the German government not to include the Chinese firm Huawei in its plans to roll out the next generation of Internet technology. If Germany ignores the advice, officials have warned, U.S. intelligence sharing could be at stake.\n\nExcluding Huawei carries its own risks. Service providers say that without the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, building a 5G network will cost far more and take years longer. In the places that need it most -- the towns and villages of the German countryside -- the promise of a digital revolution that could spawn a 21st-century revival may never be realized.\n\nThe collision of those concerns helps explain why Germany's decision on Huawei has proved so agonizing. For now, the government has avoided making one: It has declined to ban the firm outright, while setting what officials say is a high-enough standard for security that Huawei may struggle to clear it.\n\nBut ultimately, Germany -- along with governments across Europe -- will have to choose. And either way, there are likely to be significant costs.\n\nThe hit for Germany from a delayed 5G rollout could be especially acute.\n\nHuawei technology is already deeply embedded in Europe's communications networks, and German telecom companies fear they won't be able to deploy 5G without the help of the Chinese firm. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nAlthough the country is the undisputed economic titan of Europe, it is also a digital laggard. Germany has some of the lowest penetration rates for fiber-optic broadband among industrialized nations. A study last year revealed that people get speedier surfing on their phones in Albania than they do in Germany. Outside the big cities such as Berlin, Hamburg and Munich -- and sometimes even within them -- service is patchy at best.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel has said the country needs to scale up its digital performance or face a dire economic reckoning. \"Our future prosperity depends on it,\" she has told audiences.\n\nA rapid and comprehensive rollout of 5G -- thereby leapfrogging the anemic deployment of 4G technologies -- is seen by experts as the country's best hope to catch up to its peers and to help close the growing prosperity gap between urban and rural areas.\n\nThe first step in that push comes this spring, with the auctioning of 5G spectrum licenses. All of Germany's major telecommunications providers are bidding.\n\nBut they warn that they won't be able to deploy the new network -- billed as an exponential jump in connectivity that will open the door to autonomous vehicles, remote surgery and other transformational uses of technology -- without help from Huawei.\n\nExcluding the firm would be \"hugely disruptive,\" adding costs and delays that could set the project back years, Vodafone chief executive Nick Read told the Mobile World Congress in February.\n\n\"It structurally disadvantages Europe,\" he said.\n\nHuawei technology is already deeply embedded in European communications networks, with its stamp on everything from handheld devices to transmission towers.\n\nAn insistence that the firm's products play no role in 5G would mean that \"companies have to focus on removing technology from the network rather than building it out,\" said Nick Kriegeskotte, head of telecommunication policy with Bitkom, an industry trade group.\n\nThat's one reason Kriegeskotte doesn't expect Huawei, or any other major 5G technology maker, to be left out.\n\nMayor Andreas Brohm sees improving connection speeds and cellular reception as the keys to his area's economic revival. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nBut picking providers that include Huawei in their plans would further roil an already turbulent transatlantic relationship. U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell put Germany on notice last month with a letter to the economy ministry laying out a case for why the United States may not be able to continue sharing sensitive information if it doesn't feel it can trust the integrity of German communication networks.\n\n\"This could in the future jeopardize nimble cooperation and joint mobilization, particularly in times of crisis,\" the embassy said in a statement.\n\nGermany and other European allies rely heavily on U.S. intelligence, and any disruption to the sharing of sensitive information could be debilitating.\n\nGerman officials privately scoff at the U.S. threats, saying they don't believe the United States would actually curtail intelligence cooperation that is mutually beneficial.\n\nBut apart from the U.S. pressure, German security officials and experts say there is good reason to be wary of Huawei. The firm, they say, can't be trusted not to take part in surveillance or spying on behalf of the Chinese government, and a crucial role for the company in German communications networks could become leverage for China in geopolitics.\n\nWhen those factors are taken into account, said Free University Berlin computer science professor Matthias Waehlisch, Huawei's technology looks like much less of a bargain than the sticker price on its products would suggest.\n\n\"It's not only the money you pay for the equipment,\" he said.\n\nHuawei has mounted an aggressive campaign to rebut suggestions that it represents a security threat. In Bonn -- the old capital of West Germany and still home to numerous German federal agencies -- the company has set up a demonstration center where regulators can review the firm's source code.\n\nHuawei has also sent lobbyists to meet with lawmakers, though they have not always been convincing. Daniela Kluckert, a member of the German parliament with the pro-business Free Democrats, said that even after hearing the firm's pitch, she thinks Germany needs to be careful.\n\n\"It's more important to be safe than to have 5G cheaper and faster,\" she said.\n\nIn Tangerh\u00fctte, getting faster Internet is a matter of survival. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nBut Kluckert, who sits on a key committee with oversight of the 5G rollout, also said it is hard to overstate just how much Germany needs a tech upgrade -- particularly outside the big cities.\n\nIn Tangerh\u00fctte, a town of modest red-roofed buildings set amid endless green pastures 75 miles west of Berlin, getting faster Internet has become a matter of survival.\n\nThe town of nearly 11,000 has lost a third of its population in recent decades, as employers shuttered operations and young people sought better opportunities in bigger locales.\n\nBrohm, the mayor, initially was among those who left. He lived and worked across Europe, ending up in Berlin pursuing a career in musical theater.\n\nBut as rent climbed and Brohm's family grew to include three children, he wanted a return to the easier living and tightknit community of his youth. He proposed a move back to Tangerh\u00fctte, and his wife was receptive -- to a point.\n\n\"She said, 'If we can't have Internet in our home, I won't go with you,'\u2009\" Brohm recalled. \"People today can live without an opera house, a cinema, a concert hall. But they can't live without energy, water and broadband. The door to the world is the Internet.\"\n\nAs mayor, Brohm has led a crusade to improve connection speeds and cellular reception, believing those are the keys to the area's economic revival.\n\nThomas Krone, whose company makes metal fencing, says the region's poor digital infrastructure is preventing his business from growing. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nThomas Krone's experience shows why: The third-generation owner of a Tangerh\u00fctte manufacturing firm that dates to 1923, he sells metal fencing used in factories the world over. And he still does it much the way his grandfather did, by hand.\n\nWith faster Internet, he has dreams of expansion: an online shop, or maybe an automated production process.\n\nBut without an upgrade, Krone, 53, isn't sure there will be anything left to pass on to his kids. Clients are demanding ever-more-sophisticated practices, using 3-D designs, that just aren't possible when poor network connections make basic downloads an all-afternoon affair.\n\n\"We're in nowhere land,\" Krone said, motioning to the farmers' fields that encircle his warehouselike shop floor. \"It's not going to be possible to maintain this business without Internet.\"\n\nRead more\n\nHow China's Huawei took the lead over U.S. companies in 5G technology\n\nBritish spy agency delivers scathing assessment of security risks posed by Huawei to U.K. telecom networks\n\nU.S. officials planning for a future in which Huawei has a major share of 5G global networks\n\nThe Post's View: U.S. allies should heed the warnings about Huawei", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zi-usPexwHdpUNSPg2PTNwrPJ-w=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5PIIAIS5H4I6TGGUQRAIRUJV6I.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4743245", "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 293707380}]
