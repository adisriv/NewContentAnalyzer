Trump's new tech sector order could ripple through global supply chains.", "body": "A Chinese man is silhouetted near the Huawei logo in Beijing. (Ng Han Guan/AP) By Graham Webster May 18 at 12:18 PM\n\nThe gloves are coming off against Chinese tech giant Huawei. The Trump administration took two major steps on Wednesday to address long-standing U.S. government concerns about national security and information technology infrastructure from China.\n\nThe timing and content of the announcements makes it less likely the United States and China will soon reach a trade and economic agreement. And the potentially devastating effects on Huawei in particular could create ripple effects throughout global technology supply chains and hasten any potential \"decoupling\" between Chinese and U.S. tech ecosystems.\n\n[The Huawei arrest fallout leaves companies and countries with an impossible choice]\n\nThe U.S. government just claimed far-reaching powers over the tech sector\n\nIn the first of two major announcements Wednesday, the administration released an \"Executive Order on Securing the Information and Communications Technology [ICT] and Services Supply Chain.\" While many analysts consider this primarily a move to hem in Huawei, the broadly framed order gives the secretary of commerce and other officials extraordinary new powers over tech markets.\n\nThe U.S. government now can block or require conditions for transactions involving ICT products or services even tenuously linked to a \"foreign adversary\" - a category the executive order defines flexibly as a country, company or person \"engaged in a long-term pattern or serious instances of conduct significantly adverse to\" national security, or to security and safety of U.S. citizens or businesses.\n\nHere's what this means: The U.S. government is charged with stepping in to block or manage any transactions it deems as linked to a \"foreign adversary\" and overly risky for critical infrastructure, national security or the \"digital economy.\" If these terms seem vague, that's because they are.\n\nThe executive order leaves it to Commerce and other officials to identify \"foreign adversaries\" and sensitive transactions. Thus it does not name China or Huawei specifically - but the language largely parallels years of U.S. government warnings about the potential for Huawei equipment to be used for spying or sabotage if installed in sensitive U.S. networks.\n\nPublic warnings date back to a 2012 House Intelligence Committee report that urged against using equipment from Huawei or the smaller Chinese firm ZTE. With this week's order, the U.S. government is fully empowered to block U.S. companies from using Huawei equipment just as work begins on next-generation 5G wireless networks around the world.\n\n[Trump says 'America must win' the 5G race. Here's what you need to know.]\n\nSelling U.S. components to Huawei will be banned without a special license\n\nThe second U.S. move, also on May 15, was the Commerce Department's announcement that it would add Huawei to the government's \"entities list,\" potentially halting the company's access to U.S. suppliers.\n\nCiting Huawei's January indictment for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran, the government notice said U.S. companies will only be allowed to sell products to Huawei with a license, and license applications will start from the \"presumption of denial.\"\n\nIf the government were to deny all Huawei-related licenses, the fallout could be catastrophic for many of the company's product lines, which range from infrastructure-level network gear to smartphones. Here's why: Many of these products use computer chips or other specialized components from U.S. companies, some of which would be hard or impossible to replace with non-U.S. alternatives.\n\nWhen the government last year imposed similar measures against ZTE, the loss of U.S. suppliers led the company to announce a stop to \"major business operations.\" Only after President Trump intervened to reverse that order was ZTE saved from likely collapse.\n\nWhile Huawei may have greater ability to withstand shocks than the ZTE, losing access to U.S. suppliers would be a much larger hit than simply losing out on already-slim sales to the United States.\n\n[China's ZTE has long been on Washington's radar, for quite a few reasons.]\n\nThere are consequential choices ahead\n\nWhen it comes to the broad new regulatory powers of the executive order, the government has 150 days to develop more specific rules for implementation. Officials could structure their efforts in a targeted and transparent way - or they could give themselves broad and opaque authorities. One Department of Homeland Security official reportedly said the government would look broadly at risks, but said, \"I'm hoping we'll be able to narrow.\" Businesses and interest groups will be sure to make their voices heard.\n\nIn the case of Huawei's new life on the entities list, the U.S. government could be generous in issuing licenses to continue sales, or it could effectively block the company from all U.S. suppliers, cutting into the revenue of U.S. companies. Regardless, the uncertainty will encourage Huawei and other Chinese companies to seek alternative suppliers at home or anywhere else U.S. bans would not apply.\n\nHow U.S. officials make these choices will help answer several questions:\n\n1. How fast and how hard will U.S. supplier limitations hit Huawei? The Chinese company has reportedly stockpiled several months to a year's worth of some crucial components, anticipating this potential outcome. And Huawei's subsidiary HiSilicon is one of China's leading developers of semiconductors, though it lags behind the global leaders Huawei may need to replace. Time will reveal any real pressure points.\n\n2. Which U.S. companies stand to lose out, and how badly? Big names such as Qualcomm, Seagate and Intel are among Huawei's top U.S. suppliers, by revenue. But the smaller optical technology company NeoPhotonics, which pulls in 47 percent of its revenue from Huawei sales, according to Reuters data, could be in particular jeopardy.\n\n3. How will this ripple through global telecom providers? One potential goal of the broader U.S. campaign against Huawei could be to undermine confidence in the company's long-term viability. Huawei is currently among the global leaders in 5G equipment. But continued services and upgrades are crucial for network providers, so extra caution among customers worldwide could slow wireless upgrades overall.\n\n4. How will this impact the U.S.-China economic divide? A deal many analysts believed was imminent reportedly fell through last week over China's refusal to commit to revising a number of domestic laws. The decision to ratchet up the anti-Huawei campaign at this particular moment could draw retaliation against U.S. interests - and it risks driving the two sides further apart, while pushing any trade deal further into the future.\n\nIndeed, if the two sides move much further down the path of antagonism, there may be no deal at all. Then again, just as the Trump administration stepped back from the brink with ZTE, it could change course here once again.\n\nDon't miss anything!

Now They're Not So Sure.", "body": "BEIJING -- Qi Haohan describes with pride the times he has leaped and pirouetted with American dancers across stages in China, and he counts as a major influence Daniil Simkin, a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theater.\n\nAsk him about China's trade war with the United States, however, and Mr. Qi's admiration for America evaporates.\n\n\"Fight, fight, fight!\" the 25-year-old wrote on social media, urging his country to stand strong after trade talks with the United States broke down.\n\n\"America's decision to increase tariffs will only bring about its own destruction,\" Mr. Qi, a dancer with the National Ballet of China, said in an interview. \"China is totally ready to respond.\"\n\nMr. Qi's views are an example of the complex, sometimes contradictory attitudes toward the United States held across China -- a love-hate relationship that presents an unusual challenge to the ruling Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping, as they try to defend their image at home amid the bruising trade war.\n\nDivided popular opinion -- and ambivalence about America, even among some of its most ardent fans (and critics) -- makes it difficult for Beijing to come down too hard on the United States. But if it does too little, the party risks looking weak.\n\nChinese people have long looked to America as a source of inspiration, with its gleaming skyscrapers, financial power and unparalleled military might. But they also increasingly see it as a strategic rival -- a view partly fueled by pride in China's rise, and by the party's propaganda organs, which have long depicted America as a hostile, imperialist country that has tried to keep China down.\n\n\"China now has the No. 2 mentality,\" said Yun Sun, a China analyst at the Washington-based Stimson Center. \"It's only natural for No. 2 to want to surpass No. 1.\"\n\nEven in China's authoritarian political system, public opinion must be carefully managed. If leaders push an anti-American message too far, they run the risk of nationalist sentiment spiraling out of control. That would limit their options in talks with Washington by forcing them to adopt a tough posture.\n\nThough China has ways to prop up its economy, there are deep-seated concerns that it is not ready for a prolonged standoff, which could exact a heavy toll on people's livelihoods. That could ultimately backfire on the party, which has staked its legitimacy on generating continuous economic growth.\n\nOn the other hand, if Chinese leaders act too cautiously, they could look inept to a domestic populace that has, in recent years, become more self-assured about China's status as a rising power.\n\nWhat was once starry-eyed enthusiasm for America among many Chinese has given way to sober admiration, if not outright disillusionment, as people have gotten to know the United States better and its problems have come into clearer view.\n\nAccording to the latest nationwide survey by the Pew Research Center, published in 2016, 45 percent of Chinese saw American power and influence as a major threat to their country, up from 39 percent in 2013. More than half of Chinese believed the United States was trying to prevent China from becoming as powerful as America, the survey found.\n\nThat trend may well have accelerated over the past year, which has seen the world's two largest economies go head-to-head in a protracted trade war and a dispute over Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant. The United States has also tightened restrictions on visas for Chinese students and visiting scholars, measures it says are aimed at curbing intellectual property theft and spying.\n\nSuch developments have reinforced the Chinese perception that the United States is deliberately thwarting their country's rightful rise -- leaving China with no choice but to fight back.\n\n\"We are not scared. China has money,\" said Amanda Lin, 36, as she sipped an Americano at a Starbucks in Beijing. She said the Chinese manufacturing company she works for had been badly hit by the latest round of tariffs. \"Perhaps we have to sacrifice a little in the short term, but if we don't fight, then we will suffer more in the longer term,\" she said.\n\nSkepticism about American intentions taps into China's collective memory of the 19th century, when Western powers forcibly opened Chinese ports and carved up the country into spheres of influence. Nowadays, China is a fast-modernizing nation, home to a booming middle class and cutting-edge infrastructure.\n\nBut many Chinese still remember their outrage when the United States accidentally bombed China's embassy in Belgrade in 1999, during the war in the former Yugoslavia. The bombing, which killed three Chinese people, prompted days of violent protests. Two years later, tensions flared again when China detained a United States Navy flight crew after a Chinese fighter and an American spy plane collided in midair.\n\nChina has ratcheted up anti-American propaganda in recent weeks, but its campaign has been comparatively restrained. Still, the authorities, ever wary of unrest that could be turned against the government, are taking few risks.\n\nChen Chun, a liberal political columnist in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, said he was recently pulled in for a meeting with local security officials who urged him to take a more moderate tone in his writings.\n\n\"They said that Chinese people are easily instigated and that emotions can get really complicated,\" Mr. Chen said.\n\n\"On one hand, the authorities want to use nationalism to legitimize their regime,\" he added. \"But if the nationalists spin out of control, it can also affect their power and the system's stability.\"\n\nThe party may also be reluctant to play up China's rivalry with America, knowing that affection here for the United States -- whose Chinese name means \"beautiful country\" -- still runs deep.\n\nAmerican culture is so deeply embedded in China, experts say, that it would be impossible to boycott the country's products, as China has done with goods from Japan and South Korea when tensions with those countries ran high. Many Chinese love their iPhones and lobsters imported from Boston, and are fans of American television hits like \"House of Cards\" and \"Modern Family.\"\n\nThe affinity extends beyond products. Many Chinese still admire America for its education system, strong rule of law and soft-power dominance. Some continue to draw inspiration from the idea of the American dream.\n\n\"The American dream means working hard and achieving your goals one step at a time,\" said Kobe Liu Zhe, 29, a Kobe Bryant superfan in the northeastern city of Harbin who recently made headlines in America after he unknowingly bought the National Basketball Association star's stolen high school jersey. (He later returned it.) \"Kobe Bryant represents that dream.\"\n\nAnd yet, while the United States remains one of the top destinations for Chinese tourists, business travelers and students, the growth in that traffic is slowing. The increase in the number of Chinese visitors to the United States fell sharply from 16 percent in 2016 to only 4 percent in 2017, according to the United States Commerce Department.\n\nThe slowdown has been even more apparent in education. The increase in the number of Chinese students going to America has slowed from a high of nearly 30 percent in 2010 to just 3.6 percent last year, according to the Institute of International Education.\n\nThe decline, experts say, partly reflects a growing belief that America's star is losing its luster.\n\n\"Thirty years ago, a lot of people thought that going to the United States was like going to heaven,\" said Liu Peng, an education consultant in the eastern city of Qingdao. \"But now people think the United States is falling behind while China is growing.\"\n\nEven if a trade deal is reached soon, experts say party leaders are bracing for a prolonged period of competition with America. Preparing public opinion for that future, some say, will require adjusting to the younger generation's increasing cultural confidence.\n\n\"The older generation of Chinese both respect and fear the United States, we were brought up to think America was superior and we were the underdog,\" said Wang Xiaodong, a nationalist writer. \"But the perspective of young Chinese is different. They don't respect you. Nor are they afraid of you.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_qin@nytimes.com", "name": "Amy Qin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/world/19china-lovehate-1/00china-lovehate-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4796639", "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 295860720}, {"uri": "1139004489", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-18", "time": "04:28:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-18T04:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4705882370471954, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/australia-holds-elections-with-labor-party-looking-to-regain-power/2019/05/17/f661d2ea-7705-11e9-a7bf-c8a43b84ee31_story.html", "title": "Australia holds elections with Labor Party looking to regain power", "body": "By A. Odysseus Patrick May 18 at 12:01 AM\n\nSYDNEY -- Climate change, China and a chance at political stability took center stage among Australian voters Saturday with polls suggesting the left-leaning Labor Party was in a strong position to flip the country's leadership.\n\nSuch an outcome would offer a counternarrative to the rise of nationalists and conservative groups across the West and elsewhere.\n\nA Labor victory in Australia also could provide a morale boost for U.S. Democrats and other left-of-center parties around the world, including the British Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn, which has long had close ties to its Australian counterpart.\n\nOn China, it would also put Australia possibly at odds with the United States as the Trump administration steps up tariffs and pressure against Chinese technology giant Huawei.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security said it was adding Huawei to its \"entity list\" over worries of potential -- but unspecified -- security risks. The listing makes it virtually impossible for companies to survive in the U.S. market.\n\nAustralia's government, led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, has placed restrictions on some Chinese investments and effectively banned Huawei from Australia's 5G telecommunications network.\n\nBut Labor leader Bill Shorten has suggested Australia needs to recalibrate its relationship with China, saying Australia must take a more rounded approach in its dealings with Beijing and not only view it \"through the prism of strategic risk.\"\n\nShorten's promises of a wider social safety net, support for renewable energy and government stability -- after six prime ministers in eight years -- have resonated strongly across the country.\n\nThe Labor Party wants Australia to generate half of its electricity from solar, wind and other renewable sources by 2030, a huge shift for a nation with the world's fourth-largest coal reserves and the eighth-biggest natural-gas industry.\n\nLabor's popularity also has been boosted by its foreign policy chief, Penny Ying-Yen Wong, a Malaysia-born lawyer who has a wide following and is seen as a top candidate to become foreign minister.\n\n[Australia's new political star once faced scorn as a gay immigrant]\n\nThe Labor Party has promised more free health care, greater spending on education and tax cuts for the middle and working classes. The wealthy should be forced to pay higher taxes and unions should be given more power, it has said.\n\nThe Liberal and National parties also have pledged to bring tax cuts, although both have been ridiculed for offering much of the reductions until 2024, which would be after at least one more national election.\n\nEnvironmental policies are possibly the biggest difference between the two sides.\n\nTo encourage new sources of power, Labor has promised to subsidize the purchase of solar-panel batteries by individual homes. It also has said it will introduce a compulsory carbon-trading system for some 250 companies responsible for the greatest emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nPollution-emissions standards for vehicles also would be toughened to encourage the purchase of electric cars, a policy the current government says threatens many Australians' love of trucks.\n\nThe election comes just days after the death of one of Australia's transformative political figures, former prime minister Bob Hawke.\n\nHis wife, Blanche d'Alpuget, announced the death Thursday of the 89-year-old Hawke, but did not give a cause. In Hawke's last public statement, he issued an open letter urging voters to support Shorten .\n\nHawke, who served as prime minister from 1983 to 1991, was widely regarded as the most successful Labor politician in Australian history and was known for integrating the country into the global economy, forging alliances with Asian nations and strengthening ties with world powers such as the United States.\n\nRead more\n\nOpinion: Can a politician take on Murdoch's empire?

This week's newsletter features some additional highlights from our conversation. Some of Mr. Trudeau's comments have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\n-- Mr. Trudeau on what mistakes he made in the SNC-Lavalin affair:\n\nOne of the things I don't regret, even though a lot of people criticized me for it, is having taken as much time as I did to get to an eventual decision.\n\nI talked to a number of my predecessors from different parties who expressed how quickly they would turf out of caucus someone who was so openly antagonistic.\n\nBut I really believed that doing politics differently means trying to reconcile differences and trying to hold together people who do agree on the big things. And I spent weeks trying to figure out a constructive path forward. Old-school politics would have been to say: \"O.K., I'm going show strength as a leader, make a decision and move on.\" We gave lots of room for lots of airing of different perspectives and that, I think, is consistent with doing politics differently.\n\n-- On criticisms that he can no longer claim to offer a fresh approach to politics:\n\nI think in terms of the team we have within caucus, they have come through this and we are united as a team more than we ever were.\n\nThere's lots of things that we're doing to try and make sure it never happens again. But it's part of doing things differently that you are learning new mechanisms for handling internal conflict like this.\n\nWe continued to do really big things while the media and opposition were being distracted with this internal disagreement that has been invented and amplified. We're going to stay focused on the things that matter, and I have a tremendous amount of faith in Canadians.\n\n-- On whether he was offended by President Trump's personal attacks:\n\nI don't take things personally. My job is to stand up for Canadians and I will do that regardless of what outbursts happen. I've been in the public eye too long to feel like I can be defined by what anyone else says about me.\n\n-- On relations with the United States:\n\nIt's not a terrible situation. We're not at a particular low in the relationship. I still pick up the phone and talk to President Trump every few weeks on any number of issues and we have a very positive relationship.\n\nWe're very different in our approaches and in our ideologies. But we also know the relationship between the two countries is bigger than any one person and, because of that, we get along as fine as we need to.\n\n-- On anticipating the end of the election campaign:\n\nIt's going to be a fun year. Simple rule of politics: Whoever is actually having more fun, Canadians respond to better. We're doing good things, we're actually having fun. We went through these more difficult moments, and as a team and party we managed to stay positive.\n\nI'm happy about coming to work every day. I'm excited about the challenges we face. This is what democracy is supposed to be: a contrast of ideas and a choice between different visions for this country. And with what we've been able to achieve and what we're continuing to stay focused on, despite some noise.\n\nFinally, a bit of trivia. The closing of Parliament's Centre Block for renovations meant that Mr. Trudeau has moved into a different office in the West Block. It's been widely reported that Mr. Trudeau's father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, used the same office when he was justice minister. But Mr. Trudeau said that he learned from an aunt that his grandfather, James Sinclair, also occupied the high-ceilinged space during the 1950s, when he was fisheries minister.\n\nIn Conversation With Wesley Morris\n\nHaving survived a \"Game of Thrones\" immersion, Wesley Morris, a critic at large for The New York Times and the co-host of \"Still Processing,\" will join the CBC broadcaster and writer Amanda Parris in Toronto on May 28.

But a ban will not make American networks more secure. Instead, it will hurt ordinary Americans and businesses by denying them access to leading technology, reducing competition and increasing prices.\n\nThe ban will financially harm the thousands of Americans employed by the U.S. companies that do business with Huawei, which buys more than $11 billion in goods and services from U.S. companies each year. A total ban on Huawei equipment could eliminate tens of thousands of American jobs.\n\nBecause Huawei equipment is installed in dozens of 4G networks in underserved remote and rural parts of the country, a ban would prevent small, independently owned American telecom operators such as Eastern Oregon Telecom and Union Wireless in Wyoming from developing new services and delivering faster broadband connections to millions of people. Instead, those operators would be forced to spend their limited funds replacing Huawei equipment with more expensive gear supplied by its competitors (there are two -- Ericsson and Nokia -- and neither is an American company).\n\nHuawei is the acknowledged industry leader in 5G technology. Blocking it could harm the American economy by preventing the United States from keeping pace with the rest of the world in rolling out 5G networks. The United States could end up falling behind the many European and Asian countries that plan to introduce 5G networks -- ensuring that those countries take the lead in delivering new products and services to their residents, just as American companies did when the country moved quickly to roll out 4G, the previous generation of wireless tech.\n\nMost important, a ban would fail to achieve its goal of making the country's digital networks more secure.\n\nAmerican officials worry that using Chinese equipment would allow Beijing to shut off phones, power, banking and other critical services. The security of our telecommunications networks is a responsibility shared by operators, equipment vendors and service providers to collectively perform risk mitigation with assurance and transparency. Telecom operators control the network and the data moving across it, and circumventing their controls would be extremely hard, given the available risk-mitigation processes. Huawei has repeatedly said it would refuse any order to attack or spy on its customers.\n\nMoreover, singling out Huawei because it is headquartered in China makes little sense. Telecommunications companies such as Nokia and Ericsson draw from a global supply chain, as Huawei does. They use equipment developed or manufactured in China, which accounts for much of the telecommunications and internet gear currently installed in American networks. Blacklisting one company -- or all of the companies from one country -- does nothing to mitigate this global supply chain risk and will substantially reduce competition that will inevitably increase costs.\n\nThe executive order and the Commerce Department's regulation aim to prevent malicious actors from inserting malware into telecommunications networks that could surreptitiously monitor network traffic or launch a cyberattack. This aim reflects the reality that the world's communications networks are vulnerable to attack by sophisticated nation-states, such as by implanting programmable code and exploitable vulnerabilities in hardware and software by virtual means. But such code can compromise the product of any equipment vendor -- even those from countries that might seem friendly to America -- which requires assurance and transparency in risk mitigation.\n\nRelatedMore about China and HuaweiHuawei Is a Target as Trump Moves to Ban Foreign Telecom GearMay 15, 2019Trump's Latest Move Takes Straight Shot at Huawei's BusinessMay 16, 2019Opinion | Bret StephensWhat's Our China Endgame?May 16, 2019\n\nThe United States government has entered into agreements for government-monitored risk mitigation with Nokia and Ericsson, which are based in Europe, allowing them to do business in this country despite their extensive operations in China. Huawei would welcome the opportunity to discuss similar agreements.\n\nIf the White House and Commerce Department really want to protect American networks, they will focus not on barring individual companies but on establishing a comprehensive risk management approach that relies on recognized best practices. In fact, that is precisely the strategy advocated last year by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nA move to block any company -- let alone Huawei, the industry leader -- will weaken competition, delay 5G adoption, reduce innovation and prevent American consumers and businesses from having access to some of the world's most advanced communications technology. The Trump administration should abandon its apparent course and instead develop a transparent framework to test and secure all parts of America's communications networks.\n\nCatherine Chen is director of the board at Huawei.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Genie Back in Its Bottle", "body": "Each week, we review the week's news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nHi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news:\n\n\"The facial recognition genie, so to speak, is just emerging from the bottle,\" Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, wrote in December, when he called for regulation of the technology.\n\nSan Francisco just put it back in.\n\nOn Tuesday, the city's Board of Supervisors banned the use of facial recognition software by the police and other city agencies in an 8-to-1 vote. Supporters said its use by government was an invasion of privacy incompatible with healthy democracy. Departments will now need to first submit proposals and post public notices to use the technology. Private-sector and federal use isn't affected.\n\nThat the ban was introduced by San Francisco, a city pivotal to the development of the technology, was viewed by some as a siren call. \"This is like Detroit banning a certain model of vehicle because it's too dangerous,\" said Alvaro Bedoya, a visiting professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center. \"You may not live in Detroit, but, boy, you'd think twice before getting in that car.\"\n\nExpect more cities to follow: Somerville, Mass., outside Boston, is considering something similar, and Brian Hofer, a paralegal who drafted the San Francisco ordinance, is pushing for other anti-surveillance measures across California.\n\nLike it or not, it's a rare sign that technologies viewed as threats to citizens' well-being can be blocked. \"The decision refutes a defeatist and widespread opinion that once a technology is established, you can't stop it in its tracks,\" said Evan Selinger, a philosophy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology.\n\nMore than an app fight\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court allowed an antitrust class action lawsuit against Apple, giving consumers an opportunity to try to prove that the iPhone maker used monopoly power to raise prices of iPhone apps.\n\nAs my colleagues Adam Liptak and Jack Nicas reported, the lawsuit focuses on the fact that Apple charges developers a commission of up to 30 percent for selling products through its App Store, bars them from selling the apps elsewhere and plays a role in setting prices.\n\nApple claims that it is a middleman: that customers buy software from the app developers. But the court, in a 5-to-4 ruling, said iPhone owners had a \"direct purchaser\" relationship with Apple, so they had the right to sue.\n\nIt's interesting that the decision went against Apple at all. Liberal jurists often favor antitrust action, and conservatives avoid it. So you'd have expected the verdict to be 5-to-4 in the other direction, along the conservative-liberal line of the Supreme Court.\n\nBut the new justice, Brett M. Kavanaugh, tipped the other way.\n\nYou could read Justice Kavanaugh's decision as an indicator that, as people of all political stripes begin to find Big Tech troublesome, conservatives may accept that antitrust could be a useful tool in curbing its power. If that's accurate, Big Tech should be very concerned.\n\nBreaking up Facebook? Godspeed\n\nIn 2019 there's little more fashionable than calling for Facebook's dismantlement.\n\nThis past week, Senator Kamala Harris and Joseph R. Biden Jr., two of the Democrats running for president, said it should be considered, joining another, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has called for wider Big Tech breakups. And don't forget that Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, wrote this month that he wanted its split up, too.\n\nWe could argue (at length) about the validity of the idea. But how plausible is it?\n\nThe weapon of choice behind most of these calls is antitrust law. Fine. There's plenty of potentially anticompetitive behavior to go after. But in terms of end results, a breakup is possible, but by no means certain, from such legal action, according to antitrust experts I spoke with.\n\nEiner Elhauge, a Harvard law professor who was chairman of the antitrust advisory committee to the Obama campaign in 2008, told me that splitting WhatsApp and Instagram from Facebook -- the most popular proposal -- was plausible but might depend on how deeply integrated they had become.\n\n\"It's hard to unscramble eggs,\" he said. And Facebook's push to intertwine the platforms more closely may make such unscrambling only harder.\n\nHarry First, a law professor at New York University who specializes in antitrust, said breaking up what then remained of Facebook would be \"problematic and expensive,\" making it unlikely.\n\nMore skeptical was Diana L. Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, who said that for any antitrust action, \"the remedy has to be applied specifically to the harm; it cannot be a broad remedy.\" That means that \"it may not even include breaking up the company,\" but would instead involve something less severe, like conduct requirements.\n\nMr. First agreed that injunctions and the formal monitoring of conduct were \"much more likely\" outcomes than a breakup.\n\nSo if an antitrust argument is used to break up the social network, it's not guaranteed to have the desired outcome. But, as Mr. First told me, for those who want it, \"it's good to have a goal.\"\n\nTrump's social media priorities\n\nOn Wednesday, more than a dozen countries, including Britain, France and Germany, signed a nine-point plan with big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter to address extremist and violent content. A notable absence: the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration cited free-speech protections for not signing, saying that \"the best tool to defeat terrorist speech is productive speech.\"\n\nThe same day, the White House unveiled a bias reporting tool that enables people to report, to the government, censorship that they believe is a result of political bias on social networks. That thrusts into the public domain a widely held view among Republicans that platforms like Facebook and Twitter censor conservative viewpoints.\n\nAs my colleague Kevin Roose pointed out, that looks like a savvy collection tool for voter data. But it's also an interesting, if not particularly surprising, demonstration of the priorities of the Trump administration.\n\nSome stories you shouldn't miss\n\n\u25a0 Uber bombed its I.P.O.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThe White House hasn't said how it plans to use the data it's collecting about people's experiences with bias on social media. But in Silicon Valley, it's viewed as the administration's latest political stunt.\n\nVenky Ganesan, a partner at technology investor Menlo Ventures, told me the White House's new survey about bias on social media is \"pure kabuki theatre\" and an attempt to curry political points with conservatives. He said the Trump administration's repeated accusations that tech companies censor conservative voices are unfounded because even though most Silicon Valley executives are liberal or libertarian, they wouldn't let politics get in the way of their primary goal: making money.\n\n\"Algorithms and products don't have political biases because that's not how you optimise to make money,\" he wrote in an email. \"The only bias the products have is to monetise users and make money for the companies.\"\n\nThe Internet Association, a trade association representing Facebook, Google and other tech companies, also pushed back on President Trump's repeated accusations that their products are biased against conservatives. The association says the platforms are open and enable the speech of all Americans -- including the president himself.\n\n\"That's why the president uses Twitter so much,\" said Michael Beckerman, the Internet Association's chief executive. \"He actually used Twitter for this particular announcement, which is perhaps ironic.\"\n\nSilicon Valley is punching back as the Trump administration opens a new battleground in its tense war with the tech industry. But this time some of Silicon Valley's typical Washington foes -- privacy advocates and Democrats in Congress -- are on the tech industry's side, underscoring the broad criticism of the plan.\n\nThe Trump administration launched a tool allowing users to submit their experiences with what it described as bias on Wednesday evening, following years of President Trump's repeated threats to regulate the companies for stifling conservative voices. The Trump administration declined to tell my colleague Tony Romm what it planned to do with the data it's amassing. \"The White House wants to hear from all Americans -- regardless of their political leanings -- if they have been impacted by bias on social media platforms,\" spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.\n\nPrivacy advocates want answers about how the data is being handled -- and until they get them, they think the White House should stop using the tool. A consumer privacy nonprofit organization wrote a letter to Trump yesterday calling for the White House to halt the collection of personal information. The White House submission form requests respondents share their name, age, email addresses, phone number, citizenship status and links to their social media profiles and posts.\n\n\"The White House seeks to collect detailed sensitive personal information, yet there is no indication that privacy interests were considered,\" the Electronic Privacy Information Center wrote. The group also said the form raises \"substantial First Amendment concerns\" and that it believes the data collection is \"unlawful, unconstitutional and itself a violation of the First Amendment.\"\n\nEPIC is arguing that the federal agencies are required to conduct a privacy impact assessment before collecting personal data of this nature, and there's no indication the White House conducted such a review before launching the tool.\n\nOn the Hill yesterday, Democratic lawmakers say the survey raises serious questions about government ethics and abuse of power, according to Politico.\n\n\"I think it raises questions related to the abuse of power,\" Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) told reporters on Capitol Hill yesterday. \"If it's not authoritarian, it's the first or second cousin of authoritarianism.\"\n\nBITS: U.S. tech companies could be impacted if a ban on exporting hardware and services to Chinese-based Huawei goes into effect, highlighting U.S. dependence on China's tech industry, my colleagues Greg Bensinger and Reed Albergotti write.\n\nHuaewei says it spends $1 out of every $7 of its annual $70 billion procurement budget buying components from U.S. companies. Huawei relies on U.S. suppliers for wireless chips, antennas and handset operating software -- and the ban could weaken its ability to produce the latest equiptment.\n\nHuawei says the ban, which hasn't yet taken effect, could threaten U.S. jobs.\n\n\"This decision is in no one's interest,\" spokesman Chasen Skinner said in an email to my colleagues. \"It will do significant economic harm to the American companies with which Huawei does business, affect tens of thousands of jobs, and disrupt the current collaboration and mutual trust that exist on the global supply chain.\"\n\nRepresentatives for U.S. suppliers, who did not want to be identified, told my colleagues they were uncertain about the lasting impact of the Huawei ban on their operations.\n\nThose companies would have to apply to the government for special approval to continue supplying Huawei, Center for Strategic and International Studies adviser William Reinsch, a former Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration, told my colleagues.\n\n\"That doesn't mean every license would be denied, but it would be on a case-by-case basis,\" he said. \"It also gives the government an intelligence bonanza\" in the form of a list of every U.S. supplier to Huawei.\n\nNIBBLES: Facebook said it shut down 265 fake accounts run by a social media company in Israel for \"coordinated inauthentic behavior,\" signaling the increasingly global nature of social media disinformation, my colleagues Craig Timberg and Tony Romm report.\n\nFacebook's announcement was atypical because it singled out a company that appeared to profit from its disinformation efforts. Archimedes Group, the affected company, claims the ability to \"use every tool and take every advantage available in order to change reality according to our client's wishes.\"\n\nThe accounts were on Facebook and Instagram, which the social network also owns. Archimedes Group is banned from both services.\n\n\"We're taking down these Pages and accounts based on their behavior, not the content they posted,\" said a post by Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of global cybersecurity policy. \"As in other cases involving coordinated inauthentic behavior, the individuals behind this activity coordinated with one another to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing, and that was the basis for our action.\"\n\nArchimedes Group maintained 65 Facebook accounts, 161 Facebook pages, 23 Facebook groups and four Instagram accounts. It also had posted 12 Facebook events. About 2.8 million accounts followed at least one of the pages set up by the Archimedes Group. Facebook said the company's accounts bought $812,000 in ads using various currencies, dating back to 2012.\n\nArchimedes Group did not respond to a request for comment my colleagues made through its website.\n\nBYTES: More than half a dozen recruiters who recently left Facebook say the company saw a sharp decline in job offer acceptance rates after the public learned of the Cambridge Analytica scandal in March 2018, CNBC's Salvador Rodriguez writes.\n\nStudents at top universities are turning down job offers from the embattled social network at higher rates.\n\n\"Among top schools, such as Stanford, Carnegie Mellon and Ivy League universities, Facebook's acceptance rate for full-time positions offered to new graduates has fallen from an average of 85% for the 2017-2018 school year to between 35% and 55% as of December, according to former Facebook recruiters,\" Rodriguez writes. \"The biggest decline came from Carnegie Mellon University, where the acceptance rate for new recruits dropped to 35%.\"\n\nThe company also saw a decline in acceptance rates among software engineers for its products teams. Acceptance rates for those teams declined from 90% to almost 50% in early 2019.\n\nFacebook spokesman Anthony Harrison told CNBC the company's head count grew 36% year over year from the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019. Facebook disputed the accuracy of the recruiters' accounts, but declined to point out any specific points that were wrong. Harrison contacted CNBC after the story was published to say \"these numbers are totally wrong.\"\n\n\"Facebook regularly ranks high on industry lists of most attractive employers,\" Harrison said in a statement. \"For example, in the last year we were rated as #1 on Indeed's Top Rated Workplaces, #2 on LinkedIn's Top Companies, and #7 on Glassdoor's Best Places to Work. Our annual intern survey showed exceptionally strong sentiment and intent to return and we continue to see strong acceptance rates across University Recruiting.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/19a3a61642101ec360dc266cf76b3f6d-5309-3539-70-8-ZG5R4MDYEMI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4791294", "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 295793640}, {"uri": "1138453374", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-17", "time": "11:41:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-17T11:41:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5882353186607361, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2019/05/17/the-cybersecurity-202-florida-lawmakers-rail-against-fbi-for-secrecy-on-voter-breaches/5cddf475a7a0a435cff8c0a8/", "title": "Analysis | The Cybersecurity 202: Florida lawmakers rail against FBI for secrecy on voter breaches", "body": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and officials from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement were briefed by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security. (Brynn Anderson/AP)\n\nFlorida lawmakers are railing against the FBI for taking more than two years to acknowledge Russian hackers penetrated some of the state's voter files -- and for remaining mum about which voters were affected.\n\nThe long delay signals to voters in Florida and elsewhere that the government won't level with them if and when their votes are manipulated, the lawmakers say.\n\nAnd that lack of public faith could do just as much damage as the Russian hacking and disinformation operation that upended the 2016 election and cast doubts on the legitimacy of President Trump's victory.\n\n\"This lack of transparency is counterproductive,\" Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D) told me. \"I'm really concerned that it can erode public confidence in the integrity of our elections almost as much as the actual hacking did.\"\n\nThose concerns about election integrity could be especially damaging in Florida, which was the site of a hotly contested recount between George W. Bush and Al Gore in 2000 and is frequently a decisive state in close presidential elections.\n\n\"Florida is the country's largest swing state ... so we can't afford to have the integrity of our democratic process be compromised or have Floridians be concerned about their vote,\" Murphy said.\n\nMurphy and other Florida lawmakers announced plans to introduce legislation to mandate speedy FBI reporting to state and local government officials and to members of Congress about election-related breaches in their districts, as my colleague Karoun Demirjian reported.\n\nThe lawmakers, who also include Reps. Michael Waltz (R) and Matt Gaetz (R), are trying to get as much of the Florida House delegation to co-sponsor the bill as possible along with lawmakers from outside Florida. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) is \"looking into\" sponsoring a Senate version of the bill, a spokesman told me, but didn't provide additional details.\n\nWhile the bill will focus on notifying government officials, Murphy told me, she expects those officials will make the information public as quickly as possible.\n\n\"We have a responsibility to our constituents to make sure we do everything we can to ensure the integrity of their votes,\" she told me.\n\nThe lawmakers' announcement came after a secretive FBI briefing on the breaches that lawmakers say penetrated voter rolls in two Florida counties before the 2016 contest but didn't result in votes being changed.\n\nThe lawmakers were barred from naming the counties where breaches occurred but my colleagues Karoun and Ellen Nakashima reported one of them was Washington County in the Florida Panhandle, with a population of about 25,000 people.\n\nThe public first learned about the breaches from Robert S. Mueller III's report, which revealed that the FBI believed Russian hackers penetrated county-level networks in \"at least one\" Florida county. Gov Ron DeSantis (R) disclosed the hackers penetrated voter files in two counties after his own FBI briefing Tuesday.\n\nThe FBI assured DeSantis that county officials were aware of the breach, he said.\n\nThe federal government has a spotty track record when it comes to telling state and local officials about election security issues.\n\nIt wasn't until September 2017, more than 10 months after the 2016 election, that the Department of Homeland Security officially notified election leaders in 21 states that Russian hackers probed their election networks.\n\nAnd officials in Illinois -- where Russian hackers breached a statewide database and made off with the personal data of tens of thousands of voters -- didn't get official confirmation about the breach until Mueller's team indicted those hackers in July 2018.\n\nDHS has been working hard to improve communication since 2017, including by creating a dedicated \"information sharing and analysis center\" for election infrastructure and granting more full and temporary security clearances to state election officials.\n\nBut even those efforts have focused mostly on sharing information with government officials rather than the public. That's not sufficient for the Florida lawmakers, Murphy told me.\n\n\"Just like consumers expect credit card companies to disclose when their personal information is breached ... when a voter's data is breached by a foreign actor, they have a right to know that,\" she said.\n\nPINGED: A bill being prepped for introduction this morning by 38 Senate Democrats - including all seven presidential candidates -- would deliver $1 billion to improve the cybersecurity of election systems across the nation plus $175 million in additional state election security grants every two years.\n\nThe Election Security Act, which was introduced in the House on Monday, comes two years after a Russian hacking and disinformation campaign in 2016.\n\nThe bill, which doesn't have any Republican sponsors, is mostly about signaling Democrats' seriousness about election security. Senate Rules Committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) has said he doesn't expect to hold hearings on any election security bills this Congress because he doesn't think Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) will bring them to a floor vote.\n\nThe Election Security Act basically peels the election security provisions from H.R. 1, a catch-all bill of progressive legislation Democrats introduced soon after retaking the House in 2018. It includes a mandate that states use paper ballots or have paper backups and imposes minimum cybersecurity standards on state and local election systems. It also requires voting system to be tested 90 days before an election and a report on election interference threats by U.S. intelligence agencies 180 days before an election.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), a 2020 presidential candidate and ranking member of the Rules Committee, is spearheading the Senate legislation. Other sponsors include 2020 presidential hopefuls Michael (Bennet (Colo.), Cory Booker (N.J.) Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Kamala Harris (Calif.)

Lynch David J. Lynch Financial writer covering trade and globalization May 16 at 8:05 PM\n\nPresident Trump's latest swipe at China suggests that more than a year of negotiations aimed at a sweeping trade deal with Beijing may instead produce agreement only on the terms of an economic divorce.\n\nThe relationship between the two nations hasn't deteriorated to quite that point -- yet. But on Thursday, tensions ratcheted up again as China vowed to take \"all necessary measures\" in response to the administration's latest action, which placed the Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei Technologies on a U.S. export blacklist.\n\nThe move against one of China's most prominent companies, a politically connected symbol of the Chinese government's aspirations to technology leadership, upended prospects for an early resumption of negotiations and appeared to invite a harsh Chinese response.\n\n[As Trump fights with China over trade, U.S.-China economic relationship is already being redefined]\n\nIt also led some analysts to warn that after four decades of ever tighter economic ties, the Trump administration might seek to decouple the world's two largest economies -- a step that could shake the global economy.\n\n\"The United States could not have taken a more provocative action against China's economy,\" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"This action is potentially devastating not only to Huawei the company but to the networks around the world that run on Huawei equipment. This action certainly now puts the entire economic relationship up on the table.\"\n\nTrump was personally involved in the deliberations over punishing the Chinese company. He arrived late to a Roosevelt Room meeting Wednesday about his immigration plan, saying he had been working on China trade issues. The president acknowledged that China would be unhappy with his Huawei decision, saying it could complicate trade negotiations.\n\nBut he described the decision as unavoidable, repeatedly remarking that China is taking over the world because of its technical prowess.\n\n\"Unless we stand up now, there's not going to be a chance to do it in the future,\" the president said, according to one attendee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a confidential conversation.\n\nWith Trump scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in six weeks at the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, the timing of the strike against Huawei puzzled many observers. \"I was surprised by the timing,\" said Dennis Wilder, a former China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency. \"Is this just Trump giving himself another card to play? Or has he come over to the side of those in the administration who favor decoupling?\"\n\nDerek Scissors, a China expert and occasional administration adviser who has called for the United States to cut ties with China, said the president did not support a full rupture and was simply \"arming himself for Osaka.\"\n\nThe trade talks themselves are on life support. After Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers this week that U.S. officials planned to return to Beijing soon for more bargaining, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday he didn't know what the treasury chief meant.\n\n[Under Trump, the U.S. enters a new 'Cold War' with China]\n\nThe United States and China are starting to resemble \"a very, very unhappy divorced couple that has to share the house for financial reasons and engages in constant warfare over who gets to sit on the couch and control the television remote,\" said Henry Farrell, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University.\n\nStill, any attempt to disentangle the two giant trading partners would be daunting.\n\nU.S.-China merchandise trade has nearly tripled since 2004 to a total of $660 billion last year. Cargo moving between the two countries represents roughly one of every six U.S. dollars.\n\nThe interdependence also is financial: China holds more than $1.1 trillion in U.S. Treasurys, making it the largest single foreign holder of the government securities.\n\nAs post-Mao China embarked on economic reforms starting in the late 1970s, U.S. presidents of both parties celebrated the potential gains for American companies and anticipated that Chinese political liberalization would follow.\n\nBut under Xi, China has taken an authoritarian turn, while Trump has emphasized the need to resolve long-standing U.S. complaints about Chinese trade-secret theft and discrimination against foreign companies. Washington also now sees China much more as a strategic adversary than a potential partner, further encouraging advocates of decoupling.\n\nThe Commerce Department action against Huawei capped years of U.S. government unease about the security implications of doing business with the company, the largest telecommunications equipment maker in the world.\n\nBoth the Obama and Trump administrations worried that Huawei could engineer technological back doors in its equipment that would permit Chinese officials to spy on Americans or, in times of conflict, disrupt or paralyze critical U.S. networks.\n\n\"Huawei is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interest,\" the Commerce Department said in announcing that it was adding the company and its affiliates to the \"entity list.\"\n\nAs a result, any company that wants to sell American technology to Huawei must first obtain a government license -- a requirement that threatens to sever the Chinese company's U.S. supply lines.\n\nOn Wall Street, investors broadly took the latest trade-war drama in stride, though companies that supply Huawei took a beating. The Dow Jones industrial average rose almost 215 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 25,862.68.\n\n\"The US-China economic relationship is too important -- and has the potential to generate too much wealth -- to be sacrificed for short-term protectionism,\" Jim Glassman, head economist with JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking, wrote Thursday in a research note. \"Neither side would benefit from disrupting the flow of trade or reversing the integration of the global economy.\"\n\n[Trump takes aim at China's tech sector. That could hurt U.S. innovation.]\n\nThat may or may not be the Trump administration's view. Over the past year, the administration has taken a number of steps to slow or reverse economic integration between the United States and China.\n\nThe screening process for Chinese companies' proposed U.S. investments has gotten tougher. New regulations to limit the export to China of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and robotics are being drafted. And Washington is getting stingy with visas for Chinese academics, students and business people.\n\nTrump's serial tariff rounds also have U.S. importers paying the highest average duties in more than a quarter century, according to Scotiabank, a Canadian bank.\n\nAdministration officials have adopted an increasingly harsh tone toward China since a landmark October speech at the Hudson Institute by Vice President Pence, warning companies of the dangers of doing business with China, including forced technology transfer, rampant theft of intellectual property and cyberespionage.\n\n\"China seems determined to steal its way up the economic ladder at our expense. .\u2009.\u2009. The reality is that some of these threats are existential threats to them as a business,\" FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said in April.\n\nEven if the trade talks produce a meaningful accord, both countries are likely to take divergent paths in areas including the development of advanced technology.\n\nTrump's advisers from the outset have been split over the goal and extent of the trade rebalancing with China. Mnuchin is among those seeking to preserve lucrative trade and investment ties. Others such as Peter Navarro, director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, want to return lost factories to American soil.\n\n\"It just seems like a total misunderstanding of reality,\" said Carlos Gutierrez, chairman of Albright Stonebridge Group and commerce secretary in the George W. Bush administration. \"So much of what happens here starts in China. .\u2009.\u2009. It is unrealistic to assume that we can take all those supply chains that we built over there and somehow separate ourselves from China.\"\n\nU.S. efforts to limit China's global economic role already have stumbled. Despite high-profile warnings about Huawei, the United Kingdom and Germany refused to exclude the company from supplying their 5G networks.\n\nLikewise, Italy, another U.S. ally, brushed aside Washington's objections and joined Xi's signature global infrastructure program, the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\n\"China is not decoupling itself from the world. If anything, China is tying itself to the world even more,\" said Gutierrez. \"At a time when there are people whispering in the president's ear that we can decouple ourselves, it seems like strategic suicide.\"\n\nJosh Dawsey contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oEnQNzEg9gjPVnp6JBis81n83BE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5CUHQKDX5AI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4786358", "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 295750260}, {"uri": "1137958134", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-16", "time": "22:36:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-16T22:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/16/trumps-huawei-sanctions-underscore-us-dependency-china-tech/", "title": "Trump's Huawei sanctions underscore U.S. dependency on China tech", "body": "Telecommunications firm says it spends more than $1 out of every $7 buying components from U.S. firms.\n\n(Thomas Peter/Reuters) By Greg Bensinger and Greg Bensinger Reporter covering algorithms and artificial intelligence Reed Albergotti Reed Albergotti Reporter covering consumer electronics May 16 at 6:20 PM\n\nU.S. suppliers to China-based Huawei would be affected quickly if a ban on exporting hardware and services proposed by the U.S. Commerce Department Wednesday goes into effect.\n\nThe telecommunications company said Thursday it spends more than $1 out of every $7 of its annual $70 billion procurement budget buying components from U.S. firms. Huawei is dependent on U.S. suppliers for components including wireless chips, antennas and handset operating software, meaning the ban could also cripple its ability to continue producing the latest equipment.\n\nHuawei immediately pushed back against the directive, which has not yet taken effect, saying it threatens U.S. jobs.\n\n\"This decision is in no one's interest,\" said spokesman Chasen Skinner in an email. \"It will do significant economic harm to the American companies with which Huawei does business, affect tens of thousands of jobs, and disrupt the current collaboration and mutual trust that exist on the global supply chain.\" He didn't respond to a request for further comment.\n\n[Trump administration cracks down on giant Chinese tech firm, escalating clash with Beijing]\n\nHighlighting the risk to American companies, investors punished several Huawei suppliers Thursday by selling off shares. Little-known network gear manufacturer NeoPhotonics' stock price closed down 20 percent, while semiconductor firm Qorvo was off 7.1 percent. Qualcomm fell 4 percent.\n\nThose stock prices fell following the Trump administration's decision Wednesday to add Huawei and about 70 affiliates to its so-called \"Entity List,\" which precludes the company from acquiring equipment from U.S. firms without government approval. It's the latest broadside to the Shenzen-based company, which U.S. officials have said represents a security threat because of its ties to the Chinese government. Huawei has denied those allegations.\n\nThe company has been in U.S. crosshairs for years over claims it could use its network equipment to spy on foreign nations, prompting network providers AT&T and Verizon to ban the sale of their handsets. In its statement Thursday, Huawei said it would \"seek remedies immediately\" and \"endeavor to mitigate the impacts of this incident.\"\n\nSuch trade bans can be crippling. Trump last year restricted ZTE, another Chinese telecommunications company, from doing business with American firms over violating U.S. sanctions with Iran and North Korea. That effectively prevented the firm from manufacturing new equipment. The administration ultimately lifted its limits on ZTE, which agreed to pay a fine and restructure its management.\n\n[Trump says he'll spare Chinese telecom firm ZTE from collapse, defying lawmakers]\n\nRepresentatives for U.S. suppliers, who did not want to be identified, said they were unsure about the lasting impact of the Huawei ban on their operations.\n\nThose companies and potentially dozens of others would have to apply to the government for special consideration to continue supplying Huawei, said Center for Strategic and International Studies adviser William Reinsch, a former Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration.\n\n\"That doesn't mean every license would be denied, but it would be on a case-by-case basis,\" he said. \"It also gives the government an intelligence bonanza\" in the form of a list of every U.S. supplier to Huawei.\n\nForeign companies who rely on U.S. firms for 25% or more of their components would also likely be subject to the disclosure requirements, said Reinsch.\n\nCustomers using Huawei's mobile handsets could also face disruptions in their operating software, said industry observers. The company relies on Google's Android software and licenses certain Google apps, like those for mapping, in its markets outside of China, said Chetan Sharma, a wireless industry consultant.\n\nHuawei may not be able to get updates to those apps, or allow customers to access the Play app store, if Google is not granted a reprieve from the Commerce Department order, said Sharma. \"It would start to impact new handset sales very quickly,\" he said. \"Huawei would essentially be a sitting duck.\"\n\nIn-app purchases could be rendered impossible if transactions routed through Google's servers aren't permitted.\n\nGoogle spokesman Colin Smith said he didn't have an immediate comment.\n\nAttempts by other firms to create a third operating system to compete with Android's or Apple's iOS have largely fallen flat in the western world, meaning Huawei would have few options to make its mobile phones relevant to customers.\n\nThere was broad confusion, though, on exactly how the restrictions on Huawei might work. One supplier representative, who asked not to be named, said for example that U.S. chips made in Taiwan could still be sold to Huawei, even though they were designed by U.S. companies. That would spell good news for U.S. chip makers that supply Huawei. It would also be a relief to Huawei, because chip design is one of area where Chinese companies still lag behind the U.S.\n\nNelson Dong, a partner at law firm Dorsey and Whitney LLP, disagreed with that assessment. A chip designed mostly within the U.S. would make it a U.S. product, even if the chip itself was manufactured elsewhere. \"It's a product made from U.S. technology,\" he said, and therefore would be prohibited to companies on the entity list. Even so, he said, some companies decline to sell to customers who are on the restricted list, even if the sale could be defended legally.\n\nMost U.S. technology companies have compliance departments that maintain lists of customers restricted by U.S. export sales. Before selling technology products, it's common to run the customer through a database to ensure the sale doesn't violate any U.S. restrictions. As of Thursday, Huawei had not officially been added to the list of restricted companies. Companies may have already started scaling back production in anticipation, experts said.\n\nThe Chinese company and its top executive are also being prosecuted for allegedly violating the U.S. sanctions on Iran and for stealing trade secrets from competitors and partners.

They were the biggest drags on the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index.\n\nOptical components maker NeoPhotonics Corp was the biggest loser, with its shares falling 16.3%.\n\nAnalog Devices and Finisar Corp was down about 2.5% while Skyworks Solutions shed 4.8%, Qorvo was down 5.9%, laser sensor maker Lumentum Holdings fell 9%, and memory chipmaker Micron Technology lost 2.7%.\n\nThere are also growing signs the U.S.-China trade war could filter into the broader economy.\n\nWalmart Inc said prices for shoppers will rise due to higher tariffs on Chinese goods even as the world's largest retailer reported on Thursday its best comparable sales growth for the first quarter in nine years.\n\nWalmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters the company will seek to ease the pain, in part by trying to buy from different countries.\n\nTARIFFS\n\nAs negotiations toward resolving the trade war stalled last week, the United States ramped up the pressure by raising tariffs on a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25% from 10%.\n\nChina, which views the U.S. decision last year to impose tariffs as the genesis of the trade war, retaliated this week with higher duties on a revised list of $60 billion worth of U.S. products.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has embraced protectionism and accused China of engaging in unfair trade practices, has threatened to put 25% tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.\n\nWith few options left for levying tariffs on U.S. goods, China could opt for other ways to pressure the United States, including blocking corporate mergers and other deals.\n\n\"There's other things they can do, and M&A would certainly be one thing,\" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein.\n\nWhile the United States wants significant changes in China's approach to intellectual property rights and state subsidies as part of any trade deal, Beijing is insisting that all tariffs be eliminated.\n\nThe two sides are also at odds over how much more in U.S. goods China would have to agree to buy as well as how balanced the text of the draft trade agreement should be, Vice Premier Liu He, China's lead trade negotiator, said last week.\n\n(Reporting by Yawen Chen and Se Young Lee and Diane Bartz; Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington, Stephen Nellis and Noel Randewich; in San Francisco and Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Writing by Chris Sanders and Paul Simao; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall)", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@nytimes.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 295734480}, {"uri": "1137860921", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-16", "time": "19:39:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-16T19:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/16/basketball-castles-river-boats-look-inside-huaweis-sprawling-europe-inspired-campus-china/", "title": "Basketball, castles and river boats: A look inside Huawei's sprawling, Europe-inspired campus in China", "body": "A Huawei security guard stands outside a gate at the sprawling Ox Horn Research and Development campus on April 24 in Dongguan, near Shenzhen, China.

This week, the Trump administration penalized Huawei by adding the company to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security's \"Entity List.\" As The Washington Post reported, some call the list the \"death penalty\" because of how hard it makes it for companies to prosper once U.S. firms are discouraged from working with them.

It has all but snuffed out the Chinese tech giant's sales in the United States, calling the firm an espionage threat. And it has tried to convince other governments to do similarly.\n\nBut Washington had not taken a straight shot at Huawei's ability to do business anywhere in the world until late Wednesday, when the Commerce Department announced restrictions on the company's access to American technology.\n\nAmerican companies including Qualcomm, Intel and Broadcom sell Huawei microchips and other specialized parts that go into its smartphones and telecom equipment. Google's Android software powers its phones. Of the $70 billion that Huawei spent on components and other supplies last year, $11 billion went to American companies, a Huawei spokesman, Joe Kelly, said.\n\nIf Huawei is cut off from these suppliers, the effect could be catastrophic for the millions of people who use Huawei smartphones -- and for the mobile networks, across a wide swath of the planet, that run on Huawei gear.\n\nIt would be \"the trade equivalent of a nuclear bomb,\" said Kevin J. Wolf, a partner at the law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and a former assistant secretary of commerce under President Barack Obama.\n\nMuch remains unclear, however, about the scope and potential impact of the Commerce Department's move. The department says it is putting Huawei on its \"entity list\" of firms that need special permission to buy American components and technology. How it decides to grant such permissions, and how broad a range of products the policy covers, will determine how badly Huawei's business is disrupted.\n\nGiven the spiraling tensions between China and the United States on tariffs, the move against Huawei may also be short-lived. Talks to resolve the trade fight have stalled, and both sides are digging in their heels. The pressure is on to find common ground ahead of a potential meeting next month between President Trump and China's top leader, Xi Jinping, in Japan. Washington's campaign against Huawei could become a bargaining chip.\n\n\"In every other administration, the entity listing was purely a tool of law enforcement and national security,\" Mr. Wolf said. \"The thing to watch is whether this will become a tool of trade policy and used as leverage in the negotiations.\"\n\nHuawei did not have immediate comment about the Commerce Department's move. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Commerce condemned it in regularly scheduled news briefings on Thursday.\n\n\"We urge the United States to stop these wrongful practices and to create favorable conditions for normal cooperation between the two nations' companies,\" said Gao Feng, a spokesman for China's Commerce Ministry.\n\nTensions between the Trump administration and Huawei escalated after American officials arranged the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the company's chief financial officer and a daughter of its founder, in Canada late last year. The company and Ms. Meng face criminal charges in the United States in connection with alleged theft of industrial secrets and violations of sanctions against Iran. Ms. Meng remains in Canada while officials there decide whether she will be extradited.\n\nWashington's action this week against Huawei puts the company in the same position that ZTE, a much smaller Chinese rival in telecom equipment, found itself in a few years ago.\n\nThe Commerce Department added ZTE to the entity list in 2016 after determining that it had violated United States sanctions by selling American-made goods to Iran. Eventually, the department relented, and ZTE agreed to a hefty fine. But a year later, the Commerce Department said ZTE had failed to comply with the terms of the agreement, and American technology companies were barred outright from selling to the company.\n\nCut off from American microchips and other parts, ZTE halted production and was near collapse until President Trump intervened and softened the punishment to appease the Chinese leadership.\n\nThe episode galvanized China's government and business community. It revealed the extent to which the country's growing technological prowess had been built on American know-how, and how important it was for China to innovate on its own if its economy was to thrive.\n\nHuawei also got a stark demonstration of the power Washington wielded over it.\n\nThe company has since stockpiled components \"for uncertain times,\" Guo Ping, a Huawei deputy chairman, told reporters in March. The firm has also worked to build up a geographically diverse network of suppliers, Mr. Guo said.\n\n\"Huawei has made sustained and deep investments over the past 30 years, and I believe that has been of great help to Huawei's global supply,\" he said.\n\nIn particular, the company has invested for many years in producing its own microchips, a key area in which most Chinese firms are laggards. Sravan Kundojjala, an analyst based in Hyderabad, India, with the technology research firm Strategy Analytics, estimates that three-quarters of the smartphones that Huawei ships today contain chips developed in-house.\n\nMr. Kundojjala acknowledges that he was skeptical when Huawei's semiconductor unit, HiSilicon, began building its own high-end smartphone chips.\n\n\"Initially, I thought this was not going to work out,\" he said. \"It's maybe a pet project. Maybe they just want to play games with their suppliers.\"\n\nInstead, HiSilicon has become a formidable asset for Huawei, with chip technology that analysts say rivals that of market leaders such as Qualcomm.\n\nYet Huawei still depends on American suppliers for enough critical components that an all-out export ban from Washington would create a sizable headache, even if it does not lead to near-ruin as it did for ZTE.\n\n\"When you've got something as complicated as router or a cellphone, even if there's one part you're not able to get, you can't deliver, because you don't have that widget to make the cellphone or router function,\" Mr. Wolf, the lawyer, said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "raymond_zhong@nytimes.com", "name": "Raymond Zhong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/16/business/16HUAWEI/16HUAWEI-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4786358", "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 295710240}, {"uri": "1137556826", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-16", "time": "12:55:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-16T12:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4313725531101227, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-technology-202/2019/05/16/the-technology-202-a-researcher-is-still-surfacing-videos-of-the-christchurch-attacks-on-facebook-and-instagram-two-months-later/5cdcc65da7a0a435cff8c07f/", "title": "Analysis | The Technology 202: A researcher is still surfacing videos of the Christchurch attacks on Facebook and Instagram two months later", "body": "A researcher is still spotting videos of the Christchurch shootings on Facebook and Instagram -- two months after the New Zealand attacks that killed 51 and spurred technology companies and governments to pledge more vigilance about the spread of hate online.\n\nAs of yesterday, there were at least two videos of the shootings available on Instagram and two videos available on Facebook, according to Eric Feinberg, a researcher and chief executive of GiPEC, a cyber\u00adintelligence start-up that tracks harmful activity on tech platforms. Facebook removed all four videos yesterday afternoon after the Technology 202 reviewed them and reached out to the social network for comment.\n\nFeinberg says he detected the videos by hunting for obvious hashtags -- searching for the terms such as \"New Zealand mosque attack\" in various languages, including Arabic. (He used similar techniques to identify posts about drugs on social media). Feinberg says if he can find these posts independently, it casts skepticism on the efficacy of Facebook's recent investments to improve its ability to moderate violent content on its platform.\n\n\"I think it's just appalling,\" Feinberg said. \"They've been on notice that these exist.\"\n\n\"You would think that with the 30,000 moderators they have that they would put a full court press on this,\" he added. The teams working on safety and security at Facebook are now more than 30,000, and about half this team are content reviewers -- a mix of full-time employees, contractors and companies.\n\nFacebook has struggled to keep up with the deluge of Christchurch shooting videos that were posted to its website after the alleged gunman used Facebook Live to broadcast the shooting in real time. Even after that video was removed, copies were already saved, and posted across a wide range of social media services, including YouTube and1.5 Twitter. Facebook says it continues to try to stamp out videos of the shooting -- but it hasn't shared data about how many of those videos it's still blocking or removing since it said it removed 1.5 million videos in the first 24 hours after the attack.\n\n\"We continue to automatically detect and prevent new uploads of this content on our platforms, using a database of more than 900 visually unique versions of this video,\" Facebook spokeswoman Sally Aldous said. \"When we identify isolated instances of newly edited versions of the video being uploaded, we take it down and add it to our database to prevent future uploads of the same version being shared.\"\n\nFacebook added the videos the Technology 202 flagged to its database so that future uploads will be prevented.\n\nOne of the major challenges for Facebook has been a proliferation of many different variants of the video, which people edited. Facebook deployed a number of techniques to find these variants, but says it is investing $7.5 million in new research projects to allow it to detect manipulated media and better distinguish between unwitting posters and intentional adversaries. The company also introduced new restrictions on Facebook Live to try to prevent other violent events from being live broadcast in the future.\n\nGoogle and Twitter have also struggled to police the proliferation of the video. Feinberg said he did not find any copies of the video still available on these platforms in recent days.\n\nFacebook announced these changes as it joined several other companies and foreign governments in signing the Christchurch Call yesterday -- a global pledge to stamp out violent extremism online. Companies including Amazon, Google, Twitter and Microsoft, promised to work more closedly with each other and governments to prevent their sites from fostering terrorism.\n\nThe pledge is largely symbolic because the document is non-binding. The White House did not sign onto the pledge after Trump administration officials said free-speech concerns prevented them from formally approving it.\n\nFeinberg says \"there's no teeth\" in the pledge, and he believes it's time for Congress to overhaul Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a legal provision that gives the technology platforms broad immunity for the content that third parties post on their sites.\n\n\"It's not for the White House to comment, it's for Congress to legislate Section 230,\" he said.\n\nThere's growing support in Congress for an overhaul to the law in the wake of the New Zealand attacks. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said on a recent podcast that the provision's future \"could be a question mark and in jeopardy.\"\n\nBITS: The Trump administration stepped up its war with Facebook, Google and Twitter yesterday as it called on Internet users to fill out a form if they feel they'e been censored by the tech giants, my colleague Tony Romm reports. The unprecedented ask follows President Trump's long-running complaints that these services are biased against conservatives.\n\nThe White House says the effort is directed at users \"no matter your views.\" On Twitter, the White House shared an online survey, which asks people to submit their name, contact information and other details. The form asks people to detail problems with censorship on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.\n\nThe tool in which users can complain can be found here.\n\nThe White House also asked those filling out the form whether they wanted email newsletters about \"President Trump's fight for free speech,\" so the administration \"can update you without relying on platforms like Facebook and Twitter.\" Tony notes in his story that President Trump is a prolific tweeter, often blasting his thoughts to his more than 60 million followers.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on how it plans to use the data and whether it intends to try and regulate the companies.\n\n\"The White House wants to hear from all Americans -- regardless of their political leanings -- if they have been impacted by bias on social media platforms,\" spokesman Judd Deere told Tony in a statement.\n\nThe companies have repeatedly denied they censor content on their platforms due to political motives.\n\nTech industry observers were very skeptical of the administration's announcement. Kevin Roose of the New York Times noted the tool may be a means for the White House to build a contact list:\n\nBuzzFeed's Ryan Mac said:\n\nPeople also pointed out the many technical shortcomings of the tool. Daily Dot politics editor David Covucci noted the survey had a unique test for whether respondents were robots:\n\nNIBBLES: The Trump administration hit the Chinese tech firm Huawei with an extreme penalty that will limit its ability to do business with U.S. companies, my colleagues Damian Paletta, Ellen Nakashima and David J. Lynch report.\n\nThe Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security said it is adding Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. to its \"Entity List,\" which my colleagues note is known to some as the \"death penalty.\" The Commerce Department said it added the company to the list because Huawei \"is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interest.\"\n\nThe telecommunications giant with significant backing from the Chinese government has been in regulators' crosshairs. The Justice Department has accused the company of violating Iran sanctions, among other things.\n\n\"President Trump has directed the Commerce Department to be vigilant in its protection of national security activities,\" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.\n\nThe move came right after Trump signed an executive order that expands the government's ability to protect communciations networks. You can read more about that from my colleague Joseph Marks in the Cybersecurity 202 today.\n\nBYTES: The White House declined to sign the Christchurch Call to stamp out extremism online -- in yet another example of the U.S. standing at odds with its closest allies, my colleagues Tony and Drew Harwell report.\n\nThe White House said free speech concerns prevented U.S. officials from formally signing onto the pact endorsed by other world leaders, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Jordan's King Abdullah II. French President Emmanuel Macron and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern organized the gathering in Paris where the pact was unveiled.\n\n\"The White House felt the document could present constitutional concerns, officials there said, potentially conflicting with the First Amendment, even though Trump previously has threatened to regulate social media out of concern that it's biased against conservatives,\" my colleagues wrote.\n\nFacebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Twitter joined the pledge, promising to collaborate with each other and governments to stamp out terrorism on their services.\n\n\"It is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,\" Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter said in a joint statement.

The CAC 40 in France was 0.4% higher at 5,397. U.S. stocks were also poised to open modestly higher, with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures up 0.3%.\n\nStocks have been volatile all week amid conflicting signals over the U.S.'s trade position. Some comments from the Trump administration have been positive for stocks, while others have shaken markets.\n\nOn Thursday, China protested the Trump administration's decision to issue an executive order apparently aimed at banning equipment sold by telecoms gear maker Huawei from U.S. networks. It also subjected the Chinese company to strict controls on U.S. exports.\n\nHuawei, the biggest global maker of switching equipment for phone and internet companies, has spent a decade fighting accusations it facilitates Chinese spying.\n\nMarkets have swung wildly in recent weeks as trade tensions between the U.S. and China intensified. The Trump administration more than doubled tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports and spelled out plans to target the $300 billion worth that aren't already facing 25% taxes. The escalation covers everything from sneakers to toasters to billiard balls. The Chinese have retaliated by hiking tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. imports.\n\nIt's not been all bleak, though, with some traders, particularly in Europe, focusing on a potential U.S. decision to postpone tariffs on cars.\n\n\"It is remarkable how the stock markets have managed to hold their own rather well considering everything that's happened, from the escalation of U.S.-China trade war to renewed fears over global growth,\" said Fawad Razaqzada, a technical analyst at FOREX.com.\n\n\"When the market is able to absorb so much negativity, it is usually a sign of strength. So I wouldn't bet against the S&P hitting another record high in the coming days, even if we think the markets are overvalued at current levels.\"\n\nMarkets were bolstered Wednesday by reports that the White House plans to delay a decision about imposing tariffs on autos from Europe and elsewhere by up to six months. A decision was due by Saturday.\n\nCNBC, quoting unnamed sources, said that the administration was close to announcing a postponement of the auto tariffs for up to six months. The administration sees the threat of the auto tariffs as a way to gain leverage over trading partners such as the European Union and Japan in ongoing trade talks.\n\nSentiment was also buoyed by reassurances on trade from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin said he and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer were planning to travel to Beijing for more talks. Details of such negotiations have not been announced by the Chinese side.\n\nEarlier, in Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.6% to finish at 21,062.98. South Korea's Kospi dipped 1.2% at 2,067.69. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.7% to 6,327.80.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump's trade team probably would return to Beijing soon to continue negotiations. He said negotiators are also close to reaching a deal with Canada and Mexico that would lift steel and aluminum tariffs the administration imposed a year ago. And the president, several outlets reported, would delay for six months a decision on imposing import duties on foreign cars and parts, avoiding a move the auto industry has said would be crippling.\n\nInvestors took the developments as a sign that trade peace is primed to break out: Stocks rallied for the second day in a row.\n\nBut developments later in the day should dash that nascent optimism -- and provide a warning to anyone inclined to conclude the Trump administration wants to wind down its trade fights any time soon.\n\nTrump on Wednesday evening declared a national emergency, via an executive order, to protect American communications networks from espionage by foreign suppliers, a move directed at Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Then the Commerce Department effectively banned the sale of American tech to the company, my colleagues Ellen Nakashima and Josh Dawsey report.\n\nAnd rather than declare a temporary cease-fire on autos, Trump will give the European Union and Japan six months to agree to limit their imports into the United States, Bloomberg News's Jenny Leonard and Shawn Donnan report. \"According to the order, which people familiar with the matter say Trump is expected to sign this week, the administration has determined that imports of cars into the U.S. present a threat to national security because they have hurt domestic producers and their ability to invest in new technologies,\" they write.\n\nThe lesson for investors, business owners and everyone else with a stake in the outcome of the trade wars is clear enough: Although Trump may be focused for now on dialing up his confrontation with Beijing, he is still intent on forcing a reckoning with Europe and Japan.\n\nClose observers of Trump's handling of his trade agenda say his get-tough approach to erstwhile allies and strategic competitors alike should come as no surprise. \"Trump loves leverage. So he sees the auto tariffs as a leverage point with the E.U. and also with Japan, primarily for agriculture because the E.U. is refusing to include agriculture in the negotiations,\" says Stephen Myrow, managing partner of policy research firm Beacon Policy Advisors. \"The protectionism angle is going to be with us indefinitely as long as he's in office.\"\n\nIn a note this week, Chris Krueger of Cowen Research Group reached the same conclusion about Trump's attitude toward auto tariffs. \"There is a strong belief in the Administration that the only reason USMCA was signed and that the Chinese are negotiating is because tariffs were not only threatened, but imposed,\" he writes. \"The general idea is in order for Japan and EU negotiators to open up agricultural markets to U.S. farmers, auto (and auto parts) tariffs will be required.\"\n\nAnd even before Trump's executive order on autos, industry sources responded tepidly to the news of the tariff postponement. \"Manufactures and suppliers do best when there's certainty in the economic environment. And these continued negotiations, with the cloud of not having agreement on what we're negotiating, just extends the uncertainty,\" said Anne Wilson, a top lobbyist for the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association. \"This will lead to loss of jobs and loss of investment in the U.S.\"\n\nOr as the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers put it in a Wednesday statement, \"The case remains clear -- cars are not a national security threat. We are deeply concerned that the administration continues to consider imposing auto tariffs.\"\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\n-- Hope for USMCA: \"[Trump's] flailing domestic agenda received a spark of life on Wednesday, with top lawmakers in both parties expressing new hope that the president's North American trade pact could be ratified by Congress this year,\" Politico's Heather Caygle, Burgess Everett and Sabrina Rodriguez report. \"Key officials negotiating the deal with Mexico and Canada are working both sides of the Capitol in an effort to ease concerns not only over the provisions of the pact but Trump's ongoing tariff war with Mexico, Canada, Europe and China.\"\n\n-- Xi speaks, brushes back critiques of Chinese culture. Chinese President Xi Jinping repeated his rallying cry about his nation's culture on Wednesday, continuing his call \"on Asian countries to stand together with self-confidence and promote their culture as the world becomes 'multipolar,' my colleague Gerry Shih reports from Beijing. \"Wednesday's conference came weeks after a top State Department official drew heavy criticism from within U.S. policy circles and from China for remarks casting U.S. competition with China as a cultural and racial clash.\"\n\n-- Alibaba reports slower growth. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba \"appears to be feeling the effects of China's economic slowdown and the trade war with the United States,\" the New York Times's Raymond Zhong reports. \"[Alibaba] Group said on Wednesday that revenue increased by 51 percent in the March quarter from the same period last year. That topped Wall Street's expectations, and was a pickup from the quarter before.

(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nThe Trump administration took its most aggressive action to date Wednesday to bar Chinese companies from access to Americans' sensitive data and digital systems.\n\nThe president's executive order gave the Commerce Department sweeping authority to ban U.S. information and communications technology companies from doing business with any foreign company it deems a threat to national security, as my colleagues Ellen Nakashima and Josh Dawsey reported.\n\nAnd while the initial target seems to be Huawei -- the Chinese telecom giant that's among just a handful of global providers of next-generation 5G wireless technology -- the administration could swing much more broadly. Indeed, senior administration officials addressing the media declined to speak about Huawei directly and stressed the order could be applied to numerous companies.\n\nThe move comes as officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence community are decrying Chinese hacking as the most nettlesome challenge in cyberspace and as the U.S. government is working with industry on broad plans to block foreign threats to numerous industry sectors. That could include publishing lists of acceptable vendors.\n\nIt also comes as the Trump administration is engaged in a tit-for-tat trade dispute with China with both countries raising tariffs on the other's goods. Moves to restrict Chinese companies on national security grounds are sure to push a grand bargain on trade even further away.\n\nThe executive order was expected over a year ago, but it was blocked by the National Economic Council while trade negotiations were ongoing, Ellen and Josh reported. When those talks hit an impasse last week, the council dropped its objections, an official told them.\n\nThe Commerce Department also, on Wednesday, added Huawei and 70 of its affiliates to a list that requires government approval before it can buy components from U.S. companies, a move that will make it highly difficult for Huawei to sell some products, Reuters reported.\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, touted the executive order as a national security necessity with no mention of trade.\n\n\"The President has made it clear that this administration will do what it takes to keep America safe and prosperous, and to protect America from foreign adversaries who are actively and increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology infrastructure and services in the United States,\" press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.\n\nThe order -- which will take effect within 150 days -- may also help the administration's rocky efforts to encourage allies to bar Huawei from their nascent 5G networks, Ellen and Josh reported, but it will be an uphill climb.\n\nAdministration officials have been crossing the globe in recent months urging allies to block Huawei and even threatening to withhold some intelligence sharing if the Chinese company wins those nations' 5G contracts.\n\nThose pleas have had limited success in Europe, however, and even Canada appears poised to go its own way on Huawei.\n\nThe U.S. government's general position is that the Chinese government could force Huawei to steal secrets from U.S. companies or government agencies or to sabotage them during a broader conflict -- even if the company didn't want to.\n\nThe danger of sabotage will grow substantially with 5G, they say, because the super-fast networks will enable far more things to be connected to wireless Internet -- including advanced medical technology and driverless cars -- that could cause severe damage or even deaths if they were corrupted.\n\n\"This moves from a data confidentiality issue to a life-safety issue,\" Chris Krebs, director of the DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told senators during a Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday.\n\nHuawei officials, meanwhile, say they've never assisted Chinese spying and would refuse any request to do so -- from any nation.\n\nHuawei Chief Security Officer Andy Purdy told me on Tuesday -- before the executive order was issued -- the U.S. government's concerns can be addressed by rigorous testing. Purdy, who was a top DHS cybersecurity official during the George W. Bush administration, added that all telecoms offering 5G technology should undergo similar testing because even accidental vulnerabilities can be exploited by a nation's adversaries.\n\n\"We'd welcome the opportunity to talk to these folks, to talk about policy and to help them understand the nature of the risks,\" he said.\n\nPINGED: The Senate is unlikely to vote on any election security bills this Congress despite intelligence agencies' warnings that Russian hackers will probably try to undermine the 2020 election as they did in 2016, Senate Rules Committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said Wednesday.\n\nBlunt made the comments during a Rules Committee hearing, saying there's no point in his committee considering election security bills because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) won't allow a floor vote on them. That was in response to a question from Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).\n\nPolitico's Eric Geller recounted the exchange on Twitter:\n\nH.R. 1 was a catch-all Democratic House bill that mandated election security reforms as well as increased voter access and other progressive priorities.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) introduced an election security bill popular with Democrats this week that would mandate paper ballots, post-election audits and minimum cybersecurity standards for state and local election systems. A bipartisan election security bill with fewer mandates sponsored by Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) is expected later this month.\n\nPATCHED: The FBI has offered to brief 2020 presidential candidates on counterintelligence threats after a Russian hacking and disinformation

accuses Canadians of espionage as Huawei standoff intensifies ", "body": "By Gerry Shih Gerry Shih China Correspondent May 16 at 6:31 AM\n\nBEIJING -- China on Thursday formally leveled grave espionage charges against two detained Canadians, raising the prospect of harsh punishment for the men caught in a spiraling three-way feud over Trump administration's treatment of the technology company Huawei.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry confirmed that prosecutors charged Michael Kovrig with \"gathering state secrets and intelligence for overseas forces\" and Michael Spavor with \"stealing and providing state secrets to overseas forces.\" The men were charged \"recently,\" ministry spokesman Lu Kang said without giving more specific timing.\n\nAfter holding Kovrig and Spavor in an undisclosed locations since December, China's confirmation of the formal charges came just as the U.S. government all but banned American companies from doing business with Chinese tech giant Huawei, a move that could badly cripple a firm considered by China to be a national symbol of industrial prowess.\n\nIn the last six months, the timing of Chinese action against Canadian citizens has reinforced suspicions that Beijing is targeting a close American ally in retaliation for what China says is an unfair American effort to hobble Huawei and seize one of its executives -- a campaign that it says is aided and abetted by the Canadian government.\n\n\"Everything in China is done in accordance with law,\" Lu, the Chinese government spokesman, told reporters Thursday. \"We hope Canada will not interfere with, or comment casually on, other countries' lawful practices.\"\n\nCiting Huawei's threat to U.S. national security, the Commerce Department had announced hours earlier on Wednesday that it named Huawei to the so-called \"Entity List.\" The blacklist is known to some as a \"death penalty\" because global companies often struggle to survive once they are starved of doing business with American companies or sourcing American parts.\n\nThe U.S. move, which administration officials said were motivated in part by faltering trade discussions with China, was likely seen as deeply hostile by Chinese leaders and a stark reminder by Washington of China's dependence on the American supply chain. Chinese officials were alarmed and outraged in 2016 when the Commerce Department similarly put ZTE on the \"Entity List,\" which threatened to put that Chinese tech giant out of business practically overnight.\n\nLu on Thursday slammed the Trump administration's \"unilateral sanctions\" as an abuse of export control measures and said China would take steps to defend itself.\n\n\"When Chinese businesses are wrongfully treated, China has the right to take measures to safeguard our legitimate and lawful rights and interests,\" he said.\n\nCanada became entangled in the brewing U.S.-China showdown late last year.\n\nSpavor, a businessman based near the China-North Korea border, and Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat and geopolitics researcher, were first detained by Chinese state security on Dec. 10, a week after Canadian airport authorities detained senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at the behest of U.S. law enforcement.\n\nThe Huawei chief financial officer has since been undergoing extradition proceedings in Canadian court, which is deciding whether to send her to the United States to face bank fraud charges. China has urged Canadian authorities to release Meng and repeatedly issued implicit warnings that Canada would pay a steep human price if she were to be handed over.\n\n[Canada arrested Huawei's Meng for the United States. As China retaliates, it's on its own.]\n\nWeeks after Meng's arrest, China revisited a 15-year prison sentence for the Canadian Robert L. Schellenberg and raised his sentence to death for trafficking drugs. Last week, a Chinese court scheduled Schellenberg's appeal hearing to begin hours after Meng faced an extradition hearing of her own in Vancouver. After a Canadian court pushed back a decision in Meng's case, the Chinese court also announced it would delay announcing whether Schellenberg would be put to death.\n\nCanada has called on China to grant Schellenberg clemency and release Kovrig and Spavor. Meng's lawyers have argued that her constitutional rights were violated when she was interrogated for three hours at Vancouver's airport and should be released.\n\nKovrig and Spavor's arrest was first reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper on Thursday.\n\nSince December, Kovrig and Spavor have been kept in cells at undisclosed locations with lights on round-the-clock and without access to lawyers or family members, people familiar with the matter say. The two have been allowed short consular visits once a month, during which they are not allowed to discuss the cases against them with Canadian diplomats.\n\nThe men have told Canadian officials that they have not been physically mistreated aside from the extended sleep deprivation.\n\nA Canadian judge this month allowed Meng to move from a $4.2 million mansion into a bigger $10 million mansion -- she owns several homes in Canada -- due to security reasons.\n\nMeng must wear an ankle monitor as part of her bail terms but she is free to roam Vancouver between the hours of 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. while she awaits her next extradition hearing, scheduled for September.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8XyAOnmsjaltmvYDjbK7R6ueqgY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SOHLMDTXYUI6TPJFZGEVKXTXMY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4792077", "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 295699800}, {"uri": "1137373993", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-16", "time": "09:00:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-16T09:00:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/world/asia/china-canadian-arrested.html", "title": "China Charges 2 Canadians With Spying, Deepening a Political Standoff", "body": "BEIJING -- Two Canadian men detained in China since December have been formally arrested on espionage charges, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Thursday, in a move likely to ratchet up tensions between China and Canada that broke out with the arrest of a Chinese executive in Vancouver.\n\nMichael Kovrig, a former diplomat who was detained while visiting Beijing, was charged with \"gathering state secrets and intelligence for abroad,\" while Michael Spavor, a business consultant who was detained in northeast China, was accused of \"stealing and providing state secrets for abroad,\" Lu Kang, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, said at a regularly scheduled news briefing.\n\nThe vague reference to unspecified overseas entities left open the question of whether the men were suspected of working for a government or for some other organization.\n\nThe charges are likely to anger the government of Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who condemned the initial detentions of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor as \"arbitrary\" and politically motivated. Supporters of the two men and foreign legal experts have said that their detentions appeared to be retaliation for the arrest in Canada of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei, China's biggest telecommunications company, at the behest of the United States.\n\nMr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor were seized by the police in December, days after Ms. Meng was arrested while changing planes in Vancouver. The Chinese government was incensed by Ms. Meng's arrest, and the charging of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor makes it more likely that they will face trial and conviction, deepening the standoff with Mr. Trudeau's administration.\n\nMr. Lu did not provide further details and said only that the arrests were made recently.\n\n\"Everything in China is done in accordance with law,\" Mr. Lu said. Responding to a reporter's question about Canadian officials' criticism of how China handled the cases, he said: \"We hope Canada will not interfere with or comment casually on China's legal system and lawful practices.\"\n\nBefore the latest announcement, Chinese officials had already signaled that Mr. Kovrig and Spavor could be charged with espionage offenses.\n\nMr. Kovrig worked for the United Nations and the Canadian foreign service before 2017, when he joined the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization that tries to defuse conflicts between states. He focused on Chinese foreign policy, Asian regional politics and North Korea, and he was often quoted in foreign news outlets and invited to meetings in China.\n\nMr. Spavor followed a less conventional path, using his knowledge of the Korean language to establish himself as a consultant for companies and people interested in North Korea, including Dennis Rodman, the former basketball star who has befriended the North's leader, Kim Jong-un. Mr. Spavor was detained in Dandong, the Chinese city on the North Korean border where he was based.\n\nIn early March, a legal affairs committee within China's ruling Communist Party said investigators believed that Mr. Kovrig had been \"stealing and spying to obtain state secrets and intelligence,\" and that Mr. Spavor had supplied him with information.\n\nBut China's definition of state secrets can be sweeping and opaque, and the International Crisis Group has said Mr. Kovrig's work for it was in no way nefarious.\n\nSince they were detained, Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor have been held in secretive detention sites, without visits from lawyers and family members. Canadian diplomats have been allowed to visit them about once a month. Mr. Lu, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, did not respond to questions Thursday about where the two men were being held.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms. Meng has been granted bail as she fights potential extradition to the United States to face criminal charges. Her lawyers have said that they would sue Canadian border services, the police and the federal government for violating her constitutional rights when she was detained for three hours in December before being arrested.\n\nIn January, American prosecutors released an indictment of Ms. Meng and Huawei, laying out what they said were efforts by the company to steal commercial secrets, obstruct a criminal inquiry and engage in bank fraud while trying to evade American sanctions on Iran. Huawei has denied that it broke the law, and the Chinese government has repeatedly said that the charges were politically driven.\n\nThe Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, said at a news conference in early March that the case against Huawei and Ms. Meng was \"by no means a purely judicial case, but rather a deliberate political case\" intended to bring down Huawei. The United States has pressured allies not to use Huawei's technology, arguing that China could use it to spy on other countries.\n\nMr. Trudeau and Canadian and United States officials have said that the case against Ms. Meng is a legal matter, not a political one.

It singles out economic and industrial espionage as areas of particular concern.\n\n\"The President has made it clear that this Administration will do what it takes to keep America safe and prosperous, and to protect America from foreign adversaries who are actively and increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology infrastructure and services in the United States,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.\n\nThe order authorizes the commerce secretary to block transactions involving communications technologies built by firms controlled by a foreign adversary that puts U.S. security at \"unacceptable\" risk -- or poses a threat of espionage or sabotage to networks that underpin the day-to-day running of vital public services.\n\n[GOP senators raise alarms, criticize Trump as U.S.-China trade war heats up]\n\nWednesday's announcement was expected nearly a year ago, and comes as neither Washington nor Beijing appears willing to back down in their ongoing economic dispute. The National Economic Council, which had blocked the move for months, dropped its objection as trade talks hit an impasse, said one official.\n\nTrump's executive order does not immediately exclude any specific firms or countries, but certainly will not lessen tensions with Beijing. It is consistent with Trump's increasingly aggressive tack against China in which he has used tariffs as economic weapons, a tactic that he believes to be popular with his political base.\n\nThe move also boosts the administration's somewhat uphill effort to persuade allies and partners in Europe to bar Huawei, which officials say is beholden to the Chinese government, from their next-generation 5G wireless networks.\n\n[British government delivers scathing assessment of security risks posed by Huawei to U.K. telecom networks]\n\nThe order is not restricted to any one technology, such as 5G, but instead covers a swath of information communications technologies. That could invite a legal challenge from companies who believe it is overly broad, officials and analysts say.\n\nTrump declared the emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1977 law used by every president since Jimmy Carter to impose sanctions on countries such as Iran or Russia. It gives the president broad authority over economic activity.\n\nTrump's executive order instructs the commerce secretary to develop an enforcement regime and permits the secretary to name companies or technologies that could be barred, according to officials.\n\nShould that happen, said Paul Rosenzweig, a former homeland security official in the George W. Bush administration, the banned firm \"would assuredly sue.\" Rosenzweig, now a senior fellow with the R Street Institute, a policy group that advocates free markets, said that congressional action to bar a specific firm likely would have a better chance at withstanding legal scrutiny.\n\nThe order acknowledges that, although an open investment climate is generally positive, the United States needs to do more to protect the security of its networks. The idea is to have an \"in case of emergency, break glass\" authority, said one U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before it was released.\n\nAnd though the president already may veto proposed acquisitions of American companies by foreign buyers if he believes they endanger national security, the government lacks the authority to intervene in specific transactions deemed to pose such a risk.\n\n\"There are other levers we have, based more on contracting influence and power of the purse, but this would be more of an explicit exclusionary authority,\" said an official familiar with the matter.\n\n[U.S. officials planning for a future in which Huawei has a major share of 5G global networks]\n\nLast year Trump signed a law that barred the federal government and its contractors from doing business with Huawei and several other Chinese firms on national security grounds. And the country's four major telecom carriers have committed to the federal government that they will not use Huawei equipment in their networks.\n\nBut this order, once implemented, would establish a national policy applying to commercial entities outside the U.S. government and permits the commerce secretary to name the countries and organizations subject to the restrictions, as well as the technologies at issue. The order also would permit the secretary to direct the timing and manner of how U.S. firms would cease using such equipment, officials said.\n\nA number of rural carriers use Huawei in their networks as a lower-cost alternative to European firms such as Nokia and Ericsson. The Federal Communications Commission is preparing a rule that likely would restrict federal subsidies to carriers that use Huawei gear and the rural carriers have told the government that replacing Huawei is a cost they cannot afford.\n\nA number of European officials in recent months have expressed consternation that the United States is pressing them to block Huawei from their planned 5G networks while not having officially banned the firm. This order helps counter that objection, officials said.\n\nSecurity officials say the issue is one of national security, not trade. But the two inevitably have become linked as China's quest to dominate advanced technologies in the global market has prompted significant concerns about the potential for espionage or sabotage.\n\nTrump, unlike most previous presidents, has frequently relied on national security arguments in his bid to reshape U.S. trading relationships, demonstrating a willingness to stretch legal authorities beyond their customary bounds.\n\nLast year, for instance, he cited a little-used national security provision of a 1962 law to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. He also has ordered the Commerce Department to investigate doing the same on foreign-made automobiles and auto parts.\n\nThe national emergency declaration comes a day after a congressional hearing in which senators from both parties joined administration officials in calling out the risks of doing business with a company like Huawei.

The action has long been expected and is the latest salvo in the administration's economic and security battle with China. It is also the most extreme move in the Trump administration's fight against China's tech sector.\n\nLed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, American officials have warned allies for months that the United States would stop sharing intelligence if they use Huawei and other Chinese technology to build the core of their fifth-generation, or 5G, networks. The networks promise not only faster cellular service, but also the connection of billions of \"internet of things\" devices -- such as autonomous cars, security cameras and industrial equipment -- to a new internet architecture.\n\nPentagon and American intelligence officials have warned that Chinese firms will be able to control the networks and have expressed concerns not only that secure messages could be intercepted or secretly diverted to China, but that the Chinese authorities could order Huawei to shut down the networks during any conflict, disrupting American infrastructure as diverse as gas pipelines and cellphone networks.\n\nHuawei has denied those charges, and its chief executive has said he would shut down the company rather than obey Chinese government orders to intercept or divert internet traffic. American officials say he would have no choice: Chinese law requires that the country's firms obey instructions from the nation's Ministry of State Security.\n\nMr. Trump has been deeply involved, quietly meeting with American telecommunications executives at the White House and weighing different versions of the executive order. He has insisted that the United States must \"win\" at the 5G competition, only to be told that no American firms make the core switches that will direct 5G internet traffic.\n\nThe executive order came amid an escalating trade war between the United States and China, with the two sides imposing hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs in recent days. Mr. Trump has accused the Chinese government of unfair trade practices and announced increased tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods last week.\n\nBut few issues have gained as much bipartisan support in Washington as the Trump administration's warnings of the security threats posed by Huawei and ZTE, another company with deep links to the Chinese government. The calls have gotten so intense that some have warned of a new red scare, and Chinese officials have said the United States has moved beyond caution to paranoia.\n\nThe major mobile phone companies have renounced the use of Huawei equipment in their 5G systems, but the order will ensure that smaller, rural telecom companies avoid Huawei when they build new networks.\n\nBecause 5G systems feature high-speed, low-range equipment, the technology is more suited for now for urban areas than rural areas. But Huawei remains appealing to rural networks because it is cheaper than alternatives.\n\nThe ban could also help with the Trump administration's campaign to get European allies to block Huawei. Some allies had questioned why they should block Huawei if the United States had not. Other European officials have suspected that Mr. Trump will soften or eliminate the ban as part of a trade deal with China. Most major allies have resisted the Trump administration's push, except Australia, which banned Huawei last summer.\n\nThe White House, intelligence officials and lawmakers from both parties argue that China has already shaped its telecommunications and that tech industries have also given rise inside Chinese territory to facial recognition, constant surveillance of the population and human rights abuses.\n\nAmerican officials have also warned that China's exports of Huawei and other tech products have allowed other authoritarian nations to spy on their citizens and access sensitive security and trade secrets.\n\nBut even if Huawei is banned from the United States, it will likely control 40 to 60 percent of the networks around the world. It has made a strong marketing pitch in Africa, Latin America and parts of Asia where it holds huge economic influence. American officials have said China has offered subsidized prices and low-interest loans to outmaneuver the few Western competitors, chiefly Nokia and Ericsson, both European firms.\n\nThe United States will have to connect to those nations -- and must prepare for a day when the American government and companies will have to live in \"dirty networks,\" Sue Gordon, the deputy director of national intelligence, recently warned.\n\nIn January, prosecutors in Washington State charged two units of Huawei of conspiring to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile and of wire fraud.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he doubted that Chinese companies could meet American standards and laws on surveillance.\n\n\"There is no way in hell China can meet those criteria because of the way they're governed,\" Mr. Graham said at a hearing this week. \"The only way China can meet the criteria is to stop being China.\"\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission is considering regulations that would bar broadband providers that receive federal subsidies from using Huawei or ZTE equipment in their networks. The biggest American carriers have little equipment from the companies, but some rural telecom providers have expressed concern over how to rid their networks, which contain parts from various equipment makers, of Chinese products.\n\nThe commission recently approved an order that barred China Mobile Limited from providing service in the United States.

(Kin Cheung/AP) By Martin Lee May 15 at 4:39 PM\n\nMartin Lee is the founder of Hong Kong's Democratic Party.\n\nFor generations, Hong Kong has been a safe harbor from the chaos of Communist China.\n\nYet in January 2017, Chinese Canadian billionaire businessman Xiao Jianhua was abducted in Hong Kong from the Four Seasons Hotel by mainland agents, spirited off to China and not seen since. In 2015, five Hong Kong publishers vanished. One of them, Lam Wing-kee, recalled how he was kidnapped and forced to make a televised confession. \"I also want to tell the whole world,\" Lam said after escaping. \"This isn't about me, this isn't about a bookstore. This is about everyone.\" He was right.\n\nWhy were these people abducted? Because there is no extradition law between Hong Kong and China. There is no extradition law because there is no rule of law in China, where the Chinese Communist Party dictates who is innocent and who is guilty. For the same reason, the United States has no extradition arrangements with China (though it does with Hong Kong).\n\nThe Hong Kong government is poised to pass an extradition law that will legalize such kidnappings and threatens to destroy Hong Kong's free society. If the United States and other governments around the world don't act immediately to pressure Beijing and Hong Kong to withdraw the changes, the law could be rubber-stamped into effect as early as next week.\n\nThe law will allow Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who has shown no independence from Beijing, to transfer anyone at China's request. All that will be needed to set the process in motion is a simple affidavit that a \"crime\" of some kind has happened. Needless to say, this is a mockery of the rule of law.\n\nIn April, 130,000 Hong Kong citizens turned out in our city's narrow streets to oppose extradition to China. But public opinion can't stop this law.\n\nOver the past few years, Beijing disqualified six elected Hong Kong pro-democracy legislators by bogus means, and it now fully controls the legislature. Despite efforts by democratically elected legislators -- including unprecedented fisticuffs in the Legislative Council last Saturday -- the Hong Kong government has the votes to pass the extradition law quickly.\n\nThe United States has a special interest in blocking this law -- and indeed may be Beijing's special target of the law. There are about 85,000 U.S. citizens living or working in Hong Kong, which for decades has been their safe harbor for those operating in greater China -- teachers and preachers, as well as executives of 1,300 U.S. companies in Hong Kong, including financial services firms and technology giants such as Google.\n\nBeijing could extradite Americans in Hong Kong on trumped-up charges as a way to extract company trade secrets, software and other intellectual property. Americans either residing in Hong Kong or visiting Hong Kong could end up jailed in China.\n\nThe American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong strongly objected to the proposed extradition law, citing \"grave concerns\" about the absence of the rule of law in China. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a group that advises Congress, says the change in extradition law \"could pose significant risk to U.S. national security and economic interests in the territory,\" allowing \"Beijing to pressure the Hong Kong government to extradite U.S. citizens under false pretenses.\" The commission noted that U.S. Navy personnel could be at risk during routine port calls in Hong Kong's deep harbor.\n\nThe heart of this crisis is that Beijing views extradition as a political tool -- not as a legal matter. In the case of Canada's arrest of the chief financial officer of mainland telecommunications giant Huawei, Beijing objects to Canada extraditing the accused to the United States to face charges. Characteristically, the Chinese government is treating the case as a matter of international politics, not extradition law.\n\nThe Hong Kong government claims it is rushing through changes in extradition to close a so-called legal loophole -- but this supposed loophole has existed for more than two decades. The loophole is no threat to Hong Kong freedoms, whereas the proposed amendments to the extradition law certainly are.\n\nBy demanding this law, Beijing violates the spirit of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, with its \"one country, two systems\" pledge that Hong Kong would not be forced to adopt Communist laws and systems and could remain an international city safeguarded by the rule of law.\n\nHong Kong became a world-class city in part because of the trade that flows through our harbor. If this extradition law is passed, Americans, Canadians and many other nationalities could become potential hostages to extradition claims driven by the political agenda of Beijing.\n\nThe time for the world to act to protect Hong Kong's free society and legal system is now -- not when Hong Kong people and others are taken to be jailed in China.\n\nThe Post's View: Hong Kong's new extradition laws open the gates to Chinese repression\n\nThe Post's View: China's repression in Hong Kong is hurting its own cause\n\nThe Post's View: Hong Kong's rapid descent into repression", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/E6BItUDMsFKFwhfL8hHY1QVMvaA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BHKQ4EDUTEI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4786407", "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 295649520}, {"uri": "1136990700", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-15", "time": "20:52:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-15T20:52:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/15/trumps-multi-front-trade-war-wont-last/", "title": "Opinion | Trump's multi-front trade war won't last", "body": "A worker walks past shipping containers at the Yangshan Deepwater Port in Shanghai on May 10. (Qilai Shen/Bloomberg) By Henry Olsen Henry Olsen Columnist focusing on politics, populism, and American conservative thought Columnist May 15 at 4:25 PM\n\nChina's decision to hike its tariffs on U.S. imports has raised the stakes in President Trump's incipient trade war. To win, he's going to need help from a group he's already on rocky terms with: our allies.\n\nThe United States might be China's most important market, but it is far from its only one. The European Union is the second-biggest importer of Chinese goods after the United States, and China is its second-largest market for exports. Europe also ran a roughly $207 billion trade deficit with China in goods in 2018. U.S. markets and technology are important to China, but the E.U. could easily provide an alternative source of minds, money and markets for China if it does not support Trump's actions.\n\nOther U.S. allies face challenges. Australia, for example, is a huge net exporter of raw materials to China. Australia has not suffered a recession since 1991, and Chinese appetite for the gold and other minerals that lie beneath Australia's surface is a big reason why. Most economists expect that U.S. tariffs will cut China's economic growth, which in turn will reduce its demand for Australian imports. Trump's actions will affect our longtime ally as surely as they harm U.S. farmers.\n\nJapan and South Korea, two countries that along with Australia are the United States' strongest Asian allies, also have extensive trade ties with China. They are net exporters of capital goods, machinery and electronics, and chemicals to China. Again, any decrease in Chinese growth will reduce demand for these products, which in turn will harm their domestic economies.\n\nMost of these countries share U.S. concerns about Chinese growth in influence and military power, although Asian countries feel the effects more directly. Japan is increasing its own naval capacity to combat China's fast-growing navy, for example, and Australia banned Chinese companies such as Huawei as it develops its 5G network. They are not oblivious to the potential threat the communist government poses to their security, and they thus are inclined to back U.S. actions to restrain China's growth if it continues to act in irresponsible ways.\n\nBut almost all of these countries are also locked in their own trade battles with the United States, placing their cooperation in our fight with China in peril. Trump has also imposed or threatened to impose tariffs on goods from the E.U. and Japan. Those tariffs have pushed both Japan and the E.U. into trade talks with the United States, which are nowhere close to completion. Trump currently has to decide by May 18 whether he is going to impose more tariffs on automobile imports.\n\nThe fight with China is too large and too important for Trump to risk allied cooperation over U.S. trade disputes with our allies. European and Japanese competition may harm many U.S. industries, although as with all global trade, it also creates winners among U.S. firms and helps many consumers. More importantly, Japan and the E.U. do not pose a potential existential threat to the United States. Their militaries are small and rely on the United States for defense and intelligence. They are also free and democratic states and are not promoting an alternative social, political and economic system.\n\nChina will inevitably try to ratchet up the pressure on the United States if Trump holds firm. That will include more than just hurting U.S. farmers and exporters; it will include trying to woo U.S. allies with favorable deals to find alternatives to the United States. When that happens, Trump will need them to reject overtures that might be tempting and might be in those nation's and region's short-term interests. They will be much less likely to do that if they are embroiled in their own trade disputes with us.\n\nEven the United States is not large enough and powerful enough to fight the entire world at once. The global trading economy did not arise overnight, and it will not be reformed overnight. Chinese authoritarian expansion poses a unique and genuine national security threat to the United States and the entire free world. Trump should think strategically, make friends and strike favorable deals with our allies quickly in exchange for their cooperation in our battle with China.\n\nLawrence H.

But at What Cost?", "body": "SYDNEY, Australia -- In a recent online discussion, Bill Shorten, the front-runner in the race to be Australia's next prime minister, left little doubt about where he stood on the politically delicate issue of relations with China -- and where the world's other superpower fit into his calculus.\n\n\"If I'm P.M., I welcome the rise of China in the world,\" he said in a post on the Chinese social media platform WeChat that was aimed at Australia's 1.2 million voters of Chinese descent. Mr. Shorten, the leader of the center-left Labor Party, added that he saw China not as a \"strategic threat,\" but as a \"strategic opportunity.\"\n\nThose words put him directly at odds with the Trump administration, which has sounded alarms about China's global ambitions and tactics. But Mr. Shorten, while acknowledging that Australia would always be an ally of the United States, declared that it was time for his nation \"to stand on its own feet and think for itself.\"\n\nIf Mr. Shorten's party prevails in Saturday's election, his embrace of China would represent a significant break from the current conservative Australian government, which has taken a harder line toward Beijing's growing influence in the country and whose leader, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, is an avowed admirer of President Trump. It could also signify a crack in the united front that the Trump administration is trying to build to check China's ascent.\n\nFor Mr. Shorten, the calculation may be largely about economics. The Labor leader, whose campaign has promised significant spending to bolster public health programs, education and wages, is hoping that improved relations with China, Australia's biggest trading partner, will keep the economy growing.\n\nMr. Morrison, whose conservative coalition has narrowed the gap with Mr. Shorten's Labor Party in polls but is still trailing, has focused his election message on the notion that Labor's spending plans would send the economy into a recession. That is a frightening prospect to Australians who have known only economic expansion for a generation.\n\nBut critics fear that any softening toward China could have much broader ramifications, putting pressure on Australia, for instance, to roll back its clampdown on foreign interference or to keep silent on Chinese human rights abuses.\n\nMr. Morrison's warier stance on China was crystallized by remarks he made on Monday when asked about the protracted trade war between Washington and Beijing. He said that he would not pick sides, saying, \"You stand by your friends, and you stand by your customers as well.\"\n\nThe prime minister's branding of China as a \"customer\" drew derision from Mr. Shorten, who promised \"a bit more sophistication\" in handling ties between the countries. For decades, Australia's economy has been buoyed by the export of natural resources to China, as well as money from Chinese students, tourists and investors.\n\nIt's clear which leader Chinese officials prefer: Social media accounts on WeChat affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party have mocked Mr. Morrison and his government. One account disparaged \"a country whose head has been kicked hard by kangaroos\" and now wanted to be friends again after a rough patch.\n\nRegardless of who wins the election, Australia will continue to face profound questions over how it balances the economic necessity of cooperating with China with the imperative of protecting its national security interests. Australia is also grappling with its place in the Asia-Pacific region, and the world beyond, as China seeks to expand its economic and military power.\n\nThe relationship between the two countries has grown strained in recent years as the Australian government, heeding warnings from national security leaders, has pushed back against Beijing's attempts to expand its reach within the country's corporations, universities and national institutions, including Parliament.\n\nThe Australian government passed legislation cracking down on foreign interference and secret lobbying on behalf of foreign interests. It also banned the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from seeking a contract to install fifth-generation cellular networks in Australia, citing potential threats to national security.\n\nBeijing, in turn, has held up Australian coal and wine imports, and is believed to be behind a cyberattack that infiltrated the networks of the federal Parliament and the three main political parties. (China has dismissed the hacking allegations as a smear campaign.)\n\nChina has also bypassed the federal government by signing deals with individual Australian states as part of its gargantuan Belt and Road infrastructure initiative -- a global push that the United States and other critics say has lacked transparency and trapped partners in debt.\n\nWhile it is seen as unlikely that Mr. Shorten, who declined requests for an interview, would reverse the government's ban on Huawei, his party has indicated that it is open to signing on to the Belt and Road program.\n\n\"The fact that Australia is this ally that sits geographically parked in the Asia-Pacific does put it very much in the cross hairs of China's worldview, particularly on the idea of splintering and weakening the U.S. alliance system,\" said Euan Graham, the executive director of La Trobe Asia, a department of La Trobe University in Melbourne.\n\nThe Labor Party has traditionally promoted itself as more independent of American foreign policy compared with the conservative coalition, which under Prime Minister John Howard sent Australian troops into Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Shorten said that Mr. Trump's views on some issues were \"barking mad.\" When asked by a television audience this year how he would reconcile those comments should he meet with Mr. Trump as prime minister, Mr. Shorten said he would deal with Mr. Trump \"professionally and politely.\"\n\n\"But you ask, China or America? In Australia, we're smart enough to work with all of them to Australia's long-term interest if we behave in a smart and respectful fashion,\" Mr. Shorten told the audience.\n\nTwo recent cases involving public figures with ties to Australia may offer a glimpse of how Mr. Shorten would carry out that \"respectful\" approach.\n\nMr. Shorten has been reluctant to publicly criticize China over its detention of a Chinese-Australian novelist, Yang Hengjun, saying the case should not be handled through \"megaphone diplomacy.\" But in the case of Bahraini soccer player Hakeem al-Araibi, who had been granted asylum in Australia, Mr. Shorten's party directly contacted the authorities in Thailand, where Mr. al-Araibi was being held, to urge his release.\n\nIf China senses a friendlier stance from a Labor government, human rights is likely to be one of the areas where it would try to push first, said Giovanni Di Lieto, an international trade law expert at Monash University in Melbourne.\n\n\"That will be the real litmus test,\" he said.\n\nMr. Shorten is hoping to shift the debate on the proper approach toward China, which has largely been driven by a sharp divide between the country's business community and its national security establishment.\n\nConnections to China run deep in the Labor Party, and have been a sore point at times. One of Mr. Shorten's mentors, former Prime Minister Paul Keating, was until recently the chairman of the advisory board for the China Development Bank, which has poured nearly $200 billion into Belt and Road projects.\n\nAnd Bob Carr, a former Labor foreign minister, has essentially become one of the Chinese government's most effective spokesmen, and now heads a university institute dedicated to Chinese-Australian relations.\n\nWhile the governing coalition has had its share of China-connected scandals as well, the shadows have been especially hard for Labor to cast off.\n\nDuring one election campaign debate, a coalition government minister began reeling off the names of past Labor politicians who had taken on Chinese-funded roles after leaving politics.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_tarabay@nytimes.com", "name": "Jamie Tarabay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/world/15oz-shorten-1/15oz-shorten-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4785042", "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 295642980}, {"uri": "1136710759", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-15", "time": "14:11:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-15T14:11:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8235294222831726, "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hes-a-tough-man-trump-shrugs-off-concerns-about-hungarys-hard-right-leader-during-white-house-visit/2019/05/13/2fe20b5e-7592-11e9-b7ae-390de4259661_story.html", "title": "Trump Shrugs Off Concerns About Hungary's Hard-Right Leader During White House Visit", "body": "Coast Guard officer accused of plotting terrorist attack to remain jailed, judge says\n\nPresident Trump delighted Monday in welcoming Hungary's hard-right leader to the White House, an invitation the two most recent U.S. presidents -- one a Democrat and one a Republican -- had purposefully not extended.\n\nTrump's meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Orban was a thumb of the nose to his predecessors and the premise that foreign leaders who cavalierly reject concerns about human rights and free elections while flirting with U.S. rivals should not be afforded the coveted badge of respect that comes with an Oval Office visit.\n\nSeated beside Orban in the high-backed gold chairs he uses to receive foreign visitors, Trump said Orban has \"done a tremendous job in so many ways\" and has \"kept his country safe.\"\n\n\"Highly respected,\" Trump continued. \"Respected all over Europe. Probably like me a little bit controversial, but that's okay.\"\n\nTrump said the two would discuss trade and shared NATO concerns, but he did not publicly mention Hungary's slide into authoritarianism, its human rights and free speech abuses or growing anti-Semitism.\n\nA smile played around Orban's lips as he watched the chaotic scene of reporters jostling and shouting questions amid a phalanx of photographers angling for position.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Orban thanked Trump for the invitation and noted the two-decade interval since his last trip to see a U.S. president. He said he and Trump have \"similar approaches\" to many global issues.\n\n\"We are proud to stand together with the United States on fighting against illegal migration, on terrorism, and to protect and help the Christian communities all around the world,\" Orban said.\n\nTrump responded in kind.\n\n\"You have been great with respect to Christian communities,\" he said. \"You have really put a block up, and we appreciate that very much.\"\n\nIn office for nine years this time and once before for four, Orban has morphed from a crusading anti-Soviet reformer embraced by President Bill Clinton to an increasingly autocratic figure who has erected a fence along his country's southern border to keep out migrants and asylum seekers.\n\nThe Oval Office invitation is a coup for Orban, who has shrugged off his outcast status in Europe but is seeking a measure of rehabilitation ahead of elections to the European Parliament next month.\n\nThe Trump administration has largely shrugged off Orban's anti-democratic actions and said that the invitation is less an embrace of a like-minded figure and more about heading off Orban's drift toward U.S. competitors Russia and China.\n\nThe invitation was somewhat slow in coming, at least by Trump standards. Orban is the last Central European leader to get the nod, although he was the first foreign leader to endorse then-candidate Trump, in 2016.\n\nFormer Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon once admiringly said that Orban was \"Trump before Trump.\"\n\nOrban, 55, is the latest in a list of strongmen to get the one-on-one treatment at the White House. Other recent examples include the right-wing or autocratic leaders of Poland, Egypt, Brazil and Austria.\n\n\"It still remains rightly shocking to see Trump cozy up to authoritarian leaders,\" said Amanda Sloat, a former State Department official who is now at the Brookings Institution. \"The American president should be supporting democratic allies with shared values rather than autocrats who are actively undermining U.S. interests.\"\n\nTrump's ambassador to Hungary, New York financier and Trump friend David Cornstein, told The Atlantic recently that Trump \"would love to have the situation that Viktor Orban has, but he doesn't.\"\n\nA senior administration official told reporters Friday that Cornstein's remark may have been \"taken out of context\" but did not offer detail on what the ambassador meant.\n\nCornstein also told the magazine that he did not expect that Orban's targeting of an American university in Budapest founded by liberal Hungarian American donor George Soros would have much effect on U.S. relations with Hungary.\n\n\"I'm hopeful we can turn the page and move on to other subjects,\" he said.\n\nOrban has used familiar and veiled anti-Semitic references in attacking Soros as a \"crafty\" interloper who uses money to meddle in the country's affairs, and he has sought to link Soros with Muslim and other migrants Orban says would overrun the country.\n\nCountries that accept Syrian and other migrants are creating \"mixed-race nations\" and putting their history and traditions at risk, Orban said in a speech in February.\n\nHis political party was suspended from the right-wing People's Party, its perch in the European Parliament, over its anti-democratic actions.\n\nA bipartisan letter Friday from four members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee rued \"Hungary's downward democratic trajectory and the implications for U.S. interests in Central Europe.\"\n\nCommittee Chairman James E. Risch (R-Idaho), a Trump ally, was among the signers.\n\n\"We remain profoundly concerned about the close relationship between this NATO partner and Moscow,\" the letter said.\n\nBriefing reporters ahead of the visit, two Trump administration officials said the United States has put its concerns about the university, anti-Semitism and migration issues directly to Orban in other meetings, including lengthy discussions with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThe officials said the visit is part of a broader outreach to Central and Eastern Europe, rather than a personal reward for Orban.\n\nMain items on the agenda included U.S. concerns about European expansion of Chinese tech firm Huawei, European energy security and the potential for increased weapons sales to Hungary, the officials said.\n\n\"The point of this meeting is simply just to reinforce the strategic relationship between allies, NATO allies of U.S. and Hungary,\" one official said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the session, \"not necessarily just thrash out every issue on the bilateral agenda, which we have been doing constantly for the last two years.\"\n\nTrump didn't seem interested in thrashing out any contentious issues with Orban -- at least not publicly.\n\nToward the end of the Oval Office question-and-answer session, Trump was asked whether he is concerned about \"democratic backsliding\" in Hungary.\n\n\"Well, people have a lot of respect for this prime minister,\" Trump replied. \"He's a respected man. I know he's a tough man, but he's a respected man, and he's done the right thing, according to many people, on immigration.\"\n\nIn other settings, Trump has been harshly critical of more liberal immigration policies in Western Europe, especially in Germany and France.\n\n\"And you look at some of the problems that they have in Europe that are tremendous because they've done it a different way than the prime minister,\" Trump said Monday.\n\nTrump then invited Orban to say his piece.\n\n\"From the people, by the people, for the people,\" Orban replied, his tone clipped. \"This is the basis for the Hungarian government, so it's a government which is elected by the Hungarian people several times,\" Orban said. \"So we are happy to serve our nation.\"\n\nIndependent election monitors have found that Hungarian elections have become less free, and the Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe was critical of the Orban government's propaganda campaign during the most recent election in 2018.\n\n\"Fundamental rights and freedoms were respected overall, but exercised in an adverse climate,\" OSCE monitors wrote.\n\nTrump, wagging his index finger, closed off further discussion of Hungarian democracy by noting that the country is \"a very good member of NATO, and I don't think we can go into too much of a discussion unless that's mentioned.\"\n\nThis article was written by Anne Gearan from The Washington Post and was legally licensed through the NewsCred publisher network.

(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nTrump administration officials have warned for months that Huawei's global expansion into next-generation 5G wireless networks would amplify the threat of Chinese digital spying.\n\nBut now they're taking the gloves off, accusing the Chinese government of running roughshod over international norms and its own laws to steal Western innovations. The stepped up rhetoric comes as President Trump imposed high tariffs on a wide range of Chinese imports, leading to a major escalation in trade hostilities between the two countries.\n\nThe move to 5G makes concerns about spying and sabotage significantly more pressing because its super-fast speeds will allow far more systems critical to public safety to run on wireless internet connections, such as high-tech medical equipment and driverless cars.\n\nIf Huawei gains a foothold in U.S. allies' 5G networks, the Chinese government could force the company to send software updates to spy on Western companies or sabotage critical infrastructure, Chris Krebs, director of the Homeland Security Department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, warned lawmakers during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday.\n\nBeijing could also exploit hidden vulnerabilities that already exist in Huawei products to hack adversaries or it could plant spies inside Huawei teams that work abroad servicing the company's technology, Krebs said.\n\n\"It's not about overseeing Huawei. It's about overseeing China,\" Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (S.C.) said during the hearing.\n\nAdministration officials formerly attributed their concerns about Huawei to a 2017 cybersecurity law they said would force the company to cooperate with Chinese intelligence requests. But Krebs abandoned that nicety Tuesday.\n\n\"This is a single-party government. Everything that flows from the central party is a manifestation of their philosophy,\" he said. \"The [cybersecurity] law is important because it is telling you what they want to do. But they're going to get what they want anyway, law or not.\"\n\nThe U.S. and China stepped away from trade negotiations last week amid recriminations, and the heightened rhetoric on digital spying probably will make tensions worse.\n\nThe White House, which has struggled to convince allies to restrict Huawei from their 5G networks, may also impose its own ban on Huawei as soon as this week, Reuters reported Tuesday.\n\nLawmakers are also taking a cue from the administration and moving to restrict China from access to U.S. technological innovations.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a bill to bar exporting large categories of technologies to China including artificial intelligence, robotics, semiconductors and advanced construction equipment.\n\nHawley and five other Republicans also proposed another bill to bar Chinese students from science or engineering schools connected with the People's Liberation Army from receiving U.S. visas.\n\n\"This is a strategy with multiple tentacles,\" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said, describing Chinese digital spying efforts, \"and we as members of Congress need to understand every one of those and chop them off.\"\n\nHuawei officials, meanwhile, described the company as caught in a big power dispute between the United States and China in which the risk the company poses is being mischaracterized and misunderstood.\n\nHuawei's argues U.S. officials' concerns about back doors in Huawei products can be addressed with regular audits and risk assessments -- and that wireless carriers can vet any software updates to ensure they're similarly free of back doors, Huawei Chief Security Officer Andy Purdy told me.\n\nSimilar assessments should be done on any 5G technology vendor because even technology that is designed to be as secure as possible probably will contain some bugs that sophisticated hackers can exploit, said Purdy, who was a top DHS cybersecurity official during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nBut those arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears, Purdy said.\n\n\"We'd welcome the opportunity to talk to these folks,\" he said, \"to talk about policy and to help them understand the nature of the risks.\"\n\nPINGED: Exclusive to the Cybersecurity 202: Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) plans to reintroduce today an election security bill that mandates paper ballots and post-election audits and would grant DHS broad authority to set mandatory cybersecurity requirements for voting machines, voter registration databases and election results websites.\n\nIt's the first standalone Senate bill this Congress that would force major reforms to election security. It comes after Russian hackers probed numerous election systems in 2016 and penetrated a handful of voter registration databases.\n\nThe updated version of the Protecting American Votes and Elections Act, would authorize $500 million in grants to states to pay for new machines to count paper ballots. It would also authorize $250 million for ballot marking machines to be used by people with disabilities that can't use paper ballots.\n\nThe bill has already been endorsed by numerous election security advocacy groups including the National Election Defense Coalition and the Brennan Center for Justice as well as by Stacey Abrams, a Democrat who narrowly lost a race to be Georgia's governor in November. Georgia is considered a laggard on election security and was one of five states that lacked paper ballot record for all races in 2018.\n\nWyden's bill won numerous Democratic co-sponsors last Congress but didn't get any support from Republicans who are far warier about imposing specific election security requirements on states.\n\nThis version of the bill comes with a dozen Democratic co-sponsors, including presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Cory Booker (N.J.), Kirten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Kamala Harris (Calif.).\n\nPATCHED: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) confirmed after an FBI briefing Tuesday that Russian hackers gained access to voter registration databases in two Florida counties ahead of the 2016 election, the Associated Press's Brendan Farrington reported.\n\n\"DeSantis said the hackers didn't manipulate any data and the election results weren't compromised,\" Farrington reported. The governor was barred by the FBI from revealing the counties, but said officials there know about the breaches.\n\nThe news helps explain a portion of the Mueller report, which stated that FBI officials believed Russian hackers penetrated the networks of \"at least one\" Florida county before the 2016 election. It doesn't explain, however, why the FBI is only confirming the breaches now - or why they didn't alert Florida state government officials at the time.\n\nSen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who was governor at the time and has said he was unaware of the breaches, will get an FBI briefing today, the AP reported.\n\nSen Bill Nelson (D), who Scott defeated for reelection, previously said Russian hackers were active inside Florida networks before the 2018 contest - a claim that has not yet been born out.\n\nPWNED: Another bill introduced by four senators Tuesday would require that a DHS election security expert serve on an Election Assistance Commission panel that writes voluntary voting system security guidelines.\n\nThe EAC is drafting an updated version of those guidelines now in the leadup to the 2020 contest.\n\nThe Voting System Cybersecurity Act's sponsors are Sens. James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), co-sponsors of a broader bipartisan election security bill that they plan to reintroduce this month, and Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Gary Peters (D-Mich.), chair and ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee.\n\nAfter WhatsApp's disclosed that a sophisticated spyware agency had found a way to hack some of its users, it would be reasonable to conclude that no security system is perfect and that highly skilled hackers can find a way to breach almost any system given enough time and resources.\n\nAccording to WhatsApp, the group that exploited the hacking technology was likely a government and the victims were likely human rights groups, as Reuters reported.\n\nAn unreasonable conclusion, however, would be the one drawn by a Bloomberg Opinion writer - that consumer cybersecurity protections such as end-to-end encryption are pointless marketing gimmicks.\n\nInformation security Twitter was quick to swat back the overblown claim.\n\nHere's Georgetown University cryptography professor Matt Blaze:\n\nAnd here's a take from privacy lawyer and AccessNow U.S Policy Manger Amie Stepanovich:", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/a981ff36d4cd13cb1606d655a2337c77-3968-2645-70-8-7ZMTYYDV24I6TM7VKZZ634WRE4.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4786358", "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 295616400}, {"uri": "1135685289", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-14", "time": "11:43:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-14T11:43:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2019/05/14/the-cybersecurity-202-this-presidential-contender-wants-to-create-a-cabinet-level-cybersecurity-department/5cda19df1ad2e544f001dd08/", "title": "Analysis | The Cybersecurity 202: This presidential contender wants to create a Cabinet-level cybersecurity department", "body": "Former congressman John Delaney, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview. (Christopher Goodney/Bloomberg News)\n\nThe Democratic presidential field for 2020 hasn't talked much about cybersecurity, but one candidate wants to change that.\n\nJohn Delaney, a former House member from Maryland, has proposed creating a new Cabinet-level cybersecurity department if he's elected. And he wants other candidates to start talking more about an issue that roiled the 2016 presidential election when Russian hackers compromised Democratic databases in an effort to sink the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"I want the Democratic Party to talk more about the stuff that matters to most Americans, and I think things like digital privacy and cybersecurity matter to a lot of people,\" Delaney told me. \"People feel really vulnerable out there and their government doesn't do anything to help them.\"\n\nThe new cybersecurity department would be in charge of most of the civilian government's cybersecurity efforts, including helping state and local governments secure their election systems and working with the private sector, Delaney told me. In other cases, it would be responsible for helping other agencies ensure their data and computer networks are secure.\n\n\"When you're thinking about the main risks going forward, it's hard to think this isn't one of the top five risks and the fact that the president of the United States doesn't have someone sitting around the Cabinet table whose sole purpose is to defend us against those threats is an indefensible position,\" he said.\n\nDelaney isn't the only 2020 candidate who is making cybersecurity part of his pitch, but other Democrats in the race to challenge President Trump have focused more narrowly on securing elections after the Russian hacking operation and disinformation campaign spread on social media platforms like Facebook.\n\nAll of the 2016 Democrats have vowed not to use hacked materials in their campaigns -- with some caveats. And Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) have both made their push for legislation to require paper ballots or backups a talking point at campaign events.\n\nDelaney is polling in the low single digits in Iowa but hopes that proposing solutions to big problems can boost his standing with voters. His other major policy proposals include a national strategy for artificial intelligence and a Peace Corps-style initiative focused on combating climate change.\n\n\"I think what most Americans say is they want someone who's focused on where the world is going and has real solutions, which is what I'm trying to do,\" he said.\n\nDelaney's interest in cybersecurity was partly sparked by the 2015 Office of Personnel Management breach, which compromised the sensitive security clearance information of more than 20 million current and former federal government employees -- a large portion of them from his Maryland congressional district.\n\nHis proposal for a cybersecurity department could help prevent the next OPM breach, he said -- by making protecting government networks a higher priority and by placing someone in the Cabinet whose sole job is to ensure there is enough money and sufficient resources to guarantee that protection.\n\nThe idea of a cybersecurity department has been batted around for years and the leaders of the Senate Homeland Security Committee are mulling a similar idea this Congress. The idea also has plenty of critics, however, including Suzanne Spaulding, who formerly led the Homeland Security Department division that's the government's lead cybersecurity agency now.\n\nSpaulding argued in a December paper with national security scholar Mieke Eoyang that creating a cybersecurity department would be an unnecessary and confusing bureaucratic shuffle that wouldn't improve government's cybersecurity posture and might even make it worse.\n\nThey pointed to some simpler changes they say have significantly improved government's cybersecurity -- such as a new law allowing DHS to mandate that other agencies adopt cybersecurity protections. The paper, which came out before Delaney's proposal, was bluntly titled: \"Bad Idea: Creating a U.S. Department of Cybersecurity.\"\n\nDelaney brushed off those concerns, however, saying people in government \"don't like change\" and routinely \"defend the status quo.\"\n\n\"We can all agree this is a massive threat and it's growing,\" he said. \"The government ... and private sector would benefit immensely from a [Cabinet-level] agency focused on it.\"\n\nDuring a wide-ranging interview, Denaley expressed support for most Democratic positions on cybersecurity issues.\n\nHe's deeply concerned about the possibility of Kremlin hackers interfering in 2020, he said, and favors tying federal grants to state and local election offices to requirements they meet minimal cybersecurtiy requirements and use paper ballots.\n\nHe also supports Trump administration efforts to limit the Chinese telecom Huawei's role in building next-generation global 5G wireless networks out of concerns it could help Beijing spying efforts. And he considers Chinese state-sponsored theft of American companies' intellectual property far more dangerous than the trade deficit that prompted the president's push for heavy tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nDelaney also said he generally supports the Trump administration's efforts to cow the nation's digital adversaries by launching more offensive hacking operations -- but worries about Trump's hesitance to criticize Russia for its efforts to undermine the 2016 election.\n\n\"In general, they've discounted Russian interference in the election for all the obvious reasons and that has set a bad tone at the top for dealing with that threat,\" he said.\n\nPINGED: President Trump seemed to join the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates Monday in pledging not to use information that was hacked or provided by foreign adversaries to attack campaign rivals.\n\nBut the president also claimed that he never used hacked materials in 2016 -- which is not true -- seeming to undermine the pledge.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly spoke on the trail about information hacked from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign and even urged Russia -- which intelligence agencies say was behind the hacking operation -- to search out more dirt on his Democratic opponent.\n\nA reporter asked Trump about the Democratic pledge during a question-and-answer session with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Trump replied: \"Well, I never did use [it]. As you probably know, that's what the Mueller report was all about. They said, 'No collusion,'\" the Associated Press's Jill Colvin reported.\n\nHe then added: \"And I would certainly agree to that. I don't need it. All I need is the opponents that I'm looking at. I'm liking what I see.\"\n\nThe Mueller report focused on whether Trump campaign officials knowingly cooperated with Russian hacking and disinformation operations and whether the president obstructed justice -- not whether his campaign used hacked material.\n\nDemocratic candidates have all pledged not to use hacked material against opponents, but some have included caveats -- such as if the information has been vetted and reported by the media.\n\nPATCHED: Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) is pressing for more information from a voter registration software company whose systems may have been compromised by Russian hackers during in 2016, freelance reporter Kim Zetter reported for Politico.\n\nThat company, VR Systems, has consistently maintained it was never hacked, but both a 2017 indictment and the redacted version of the Mueller report describe Russian hackers installing malware on the networks of a company that fits VR's description, Zetter reported.\n\nIn a letter to the company, Wyden asks for evidence backing up VR's claim that it wasn't breached.\n\n\"The company told Politico that in 2017, after The Intercept published an NSA document that suggested it had been targeted by the Russian hackers, it engaged top security firm FireEye to conduct a forensic examination of its own systems and network,\" Zetter reported.\n\n\"Based on analysis by FireEye, there was never an intrusion in our EVID servers or network,\" Ben Martin, chief operating officer for VR Systems, told Politico. \"We disagree with the Special Counsel report because top cyber security experts, along with the Department of Homeland Security, have tested our network multiple times since 2016 and they found no indication of a breach or installation of malware on our company network.\"\n\nThe company \"declined to provide a copy of that report or an executive summary of the findings to Politico,\" Zetter reported.\n\nPWNED: A hacking tool that was likely created by the Israeli spyware firm NSO group compromised numerous WhatsApp users - without the users downloading any malware, the Associated Press's Frank Bajak and Raphael Satter reported.\n\nThe Financial Times attributed the spyware to NSO group and a WhatsApp official made a point of not refuting that attribution, Bajak and Satter reported.\n\n\"The malware was able to penetrate phones through missed calls alone via the app's voice calling function, the spokesman said. An unknown number of people -- an amount in the dozens at least would not be inaccurate -- were infected with the malware, which the company discovered in early May,\" Bajak and Satter reported.\n\nWhatsApp put out a patch that fixes the issue soon after they discovered it.\n\nMilitary attorneys prosecuting a Navy SEAL charged with killing an Islamic State prisoner in Iraq in 2017 \"installed tracking software in emails sent to defense lawyers and a reporter in an attempt to discover who was leaking information to the news media,\" the Associated Press's Brian Melley reported, citing lawyers who said they received the corrupted messages.\n\n\"The defense attorneys said the intrusion may have violated constitutional protections against illegal searches, guarantees of lawyer-client privilege and freedom of the press, and may constitute prosecutorial misconduct,\" Melley reported.\n\nDefense attorneys for the SEAL, Andrew Gallagher, are asking a judge to force prosecutors to reveal who authorized the surveillance operation, Melley reported.

(Andy Wong/AP) By Josh Rogin Josh Rogin Columnist covering foreign policy and national security Columnist May 14 at 6:00 AM\n\nLots of countries hire Washington lobbyists and lawyers, even adversaries, but China and its state-directed corporations are stepping up their campaign to buy up parts of the swamp. In Congress, there's an effort to stop that, especially when it comes to China hiring former top national security officials to use them against the United States.\n\nThe case of former Obama administration cybersecurity official Samir Jain has sparked a reaction from lawmakers who see his new gig as a lobbyist for Huawei as problematic. After the news broke last month that Jain, who served as National Security Council senior director for cybersecurity policy in the Obama White House, had registered as a Huawei lobbyist, President Trump tweeted: \"This is not good, or acceptable!\"\n\nBut the president didn't explain why Jain working for Huawei was bad. Lawmakers want to put new rules in place to restrict adversary countries -- like China -- from gaining access to sensitive U.S. national security information by hiring former officials.\n\n\"In recent years, the Chinese Communist Party has increasingly turned to the swamp to advance its hostile agenda,\" Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) told me. \"We must do all we can to prevent senior government officials from shopping their connections on behalf of foreign adversaries. ... There is a clear need for broader action.\"\n\nLast month, Gallagher introduced the Congressional and Executive Foreign Lobbying Ban Act, which would prohibit former members of Congress, retired senior military officers and former senior political appointees from lobbying for foreign governments. Gallagher wrote to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray last month to inquire about Jain's security clearance status, since he is now working for Huawei.\n\n\"Mr. Jain's seniority and intimate knowledge of U.S. cyber security policy are now in the service of a state-directed company that according to recent reports has received funding from the National Security Commission of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army, and Chinese intelligence services,\" he wrote. \"I am deeply concerned that his current employment may jeopardize American national security and undermine efforts by the United States to rally the international community against threats posed by Huawei.\"\n\nThe FBI declined to comment on the status of Jain's security clearances but pointed me to Wray's January news conference announcing the indictments of Huawei and its chief financial officer Wanzhou Meng on charges of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran and stealing U.S. technology secrets. Wray said giving information to Huawei risks giving it to the Chinese government.\n\n\"It is public record that under Chinese cybersecurity law, Chinese companies like Huawei are required to provide, essentially, access upon demand with little to no process to challenge that,\" Wray said. \"And so that's why it creates the national security implications we are concerned about.\"\n\nCongress responded to those concerns by restricting the U.S. military's use of Huawei equipment in last year's National Defense Authorization Act. Huawei responded by suing the U.S. government, using the U.S. federal court system. That's the case Huawei has now hired Jain to lobby on, according to public disclosure filings.\n\nJain's firm, Jones Day, has represented the Chinese Embassy in the past. According to the company's website, the law firm's close relationship with the Chinese government was established by former partner Herb Hansell and continued at least until Hansell's death in 2015. Jones Day and Jain declined to comment for this story.\n\nAs the Center for Responsive Politics reported, Jain's contract is just one part of a seven-figure Huawei lobbying and public relations campaign. Jones Day registered under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which requires less reporting and therefore provides less transparency than registering under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).\n\nTwo public relations firms that Huawei also hired, Racepoint Global and Burson Cohn and Wolfe (BCW), registered under FARA, which is required for anyone working principally on behalf of a foreign government or its agent. The question of Huawei's connections to the Chinese government is hotly debated, but the public relations firms decided to err on the safe side, saying Huawei hasn't provided proof of its independence.\n\nHuawei claims to be a private, independent, employee-owned corporation, but there's significant evidence that's not the case. A recent research paper sought to demystify Huawei's opaque ownership structure. Regardless, the U.S. intelligence community believes Huawei is at the very least beholden to the direction of China's national security state and at worst an arm of it.\n\nThe reason Chinese companies such as Huawei need more oversight and restriction is because they present a broader threat to U.S. economic and national security than companies from other countries. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission released a new report last week detailing how Chinese companies facilitate the transfer of sensitive technologies from U.S. firms through legal and illegal means.\n\n\"Although Chinese companies are not the only foreign firms seeking to acquire U.S. technology, the Chinese case is unique because the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has prioritized technology transfer as a matter of policy and provides direct and indirect support to companies engaging in these anticompetitive activities,\" the report states.\n\nLaws must evolve to match evolving threats.

Sign up for the Today's WorldView newsletter.\n\n(Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nEven by Trump administration standards, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is a controversial White House guest. He is widely regarded as an autocrat in Europe; presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama had pointedly avoided hosting him.\n\nBut it's Trump's Washington now. And with the Dow Jones industrial average tanking on Monday by more than 600 points amid a fresh round of tit-for-tat tariffs in the U.S.-China trade war, the president welcomed Orban to the White House -- perhaps less worried about his illiberal policies and more about finding an ally in the battle against Beijing.\n\nKen Weinstein, president of the conservative Hudson Institute think tank, suggested to Politico that China was the most pressing reason for Orban's visit, saying the subtext of the trip was \"likely China, on Orb\u00e1n's relations with the Chinese and trying to get greater cooperation on this issue.\"\n\nYet despite some signs of personal affinity, Orban is likely to disappoint Trump on China. Under his leadership, Hungary has grown close to Beijing in recent years, part of a turn away from the West that has also seen the nation build ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Orban opened up the country to telecom giant Huawei Technologies and was the first European Union leader to express support for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Chinese President Xi Jinping's massive international infrastructure investment that is frequently criticized in Washington.\n\nJust last month, Orban visited Beijing, where Chinese state media reported that he said BRI was \"an opportunity rather than a threat.\"\n\nShouldn't Orban be lining up with Trump on China? Hungary is a NATO ally, and the tough-talking prime minister was an early supporter of Trump's presidential campaign. He has aligned with Trump on a host of controversial international issues, including immigration and religion.\n\nMeanwhile, China's unfair trade policies, egregious human rights abuses and worrying geopolitical ambitions pose a problem for countries all over the world. The United States is also the larger economic power, and most experts say Washington can inflict far more pain on the Chinese economy than Beijing can deal to the U.S. economy in retaliation.\n\nBut instead, Orban looks like he is sitting on the fence.\n\nThe truth is, Hungary is far from the only U.S. ally to try to avoid picking sides in the trade war. And it's not too hard to see why when you consider how much other countries have to lose. Americans are worried about this week's stock market tumble, but that outlook is far worse for countries that aren't an economic behemoth like the United States.\n\nSome nations are particularly hesitant to move away from the Chinese economic links they've established in the last few years. Huawei, the telecommunications firm at the center of American anxiety about Chinese influence in Hungary, is an excellent case in point.\n\nWashington may warn of security risks, but low-cost technology from Huawei is already in place for numerous U.S. allies; removing it ahead of upgrades to 5G networks would be prohibitively expensive for many countries, and the United States would do little to make up for the cost.\n\nThere is some serious collateral damage from Trump's tariffs, too. Some targeting Beijing, such as those on steel and aluminum imports based on \"national security,\" have also significantly hit U.S. allies. Rather than rallying potential allies to the China fight, Trump's unilateral trade actions are punishing them, too.\n\nIf the trade war intensifies, they might end up stuck between Washington and Beijing. Canada already found that out the hard way after it arrested Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on an American warrant in December. The impact wasn't just financial: Two Canadian citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, have been detained in China since the end of last year on deeply dubious charges.\n\nThe Trump administration loves to talk tough on trade and foreign policy. Over-the-top, arguably xenophobic language against China by Trump allies and surrogates may have pushed some allies away, especially as the administration veers close to conflict in Iran, Venezuela and North Korea.\n\nBut it's not just the Trump administration's hawkish leanings that may worry allies. It's also its unpredictably dovish ones. Only a week ago, most of the world expected Trump, a lover of signing deals, to accept a watered-down agreement from China. Now the trade war is back and bigger than ever.\n\nTrump's apparent U-turn seems to have been motivated largely by China's slow-rolling of negotiations. But some pundits also believe that Trump is positioning himself for the 2020 presidential election, when he believes that China could become a major issue in the battle against a Democratic challenger. Could Trump back down again, should the economy take a harder hit or the political calculation change in another way?\n\nIn that scenario, Beijing's relations with Washington might improve, but its smaller allies might remain exposed (see here: Canada). Even if Trump keeps a hard line on China, he might fail to win a second term. It is unclear who would replace him and what their China policy might be.\n\nThis unpredictability may help in hard bilateral negotiations, but it doesn't exactly foster alliances. Given the circumstances, it's not surprising that weaker allies are staying out of the fray. Writing from Australia over the weekend, the New York Times's Neil Irwin noted that the \"bifurcating world trade system has created new urgency in trying to keep options on both sides.\"\n\nFor a small country like Hungary -- \"fragile and threatened\" due to its size, as Orban puts it -- the best option may be to not pick sides, but to wait and see what he can extract from both parties in a bidding war. This week, he got a White House meeting with Trump ahead of upcoming European Parliament elections. Not too shabby.\n\nOf course, this Hungary first policy is at odds with U.S. interests, but who can blame Orban? Even Trump himself probably appreciates the chutzpah. The Hungarian prime minister is\"probably, like me, a little bit controversial,\" Trump told reporters in the White House on Monday. \"But that's okay.\"\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

Probably like me a little bit controversial, but that's okay.\"\n\nTrump said the two would discuss trade and shared NATO concerns, but he did not publicly mention Hungary's slide into authoritarianism, its human rights and free speech abuses or growing anti-Semitism.\n\nA smile played around Orban's lips as he watched the chaotic scene of reporters jostling and shouting questions amid a phalanx of photographers angling for position.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Orban thanked Trump for the invitation and noted the two-decade interval since his last trip to see a U.S. president. He said he and Trump have \"similar approaches\" to many global issues.\n\n\"We are proud to stand together with the United States on fighting against illegal migration, on terrorism, and to protect and help the Christian communities all around the world,\" Orban said.\n\nTrump responded in kind.\n\n\"You have been great with respect to Christian communities,\" he said. \"You have really put a block up, and we appreciate that very much.\"\n\nIn office for nine years this time and once before for four, Orban has morphed from a crusading anti-Soviet reformer embraced by President Bill Clinton to an increasingly autocratic figure who has erected a fence along his country's southern border to keep out migrants and asylum seekers.\n\nThe Oval Office invitation is a coup for Orban, who has shrugged off his outcast status in Europe but is seeking a measure of rehabilitation ahead of elections to the European Parliament next month.\n\nThe Trump administration has largely shrugged off Orban's anti-democratic actions and said that the invitation is less an embrace of a like-minded figure and more about heading off Orban's drift toward U.S. competitors Russia and China.\n\nThe invitation was somewhat slow in coming, at least by Trump standards. Orban is the last Central European leader to get the nod, although he was the first foreign leader to endorse then-candidate Trump, in 2016.\n\nFormer Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon once admiringly said that Orban was \"Trump before Trump.\"\n\nOrban, 55, is the latest in a list of strongmen to get the one-on-one treatment at the White House. Other recent examples include the right-wing or autocratic leaders of Poland, Egypt, Brazil and Austria.\n\n\"It still remains rightly shocking to see Trump cozy up to authoritarian leaders,\" said Amanda Sloat, a former State Department official who is now at the Brookings Institution. \"The American president should be supporting democratic allies with shared values rather than autocrats who are actively undermining U.S. interests.\"\n\n[Hungary evicts prestigious US-Hungarian university founded by George Soros]\n\nTrump's ambassador to Hungary, New York financier and Trump friend David Cornstein, told The Atlantic recently that Trump \"would love to have the situation that Viktor Orban has, but he doesn't.\"\n\nA senior administration official told reporters Friday that Cornstein's remark may have been \"taken out of context\" but did not offer detail on what the ambassador meant.\n\nCornstein also told the magazine that he did not expect that Orban's targeting of an American university in Budapest founded by liberal Hungarian American donor George Soros would have much effect on U.S. relations with Hungary.\n\n\"I'm hopeful we can turn the page and move on to other subjects,\" he said.\n\nOrban has used familiar and veiled anti-Semitic references in attacking Soros as a \"crafty\" interloper who uses money to meddle in the country's affairs, and he has sought to link Soros with Muslim and other migrants Orban says would overrun the country.\n\nCountries that accept Syrian and other migrants are creating \"mixed-race nations\" and putting their history and traditions at risk, Orban said in a speech in February.\n\nHis political party was suspended from the right-wing People's Party, its perch in the European Parliament, over its anti-democratic actions.\n\nA bipartisan letter Friday from four members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee rued \"Hungary's downward democratic trajectory and the implications for U.S. interests in Central Europe.\"\n\nCommittee Chairman James E. Risch (R-Idaho), a Trump ally, was among the signers.\n\n\"We remain profoundly concerned about the close relationship between this NATO partner and Moscow,\" the letter said.\n\nBriefing reporters ahead of the visit, two Trump administration officials said the United States has put its concerns about the university, anti-Semitism and migration issues directly to Orban in other meetings, including lengthy discussions with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThe officials said the visit is part of a broader outreach to Central and Eastern Europe, rather than a personal reward for Orban.\n\nMain items on the agenda included U.S. concerns about European expansion of Chinese tech firm Huawei, European energy security and the potential for increased weapons sales to Hungary, the officials said.\n\n\"The point of this meeting is simply just to reinforce the strategic relationship between allies, NATO allies of U.S. and Hungary,\" one official said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the session, \"not necessarily just thrash out every issue on the bilateral agenda, which we have been doing constantly for the last two years.\"\n\nTrump didn't seem interested in thrashing out any contentious issues with Orban -- at least not publicly.\n\nToward the end of the Oval Office question-and-answer session, Trump was asked whether he is concerned about \"democratic backsliding\" in Hungary.\n\n\"Well, people have a lot of respect for this prime minister,\" Trump replied. \"He's a respected man. I know he's a tough man, but he's a respected man, and he's done the right thing, according to many people, on immigration.\"\n\nIn other settings, Trump has been harshly critical of more liberal immigration policies in Western Europe, especially in Germany and France.\n\n\"And you look at some of the problems that they have in Europe that are tremendous because they've done it a different way than the prime minister,\" Trump said Monday.\n\nTrump then invited Orban to say his piece.\n\n\"From the people, by the people, for the people,\" Orban replied, his tone clipped. \"This is the basis for the Hungarian government, so it's a government which is elected by the Hungarian people several times,\" Orban said. \"So we are happy to serve our nation.\"\n\nIndependent election monitors have found that Hungarian elections have become less free, and the Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe was critical of the Orban government's propaganda campaign during the most recent election in 2018.\n\n\"Fundamental rights and freedoms were respected overall, but exercised in an adverse climate,\" OSCE monitors wrote.\n\nTrump, wagging his index finger, closed off further discussion of Hungarian democracy by noting that the country is \"a very good member of NATO, and I don't think we can go into too much of a discussion unless that's mentioned.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WKzscLFKhJun2VjpZX7E1AtZ2tM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DL6KAITVWEI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4784047", "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 295489380}, {"uri": "1135284262", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-14", "time": "00:13:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-14T00:13:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/05/13/us/politics/ap-us-united-states-hungary.html", "title": "Trump Meets Hungary's Far-Right Prime Minister", "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has never shied away from rubbing shoulders with leaders more typically kept at a distance by the West, and his Oval Office meeting Monday with Hungary's far right-leaning prime minister was only the latest example of his engagement with strongmen.\n\nLike Trump, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has espoused hard-line anti-migration rhetoric. The president described his guest this way: \"Probably, like me, a little bit controversial, but that's OK. That's OK. You've done a good job and you've kept your country safe.\"\n\nTrump's presidency has been marked by decisions that strain longtime U.S. alliances. He has refused to be confined to engaging only with traditional power players in the West. Orban has been accused of dismantling democratic institutions in his country.\n\nA top Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, called the meeting with Orban \"a betrayal to American values abroad\" and said Trump \"clearly has a dangerous affinity for authoritarian figures over our democratic allies.\"\n\nOrban was the latest central European leader to get a meeting with Trump, who wants to curry their favor and discourage them from moving closer to China and Russia.\n\nOrban said he was proud to stand with Trump in the \"fight against illegal migration, on terrorism and protecting the Christian communities all around the world.\"\n\nAsked about democratic backsliding in Hungary, Trump called Orban \"a tough man,\" but added that he's \"a respected man,\" too.\n\n\"He's done the right thing, according to many people on immigration,\" Trump said. \"You look at some of the problems they have in Europe that are tremendous, because they've done it in a different way than the prime minister.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch and Human Rights First both said, however, that Orban has not only assaulted the rule of law and basic human rights in Hungary, but has \"employed anti-migrant, anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic and xenophobic rhetoric while targeting civil society organizations and universities receiving funding from overseas.\"\n\nThe White House said the two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to NATO and democratic systems of government. They also discussed how best to increase vigilance against unchecked global migration and to address China's unfair trade and investment practices.\n\nOrban's was the first visit of a Hungarian prime minister to the Oval Office since 2005.\n\nOrban faced years of harsh criticism from the Obama administration over his weakening of democratic checks and balances. U.S.-Hungary relations have improved in recent months, partly because of Hungarian plans to purchase medium-range missiles from U.S. sources to improve the country's air defense system.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, has warned Hungary that \"an authoritarian Russia will never be a friend to the freedom and sovereignty of smaller nations.\" Pompeo also has emphasized the risks of doing business with Chinese telecommunications company Huawei, which has significant operations in Hungary, and said there are dangers to allowing \"China to gain a bridgehead in Hungary.\"\n\nThe Republican chairman and the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee wrote Trump a letter Friday, saying that \"democracy in Hungary has significantly eroded.\" Sens. James Risch, R-Idaho, and Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said that under Orban, elections have become less competitive, the judiciary is increasingly controlled by the state and press freedom has declined.\n\nThe letter, also signed by Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., complained that Hungary has failed to diversify its energy resources away from Russia and has allowed Moscow to exploit its visa system to evade U.S. sanctions. Late last year, the State Department said Hungary denied a U.S. request to extradite two suspected Russian arms dealers and sent the men to Russia instead.\n\n\"I hope that in the private conversation Trump will tell him that we don't like Orban sliding into the Russian sphere of influence,\" said Andras Simonyi, a former Hungarian ambassador to the U.S. who is now affiliated with George Washington University in Washington. \"I am not sure he will, but if he does, the visit was totally worth it. Otherwise it was a waste of the president's time.\"\n\nOrban is not the only hard-liner Trump has engaged with.\n\nTrump didn't hesitate to meet -- twice now -- with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in an effort to persuade him to give up his nuclear weapons program.\n\nHe has praised Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, which interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump also remains allied with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is under pressure over the killing of a Saudi activist who lived in the United States and wrote articles criticizing the kingdom.\n\nIn 2017, Trump met in Manila with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has attacked U.S. security policies and launched a crackdown on illegal drugs that has claimed the lives of thousands of mostly poor drug suspects. Duterte has sought Chinese infrastructure funding, trade and investment, has reached out to Russia and has threatened to end the presence of U.S. counterterrorism forces in the country, although that has not happened.\n\nAlso in 2017, during Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit with Trump in Washington, Erdogan's bodyguards attacked peaceful protesters gathered outside the Turkish ambassador's residence. Security officers guarding the authoritarian leader of Turkey, a member of NATO, hit and kicked the demonstrators, who wound up with injuries including concussions, broken and loose teeth, and a popped blood vessel in the eye.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Barbara Ortutay in San Francisco contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@nytimes.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "eventUri": "eng-4784047", "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 295488780}, {"uri": "1134363637", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-12", "time": "21:10:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-12T21:10:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/12/senate-has-important-work-do-why-waste-time-subpoenaing-donald-trump-jr/", "title": "Opinion | The Senate has important work to do.

(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) By Hugh Hewitt Hugh Hewitt May 12 at 4:52 PM\n\nThere are six vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals, with two more vacancies certain to occur and many more likely to happen before January 2021 as older members of the courts eager to be replaced by center-right judges take \"senior status.\" Each is nearly as important to preserving liberty, individual rights and the rule of law as a Supreme Court vacancy, though many outside the legal community don't understand this.\n\nThere are 48 nominees for district-court positions awaiting action by the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Senate as a whole. Another 12 nominees are waiting offstage. Increasingly, judges at this level of the judiciary are claiming the right to dictate national policy by way of injunctions binding the entire country, rather than only the district to which they were appointed.\n\nMost pressing are the vacancies on the often-overruled U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, and the 2nd Circuit has two vacancies that, when nominees are selected and confirmed, will flip that circuit's composition to a majority of Republican presidents' nominees.\n\nIt is a measure of President Trump's disdain for the long-rumored assault on his companies or family from the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York that he allowed the process of filling other vacancies on the 2nd Circuit to drag on for months, decisive as that court might be for appeals for politicized rulings against his interests. A fair conclusion is that the president doesn't think he's in legal peril. He never believed it about what he called \"the Russia hoax,\" and if he believed he was vulnerable in a jurisdiction answering to the 2nd Circuit, he would have put a spark under his judge-picking team long ago. But his confidence ought not to delay filling the vacancies.\n\nThese judicial nominees are the Senate's most important task, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) have patiently and persistently worked to address the backlog and change rules to allow the federal bench to be as populated as quickly as the White House allows, given the glacial pace of new nominees.\n\nThe Senate has other urgent business. The Finance Committee is about to take up crucial retirement-savings reforms that could impact tens of millions of Americans annually. That effort could creatively address the housing needs of seniors by allowing them to use tax-sheltered savings to pay off mortgages or secure senior living arrangements without triggering taxable events. That same committee and others have work to do on the soaring costs of some prescription drugs and on infrastructure, as well as the annual battle to adequately fund the military. The Senate Intelligence Committee must work with the executive branch to persuasively educate our allies -- Britain, primarily -- and the American public on the threats that Chinese telecommunications giants Huawei and ZTE pose to security global networks.\n\nYet that committee, charged with oversight of the intelligence community and thus with countless urgent issues and tasks, deemed it necessary to subpoena Donald Trump Jr. as a sort of final ritual in the opera of collusion delusion that has gripped the country since the 2016 presidential election. We need to know if this latest subpoena is simply a flexing of muscles by staff frustrated by years of fruitless digging that was rendered obviously irrelevant by the work of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and his conclusion that no conspiracy occurred between Russia and Donald Trump, his family or his campaign team.\n\nThe subpoena is a maddening coda especially for those who urged that the administration cooperate with the special counsel and that Mueller not be fired or in any way impeded. (Mueller wasn't. In fact, all the dense blocks of innuendo-filled prose in Part II of the Mueller report could not obscure that the president cooperated to an unparalleled degree with the special counsel.)\n\nWith all this real work to be done and military and national security matters to be superintended, Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and a majority of his committee colleagues still felt that one more whack at Donald Trump Jr. was necessary.\n\nIt isn't. No matter what the committee tells itself. Outside of #resistance cable television pundits and Bizarro Twitter, \"no collusion/no obstruction\" is the verdict that was rendered by the attorney general and accepted by the public, a verdict that the Senate GOP especially should know it ignores at the peril of its majority in 2021.\n\nHarry Litman: Trump Jr. is going by the family playbook.

May 12 at 8:50 AM\n\nPresident Trump ran for office vowing to extricate the United States from entanglements abroad. But his administration now finds itself juggling three national security crises overseas -- with Iran, Venezuela and North Korea -- while confronting China over a possible trade war.\n\nThe situation, partly a function of uncontrollable events, is also the result of Trump's \"go big or go home\" approach to foreign affairs, which has led his administration to apply \"maximum pressure\" to multiple nations simultaneously, rather than prioritize one over the other or take incremental steps.\n\nThe maximalist tactics at times have raised the prospect of big breakthroughs, ones that Trump hopes to take to the campaign trail for his reelection, particularly when it comes to North Korea.\n\nAt the same time, it has brought what former policymakers describe as a greater risk of crises and miscalculations, as well as possible distractions from the primary goal of the administration's national security strategy: countering Russia and China.\n\n\"The president's apparent tendency to brinkmanship brings with it a degree of danger -- and it's even more dangerous when it's combined with a pattern of bluffing,\" said James Dobbins, a former top diplomat who is now a senior fellow at the Rand Corporation.\n\nWhether Trump is willing to pursue military action, which he and his aides have referenced in public remarks, is a looming question. He has long been a vocal skeptic of American military force abroad and at times has expressed concern about the more hawkish impulses of his national security adviser, John Bolton. Strategy experts cite the risk of overextending U.S. rhetoric in conflicts with possible military outcomes if the president isn't willing to back words with actions.\n\n\"It's kind of like the not terribly capable bully, who likes pushing people around and teasing them, but when push comes to shove, is nervous to actually get into a bar fight,\" said Mara Karlin, a former Pentagon strategist during the Obama administration and a professor at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nTrump administration officials dispute that the president is engaging in any reckless brinkmanship. They point out that Trump and his top advisers primarily voice Washington's desire for peaceful resolutions to the confrontations in North Korea, Iran and Venezuela, and note that he has reinvigorated the diplomatic track with Pyongyang, brokering the suspension of menacing intercontinental ballistic missile tests. This past week, Trump extended an olive branch to Iran, \"saying I'd like to see them call me,\" even as his top aides lambasted the country and the U.S. military said it would respond to any attack on American interests with unrelenting force.\n\n\"The administration continues to leverage diplomacy, pursue economic pressure, and enforce existing laws to deter malign actors seeking to threaten stability and security,\" a senior administration official said in a statement. \"The United States, though, remains prepared to respond to any threats against America or our allies.\"\n\nThe official defended the efficacy and rationale of the administration's approach. \"The United States is responding to legitimate threats against America and our allies and partners with highly effective maximum pressure campaigns,\" the official said.\n\nThe possibility that Trump's resolve could be tested has increased in recent days.\n\nIn Asia, progress in talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un showed signs of backsliding, as the United States seized a North Korean vessel allegedly used for evading sanctions and suspended efforts to recover remains of American military personnel killed during the Korean War. Pyongyang, for its part, carried out new short-range missile tests, raising the possibility of a return to intercontinental ballistic missile testing it suspended after talks with Trump.\n\nIn South America, top administration officials suggested the possibility of military action against Venezuela after a failed insurrection by the U.S.-backed opposition took officials in Washington off guard. The U.S. military sent a hospital ship to the nation's coast in between preparing for contingencies should Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government fall.\n\nPerhaps the most concerning developments arose out of the Middle East. A year after Trump pulled out of the Iranian nuclear accord, Tehran announced that it would stop complying with some elements of the agreement, promising to enrich uranium to a higher level than allowed under the treaty. The decision once again raising the threat of nuclear proliferation in one of the most unstable parts of the world.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon dispatched a carrier strike group, a bomber force and a Patriot missile battery to the Middle East after receiving intelligence suggesting that Iran could be preparing an attack against U.S. troops or interests in the region.\n\nAs the crises with North Korea, Venezuela and Iran unfold, one risk is that the Trump administration will lose focus on a national security strategy that calls for concentrating primarily on countering Russia and China.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump's top national security officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Bolton, have spent most of their public messaging time talking about those three situations rather than about longer-term threats.\n\nJames Carafano, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation, said he didn't see the developments as a drift away from the strategy, but rather as inevitable confrontations, noting that the strategy shift was less about abandoning them and more about lessening focus on transnational terrorism.\n\n\"A big part of Venezuela is the U.S. showing the Russians and the Chinese it's going to maintain dominance in the Western Hemisphere,\" he said. \"Iran is always part of the mix because it's the chief destabilizer in the Middle East. And North Korea directly threatened the United States.\"\n\nA senior State Department official said dealing with these brewing crises hasn't taken away from the Trump administration's focus on Beijing and Moscow.\n\nThe United States has tried to curb the expansion of Chinese firms such as Huawei and China Mobile, albeit with mixed success. Washington has called out the alleged mistreatment of China's Muslim minority population and blocked certain Chinese investments.\n\nThe State Department official noted the wide array of sanctions against Russia for interfering in the 2016 election, poisoning a former Russian spy in Britain and intervening in Ukraine, though the punishments largely came at the urging of Congress. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss administration strategy.\n\nThe Trump administration has worked relatively closely with allies on its approach to Venezuela, but it has broken with allies in Europe over Iran and at times has clashed with South Korea over how to handle talks with the Kim regime.\n\n\"The world is changing, and the United States' ability to manage things in the way it used to, believing we had the wisdom and the foresight and the resources to tackle all things simultaneously, and other countries were inclined to go along, that's definitely changed,\" said Chris Preble, vice president for foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of confrontations with North Korea, Venezuela and Iran, Trump has also been applying economic pressure to China, most recently hiking U.S. tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods.\n\nApart from a high-profile strike on Syrian leader Bashar al Assad's air force in 2017 over chemical weapons use, and the continuation of operations in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, Trump has largely been skeptical of taking new military actions. With China, however, he has demonstrated a comfort with employing blunt economic force.\n\n\"The one source of some comfort is that Trump does seem to be risk averse when it comes to military action, and I'm sure the U.S. military are reinforcing him in that regard,\" Dobbins said. \"The more dangerous of these situations in the short to medium term is probably the Chinese one, since that's an area where he has been less risk averse.\"\n\nCarol Morello contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RLA-45unt18tKf6LotFBCsMV3pA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J3POHVDUWUI6TM7VKZZ634WRE4.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4778052", "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 295362420}, {"uri": "1134052063", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-12", "time": "09:54:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-12T09:54:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8039215803146362, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/world/europe/orban-trump-hungary-white-house.html", "title": "Trump Tries to Bring Hungary's Orban in From the Cold", "body": "BUDAPEST -- George W. Bush dodged it. Barack Obama refused it. But on Monday President Trump will grant Viktor Orban, Hungary's far-right prime minister, his first private audience with a president at the White House since he met Bill Clinton there in 1998.\n\nBack then, Mr. Orban was a young centrist who praised Mr. Clinton for helping Hungary to escape Russian influence by joining NATO, but today he is a doyen of right-wing nationalists on multiple continents. He has enfeebled democratic institutions, strived to achieve a Hungarian ethnic homogeneity and pulled his nation closer to the opponents of American influence, Russia and China.\n\nHis welcome at the White House is seen by Mr. Trump's critics as emblematic of the president's preference for strongman leaders who seek to undermine the liberal international order.\n\n\"This visit is par for the course in terms of this administration's interest in aligning itself with autocrats and would-be autocrats,\" said Robert G. Berschinski, a former deputy assistant secretary of state under Mr. Obama, now a senior vice president at Human Rights First, a watchdog group.\n\nBut Mr. Orban's invitation to the White House reflects a more complex knot of considerations than just a shared political outlook, analysts and diplomats said. An Oval Office meeting is one of the highest honors an American president can give an ally, and this one has been slow in coming.\n\nThe Hungarian prime minister is in fact the last leader in Central Europe to be invited to the White House under Mr. Trump, even though Mr. Orban was, in July 2016, the first foreign leader to endorse Mr. Trump's candidacy for the presidency.\n\nAnd the day after Mr. Orban's visit, State Department officials will meet in Washington with a pair of center-right opposition politicians from Hungary who beat Mr. Orban's party in two recent by-elections.\n\n\"This was much more difficult for Orban to get than people think,\" said Andras Simonyi, a former Hungarian ambassador to the United States and NATO who now works as an academic in Washington.\n\n\"This silly idea that there is this unity between Trump and Orban is nonsense -- Orban has been wanting this visit for two and a half years,\" Mr. Simonyi added. \"It's embarrassing for Orban.\"\n\nRather than a reward or an affirmation, the meeting can instead be framed as a carrot -- an attempt to persuade Mr. Orban to buy American weapons and give greater priority to American foreign policy interests.\n\nThough Mr. Trump has often spoken warmly of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, some of Mr. Trump's most senior advisers, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have expressed concerns about the influence Russia and China wield in Hungary and other Central European countries.\n\nA bipartisan group of senators, including the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, James E. Risch, wrote to the president on Friday to warn of Hungary's \"downward democratic trajectory and the implications for U.S. interests in Central Europe.\"\n\nMr. Orban's lawmakers have granted a form of diplomatic immunity to an obscure Russian bank with connections to the Kremlin, a decision that American officials fear will allow the bank to act as a hub for Russian spies in Europe. And his administration gave residency documents to a Russian lawmaker, as well as relatives of the head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service.\n\nWhen two arms dealers were captured in Hungary, following an investigation by American law enforcement officials, Mr. Orban's government angered their American counterparts by extraditing the dealers to Russia instead of the United States.\n\nAmerican officials are also keen to discourage the Orban government from allowing the Chinese firm Huawei to build the local infrastructure for 5G wireless internet.\n\n\"This is more about long-term American strategic interests than about rewarding or not rewarding Orban, even if it looks otherwise,\" Mr. Simonyi, the former ambassador, said.\n\nSensitive to the perception of embracing another illiberal autocrat, administration officials insisted during a conference call with reporters on Friday that the government has raised concerns about Mr. Orban's actions at lower levels.\n\nMr. Orban met at the White House with Vice President Dick Cheney in 2001 but was refused a formal Oval Office meeting with Mr. Bush in 2002, shortly before he lost power to the Hungarian socialist party. His successor, Ferenc Gyurcsany, was granted a White House visit with Mr. Bush in 2005. After Mr. Orban re-entered office in 2010 and began to subjugate the judiciary, take over the news media and gerrymander the electoral map, Mr. Orban was snubbed repeatedly by the Obama administration.\n\nWithout question, the Trump administration has been warmer to Mr. Orban, who shares with Mr. Trump a dislike of immigration, independent institutions that can check his power, and international institutions that they say undermine national sovereignty.\n\nThat outward comity stands in contrast to the obvious friction between the Trump administration and longstanding American allies in Europe and elsewhere. Last Tuesday, Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State, canceled a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany with only a few hours of notice and instead made a quick trip to Iraq -- a decision perceived in Germany as a snub. He announced the same day that he would meet this week with Mr. Putin in Russia.\n\nLast June, Mr. Orban was granted a phone call with Mr. Trump. In July, the State Department canceled funding for independent Hungarian news outlets that threatened to loosen Mr. Orban's grip on the Hungarian news media.\n\nTo head the State Department section on European affairs, Mr. Trump in 2017 named A. Wess Mitchell, an advocate of friendlier ties with European Union nations, like Hungary and Poland, whose governments oppose the liberal forces that hold sway within the European Union. But Mr. Mitchell resigned this year and is due to be replaced by a career diplomat, Philip T. Reeker, who has displayed no public affection for the Orban administration.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump's apparent affinity for the likes of Mr. Orban owes something to his envy of leaders who are rarely challenged at home.\n\n\"I can tell you, knowing the president for a good 25 or 30 years, that he would love to have the situation that Viktor Orban has, but he doesn't,\" David Cornstein, Mr. Trump's ambassador to Hungary, said in an interview published in The Atlantic on Thursday.\n\nDespite the Trump administration's greater engagement with Hungary, Mr. Orban has not responded with much good will of his own.\n\nHe has blocked high-level cooperation between Ukraine and NATO, and ignored American requests to stall the expulsion of the Central European University, an American college in Budapest whose continued presence in Hungary was a stated foreign policy goal of the Trump administration.\n\nMr. Orban also took months to agree to a new defense cooperation agreement with the United States which, though finally signed in April, has yet to be ratified by the Hungarian Parliament, which he largely controls.\n\nMr. Berschinski, the former State Department official, said that an Oval Office meeting was likely to have little effect on Hungarian policy, and some current officials at the department say privately that they agree.\n\n\"Viktor Orban is joining an increasingly long line of leaders -- from Vladimir Putin to Mohammed bin Salman to Rodrigo Duterte to Abdel Fattah el-Sisi -- that President Trump will say positive things about without getting much in return,\" Mr. Berschinski said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_novak@nytimes.com", "name": "Benjamin Novak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/12/world/12orban/12orban-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4784047", "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 295350840}, {"uri": "1133687142", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-11", "time": "17:22:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-11T17:22:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/world/asia/us-china-trade-war.html", "title": "Trade Standoff May Be Initial Skirmish in Broader U.S.-China Economic War", "body": "WASHINGTON -- A yearlong trade war between the United States and China is proving to be an initial skirmish in an economic conflict that may persist for decades, as both countries battle for global dominance, stature and wealth.\n\nProgress toward a trade agreement nearly collapsed this past week, with both sides hardening their bargaining positions. And even if a trade deal is reached, it may do little to resolve tensions between the world's two largest economies.\n\nThe United States is increasingly wary of China's emerging role in the global economy and the tactics it uses to get ahead, including state-sponsored hacking, acquisitions of high-tech companies in the United States and Europe, subsidies to crucial industries and discrimination against foreign companies.\n\nThe Trump administration has begun trying to limit China's economic influence in the United States and abroad, warning about China's ambitions in increasingly stark terms. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, compared China's ambitions to Russia and Iran in a speech in London last Wednesday, saying Beijing poses \"a new kind of challenge; an authoritarian regime that's integrated economically into the West in ways that the Soviet Union never was.\"\n\nThe United States has been erecting barriers to limit Chinese investment in American companies, re-examining the kinds of technology that can be exported to China and restricting China's role in building America's next-generation telecommunications networks, while also discouraging other countries from using Chinese equipment.\n\nThe F.B.I. has increased its scrutiny of Chinese researchers in the United States over fears they may be acquiring intellectual secrets. A Justice Department initiative is targeting commercial espionage of American technology, and earlier this year the United States unveiled a sweeping indictment of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, over accusations of stealing trade secrets and evading American sanctions on Iran.\n\nChina, whose ambition is to dominate industries of the future, is pushing back. A column on Saturday in the Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper stated, \"The United States is again waving the club of tariffs after misjudging China's strength, capacity and will, further escalating trade friction between our two countries.\"\n\nThe piece was written under the pen name Zhong Sheng -- the \"voice of China\" -- a name used when the paper publishes comments on foreign affairs that are authoritative.\n\nRestraining China's ambitions and methods is a tricky task -- and there is concern that the Trump administration's effort is creating a new red scare, fueling discrimination against China and its citizens that could ultimately hurt the United States. As many as 30 Chinese professors have had their visas to the United States canceled in the past year, or been put on administrative review, according to Chinese academics and their American counterparts.\n\n\"We've got decades of painful negotiating with China ahead,\" said David Lampton, a China scholar at Stanford University. Mr. Lampton said a trade deal, if reached, would do little to resolve the bigger conflict. \"It's just a skirmish in an ongoing battle.\"\n\nChinese negotiators returned to Beijing over the weekend without a trade agreement and with even larger economic barriers between the two countries. The Trump administration raised tariffs on $200 billion in exports on Friday and said it would move ahead with the legal process of taxing another roughly $300 billion of products at the same 25 percent rate.\n\nThe two countries could yet come to an agreement that opens opportunities for businesses and rolls back the levies they have placed on each other. Both American and Chinese officials said on Friday that they would continue to talk and could meet in Beijing next month. Liu He, China's vice premier, called the failure to reach a deal \"just a small setback in the talks between two countries,\" while Mr. Trump, in a tweet, described the talks as \"candid and constructive.\"\n\nWhile a trade deal could calm some tensions and establish more good will between the two nations, it is unlikely to achieve many of the ambitious goals that the administration has set for itself. Mr. Trump's advisers, in particular the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, have been focused on what the administration calls China's practices of \"economic aggression.\"\n\nBut the administration has struggled to address the immensity of the problems in the text of a trade deal. People close to the talks say that the negotiators appear powerless to force any changes that aren't in China's interest.\n\nMr. Liu, who is leading China's team in the trade negotiations, hinted at that uphill battle in a video statement released by the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n\"Now both sides have reached consensus in many respects, but frankly there are also areas of disagreement,\" he said. \"We believe that these are major matters of principle, and any country has its own important principles -- we can't make concessions on matters of principle.\"\n\nDespite punishing tariffs already on nearly half of Chinese exports to the United States, Beijing is still resisting many of the most significant changes that the administration seeks. It has been reluctant to roll back subsidies for advanced manufacturing industries or to make public commitments to stop cybertheft.\n\nInstead, a trade deal between the two countries seems more likely to bring change around the margins -- tens of billions of dollars of soybean purchases, some tariffs lifted and changes to the text of Chinese laws or regulations that the country might ultimately disregard, particularly once another administration occupies the White House.\n\n\"This is a decades-long endeavor,\" said Robert Daly, the director of the Wilson Center's Kissinger Institute on China and the United States. \"This can't be waved away over cake at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nThe notion that the United States has one last shot to change China's behavior is held by an array of people on both sides of the political spectrum. But it is an aggressive notion of American power to upend a rival system that has delivered prosperity for its people and put China on course to be the world's largest economy.\n\nMany in China see the United States as a declining power bent on enforcing its will on a world that no longer cowers before its hegemonic might. The troubles in American democracy and the long economic slump after 2008 persuaded many in China that its instincts to chart its own course were correct. In the eyes of many Chinese, their country is simply reclaiming its historic status as a dominant regional power in Asia.\n\nIt has also projected power across Asia, Africa and elsewhere while the United States has, on many fronts, retreated from its post-World War II commitment to the global order. But it has done so with little application of military force, in sharp contrast to what many in China see as American militarism.\n\nMany in China have sought to avoid a trade conflict, which could have a larger impact on their economy than the United States'. But they have long thought the United States would have a difficult time accepting a true peer in economic, technology and military power, so consider the management of conflict with the United States to be an inevitable result of their own rise.\n\nWhile the Trump administration accused China of breaking a trade deal, China's resistance to the emerging terms stemmed from its belief that the United States was asking too much and offering too little in return. Many of the changes the United States seeks would limit what Chinese officials regard as a tried-and-true approach of using tens of billions of dollars from state-owned banks and government investment funds to turn previously small industries like car production or solar panel manufacturing into the largest industries of their kind in the world.\n\nAnd the Chinese view some of the Trump administration's demands as infringing on their sovereignty and giving America too much power over their economy -- including requiring it to codify changes through legislation in the National People's Congress. To the increasingly nationalistic public in China, the American requests are reminiscent of 19th century history of unequal treaties forced on the country by foreign powers.\n\nIn the United States, China's unwillingness to bow to America's demands is uniting lawmakers like the Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.\n\nThat is a significant shift from the prevailing view in the United States since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 that close economic engagement with China would produce an increasingly democratic country that would be closely tied to an international economic order founded mainly on Western liberal ideals.\n\nThat has not happened.\n\nChina has indeed grown in prosperity, leaping into the ranks of what the World Bank defines as upper-middle income countries. Its economy is now bigger than any other country except the United States. Its manufacturing sector is now bigger than those of the United States, Germany and South Korea combined.\n\nBut in the last five years, China has veered toward increasingly repressive authoritarianism at home and a rapid military buildup. The State Department estimates that Beijing has put 800,000 to two million Muslims in hastily built internment camps ringed with barbed wire in northwestern China. The Chinese government has built an archipelago of air bases on artificial islands in the South China Sea in between Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. And China now has the world's largest navy and has conducted military exercises as far away as East Africa and the Baltic Sea.\n\nOn the economic front, the competition is even fiercer. Trump administration officials warn that China is trying to dominate the global 5G infrastructure that will be the basis for future mobile communications and is competing to set other technological standards that will determine which global companies win.\n\nChina is extending low-cost loans and building infrastructure around the globe through its One Belt, One Road program, which critics warn is making poorer countries beholden to China. It is out-investing the United States in some high-tech industries, and is gaining dominance in certain segments, like mobile payment, new energy vehicles and areas of artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile American companies have long hankered for access to China's growing market, their position has begun to shift as they see China's practices and treatment of foreign companies. A survey released by the American Chamber of Commerce in China in February showed that the majority of its members favored retaining tariffs on Chinese goods while trade negotiations continued.\n\nChina's own experts say that the Beijing leadership has been caught off guard by the pace of change in American perceptions of Sino-American relations.\n\n\"Even if there is some kind of agreement between Xi and Trump, in the long run the strategic bilateral relationship is already in trouble,\" said Zhang Jian, a professor in the School of Government at Peking University. \"There is no coming back, even if there is a deal.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/12/us/12dc-tradewar-sub-2/merlin_153827598_526c0d28-e557-4511-a8da-a90f4aa0af0b-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4782070", "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 295291320}, {"uri": "1133234652", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-11", "time": "00:06:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-11T00:06:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-seeks-removal-of-huaweis-lead-defense-lawyer/2019/05/10/a3232d5a-6da4-11e9-be3a-33217240a539_story.html", "title": "Justice Department seeks removal of Huawei's lead defense lawyer", "body": "By Ellen Nakashima Ellen Nakashima National security reporter May 10 at 7:48 PM\n\nFederal prosecutors are seeking the removal of the lead defense lawyer for a Chinese firm charged with bank fraud and sanctions violations, alleging he has a conflict of interest arising from his supervision of a \"substantially related\" case while he served in a prior position as the Justice Department's second highest ranking official.\n\nJames Cole, who was deputy attorney general from 2010 to 2015 in the Obama administration, heads the defense team for Huawei Technologies Co. The major Chinese telecom equipment-maker was indicted in January on charges of bank fraud, wire fraud, violations of Iran sanctions and conspiracy to launder money and to obstruct justice.\n\n[Justice Dept. charges Huawei with fraud, ratcheting up US-China tensions]\n\nThe high-profile case has drawn much publicity as it is taking place against the backdrop of President Trump's efforts to seal a trade deal with China and efforts by his administration to keep Huawei out of the global 5G wireless networks on national security grounds.\n\nIn a redacted motion filed Friday in the Eastern District of New York, prosecutors argued that Cole's work in the related investigation, which they did not disclose, \"creates the real risk that he will breach his duty of confidentiality to the [Department of Justice] by relying on information he obtained while representing the department\" in the course of defending Huawei.\n\nMoreover, they said, \"there is a risk that Cole will breach his duty of loyalty to the department by making arguments on behalf of the defendants that contradict positions he previously took while representing the DOJ.\"\n\nNeither Cole nor his attorney responded to a request for comment.\n\nThe move to disqualify is fairly unusual, but analysts note that if the government believes there is a conflict of interest, prosecutors have an obligation to bring it to the court's attention.\n\nCole, a partner at Sidley Austin, informed the Justice Department in January that he was representing Huawei. Later that month, DOJ informed Cole he had a conflict of interest in the case, according to the motion.\n\nIn a follow-up meeting, Cole, DOJ and the FBI met again to discuss the issue, and after giving him a one-day clearance, the government provided Cole with \"privileged and classified\" information \"in order to have a fulsome discussion,\" prosecutors said.\n\nIn March, Cole declined to recuse himself, writing to the government that after carefully considering the material, he and his counsel \"were unable to determine that I need to be disqualified.\"\n\nLater that month he filed a motion to appear in court for Huawei. And at the first status conference on April 4, the government said it would not oppose Cole's motion for the time being. Last Thursday, prosecutors asked the court to have him removed.\n\n\"It's a considerable decision to seek to disqualify not just any counsel in a major prosecution like this, but someone of Jim Cole's pedigree as a former deputy attorney general who clearly has refused to recuse himself,\" said David Laufman, a former senior Justice Department official who is now a partner at the law firm of Wiggin and Dana. \"But the government clearly feels strongly about its motion and is prepared to litigate its merits.\"\n\nWhile the deputy attorney general oversees a broad range of the department's most significant cases, he or she does not typically get involved in the day-to-day running of investigations.\n\n\"It's difficult to determine whether the government has a valid argument because of the classified nature of the underlying matter,\" said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan who teaches law at the University of Michigan. \"The court will have to review his response and the underlying documents to make a determination. \"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/f3K7qXgxyJCXYjbadRZlCSgVKjs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZT4KSKDTPUI6TC7AZJLVM4HJDQ.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4781544", "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 295229160}, {"uri": "1133215952", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-10", "time": "23:18:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-10T23:18:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.800000011920929, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/business/huawei-lawyer-james-cole.html", "title": "Huawei's Prosecutors Ask Judge to Remove Its Lead Lawyer", "body": "Federal prosecutors want to disqualify the former deputy attorney general who is defending the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies in a bank fraud case because the government believes his previous work for it poses a conflict of interest.\n\nIn a filing on Friday in federal court in Brooklyn, prosecutors said the attorney, James M. Cole, should not be permitted to represent Huawei because he had been briefed on an undisclosed investigation while serving as a top prosecutor in the Obama administration.\n\nThe filing is redacted, making it difficult to ascertain the exact nature of the investigation. But Mr. Cole's tenure at the Department of Justice -- from the end of 2010 to the beginning of 2015 -- may have overlapped with the period when federal authorities were gathering information on Huawei and its business dealings.\n\nMr. Cole is now co-head of the white-collar and investigations practice at the Sidley Austin law firm. A spokeswoman for the firm did not respond Friday to requests for comment on the disqualification attempt.\n\nHuawei had said that it would \"vigorously oppose the government's motion,\" and that there was no justification for \"denying Huawei its constitutional rights.\" The company did not respond to requests for comment on Friday.\n\nThe attempt to disqualify Mr. Cole is unusual; corporate defendants are generally entitled to be represented by a lawyer of their choosing. But it was not a surprise.\n\nLast week, federal prosecutors notified the judge in the case, Ann M. Donnelly, that they had filed a sealed motion to disqualify Mr. Cole. The letter did not offer a reason, but prosecutors said they would file a redacted version by Friday.\n\nThe 26-page redacted motion said that Mr. Cole had refused a request to recuse himself, and that his representation of Huawei \"poses real and irresolvable conflicts of interest.\"\n\nSidley Austin has been representing Huawei since at least 2017, when a subpoena was served on the company, and Mr. Cole had become involved some time after, the filing said. Prosecutors said there could be \"no confidence that Cole will not use, whether intentionally or not, information obtained\" in the unidentified investigation.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Brooklyn have also charged Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder.

Since 2011, China Mobile has sought federal permission to provide services connecting phone calls between people in the United States and other countries, operating as a critical nexus for international phone traffic.\n\nBut Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai charged that the firm is \"owned and controlled by the Chinese government,\" a tie that raised a \"significant risk\" that authorities there could \"conduct activities that would seriously jeopardize the national security, law enforcement and economic interests of the United States.\"\n\nThe agency's Republicans and Democrats largely agreed, and some encouraged the FCC to take additional, future steps to block Chinese-tied telecom giants from operating in the United States or selling their equipment here. Their calls for further scrutiny come at a moment of tense talks between the White House and Chinese officials over tariffs the U.S. has imposed in response to the president's claims that the existing bilateral trade relationship is unfair.\n\nChina Mobile did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n[How China's Huawei took the lead over U.S. companies in 5G technology]\n\nFor Pai and the FCC, the decision to deny China Mobile access to U.S. networks marks the Trump administration's latest salvo against China over security concerns. Broadly, top U.S. officials have raised alarms about the potential for snooping when the country's top carriers begin deploying the infrastructure for 5G, the next generation of ultra-fast wireless service.\n\nMost of the equipment that makes 5G wireless possible is manufactured internationally, including in China by its top telecom company, Huawei. Its worldwide scale, its backing by China's state-owned development bank, and its perceived ties to a government known for espionage have fueled fears that U.S. networks could be at risk if more of Huawei's equipment is deployed here. U.S authorities, however, have never offered a full accounting of the security risks Huawei poses -- and Huawei has rejected the charges.\n\nStill, the White House for more than a year has considered issuing an executive order that could allow the government to prevent American businesses from working with certain foreign suppliers -- a move that could have the effect of barring Chinese firms. A spokesman for the president did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.\n\nAt the same time, the FCC has opened debate on rules that would withhold billions of dollars in critical federal funding from U.S. telecom carriers that purchase and install equipment from countries deemed to be security risks -- another effort that would deal a major blow to Huawei. Many U.S. carriers in rural areas rely on Huawei's equipment because it is cheaper than the alternatives, and they've warned they could become \"collateral damage in a larger national security and trade debate.\"\n\nAhead of Thursday's vote to block China Mobile, Democratic FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks urged his peers to return to the Huawei matter \"quickly to resolve any uncertainties\" involving carriers who have already deployed that equipment.\n\nCommissioner Brendan Carr, a Republican, urged the FCC to take aim at two other Chinese carriers, China Telecom and China Unicom, that already have been granted waivers to operate in the United States. \"The evidence I've seen in this case calls those existing authorizations into question,\" he said in prepared remarks, pointing to reports that China Telecom \"has been hijacking U.S. traffic and redirecting it through China.\" Neither of those companies responded to a request for comment.\n\nPai, the commissioner's chairman, later said the agency is reviewing authorizations the agency has granted those two companies.\n\nAnd Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel -- who voted to block China Mobile -- still criticized the agency's efforts as \"performative security,\" noting it did little to change the status quo. She pointed to other vulnerabilities in U.S. networks, including recent reports about the misuse of Americans' location data, in calling on the FCC to redouble its efforts to protect Americans' sensitive information.\n\n\"Here's a hard truth: Today no communications system is ever fully secure,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7olMIuFsEIchRGVYkB21Hiu_Lfg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2KGT5CD374I6RLCOIIPPOFSZEM.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4776734", "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 295121340}, {"uri": "1132076769", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-09", "time": "15:36:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-09T15:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/chinese-court-delays-ruling-on-canadians-death-sentence-appeal/2019/05/09/d0a9e098-7263-11e9-b5ca-3d72a9fa8ff1_story.html", "title": "Chinese court delays ruling on Canadian's death sentence appeal", "body": "By Anna Fifield Anna Fifield Beijing bureau chief. May 9 at 11:10 AM\n\nBEIJING -- A Chinese court has delayed ruling on a Canadian man's appeal against his death sentence for drug smuggling, just hours after a Canadian court set a September date for the next hearing in an extradition case against a top Chinese executive.\n\nThe ruling by the Chinese court further fuels concerns that Robert Lloyd Schellenberg's case is being influenced by politics.\n\n\"Why wait? What's the reasoning?\" asked James Zimmerman, an American lawyer in Beijing who represented two Canadian citizens detained in a previous, unrelated tit-for-tat case. \"Announcing later probably means the issue is too sensitive and 'we'll keep it in our back pocket for leverage.' \"\n\nSchellenberg, 36, \"made a very clear and complete self-defense,\" his attorney, Zhang Dongshuo, told Canada's Globe and Mail. It is the Canadian's final formal avenue for appeal against his death sentence.\n\nSchellenberg was sentenced in November to 15 years in prison and a $22,000 fine after being convicted of conspiring to send a quarter-ton of methamphetamine to Australia hidden in a shipment of tires. He denied the charge, saying he was in the port city of Dalian as a tourist.\n\nLess than a month later, Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer at Huawei Technologies and daughter of the company's founder, on a U.S. arrest warrant. The Justice Department wants to charge her with violating sanctions against Iran.\n\nHuawei is a \"national champion\" in China, and Meng is corporate royalty.\n\n[Canada arrested Huawei's Meng for the United States. As China retaliates, it's on its own. ]\n\nThe case quickly became a flash point between Canada, which says it is simply following the law, and China, which has accused Canada of doing the United States' dirty work. China has since arrested two Canadian nationals, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, and blocked much of Canada's canola and pork exports.\n\nA month after Meng's arrest, China declared Schellenberg's 15-year prison term too lenient and sentenced him to death, a decision that was widely seen as retribution.\n\nSchellenberg challenged the decision, and the Liaoning High People's Court met Thursday to consider his appeal, stressing that it was adhering to the law.\n\n\"During the trial, the appellant Schellenberg's various legal rights were guaranteed in accordance with the law, and two defense lawyers and an interpreter hired by court appeared with him,\" the court said in a statement.\n\n\"More than 50 people, including Canadian embassy officials, National People's Congress deputies, Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference members and people from different circles, attended the trial,\" it said.\n\nBut the authorities did not allow entry to diplomats from nine other countries who had traveled to Dalian for the hearing, including representatives of the United States, Britain, and other European nations, including Germany and France.\n\nOne diplomat said the representatives traveled to Dalian to show the Chinese authorities that they were watching the case very closely. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing declined to comment.\n\nAnother Canadian, Fan Wei, was sentenced to death in Guangdong late last month in another drug trafficking case.\n\nThursday's hearing started just hours after a Vancouver court adjourned after setting a timeline for Meng's extradition case.\n\nMeng is due back in court in September, and her attorneys have said they plan to argue that her arrest was an \"abuse of power\" and that she should not be extradited to the United States.\n\n[In a twist, Canada asks U.S. for help cracking down at its southern border ]\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Thursday that China's position was clear.\n\n\"The U.S. and Canada abused their bilateral extradition treaty and took compulsory measures against a Chinese citizen without reason. This is a severe violation of the legitimate rights of the Chinese citizen and also a severe political incident,\" he said at a regular news briefing. \"We again urge the U.S. to revoke the arrest warrant and extradition request against Meng Wanzhou. We again advise Canada to take seriously China's position to release her and allow her to return.\"\n\nThe Canadian government has called on China to grant clemency for Schellenberg and to release Kovrig and Spavor, who have been held in unknown locations since their arrests on Dec. 10.\n\nKovrig, who was the International Crisis Group's China analyst, is being investigated on suspicion of spying and stealing state secrets, charges that the think tank strenuously denies. Spavor, who was based in the North Korean border city of Dandong and ran exchanges with North Korea, stands accused of supplying Kovrig with intelligence.\n\nWhile Meng is living in her multimillion-dollar home in Vancouver, the two Canadian men are kept in cells with the lights on round-the-clock.\n\nThey have been denied access to lawyers or family members and have had short consular visits once a month, during which they are not allowed to discuss the cases against them with the embassy officials.\n\nLiu Yang contributed to this report.\n\nChina accuses two detained Canadians of stealing state secrets\n\nJustice Dept. charges Huawei with fraud, ratcheting up U.S.-China tensions\n\nU.S. to proceed with case against Huawei executive held in Canada", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3PTpLAVev-2NrmXCB9n3V2kuqQA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CLYOTCTSNQI6THYGL7BO5AACPI.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4777059", "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 295112160}, {"uri": "1131927387", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-09", "time": "12:26:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-09T12:26:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5372549295425415, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-finance-202/2019/05/09/the-finance-202-trump-is-underestimating-the-damage-higher-tariffs-could-have-on-u-s-economy/5cd31125a7a0a46cfe152c96/", "title": "Analysis | The Finance 202: Trump is underestimating the damage higher tariffs could have on U.S. economy", "body": "President Trump is dragging a dangerous misconception into a critical moment in his standoff with the Chinese. And American businesses and consumers stand to pay the price.\n\nTrump believes that the Chinese -- not Americans -- will absorb the pain of 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow morning if trade talks with a Chinese delegation in Washington today don't yield an agreement.\n\nTrump on Wednesday again said he is \"very happy with over $100 Billion a year in Tariffs filling U.S. coffers .\u2009.\u2009. great for U.S., not good for China!\"\n\nEconomists say the president is persistently wrong about how tariffs work: American importers and consumers have borne the brunt of the duties he has imposed so far -- and will continue to shoulder the burden if Trump follows through on his threat.\n\nFurther, they say, the scale of the fight he's proposing to mount against the world's second-biggest economy will bring fallout at home for the economy as a whole and compound pain for key industries and consumers.\n\nThe overall impact of the new tariffs would not be enough, say, to drag the U.S. into a recession. But it would have a measurable impact on economic growth, said economists I interviewed.\n\nJoel Prakken, chief U.S. economist for Macroeconomic Advisers by IHS Markit, projects a .1 percent hit to GDP growth this year and next if the new tariffs are implemented. Others say it will be greater: Ryan Sweet, director of real-time economics at Moody's Analytics, estimates a .3 percent impact.\n\n\"That's not enormous,\" he says, but he points to \"spillover effects,\" including newly turbulent financial markets that could in turn rattle business confidence, slowing new investment. \"The economy's fundamentals overall are solid, and the odds of a recession are low. The risk is we talk ourselves into one.\"\n\nAnd the relatively modest macro effects of the tariffs may be cold comfort to those businesses in the crosshairs and consumers set to face higher prices on goods from soap to air conditioners. The new levies \"would apply 25% levies on more than $40 billion worth of items purchased directly by consumers -- furniture, handbags, clothing, Christmas decorations, fire alarms and other things shoppers find on the shelves at Target, Walmart, Macy's and other stores,\" the Wall Street Journal's Josh Zumbrun wrote this week.\n\nAmerican shoppers already have been facing higher prices from the levies the Trump administration has so far imposed. A study published in March from economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Columbia University and Princeton University found that in 2018, Trump's tariffs were costing consumers and the firms importing targeted goods an extra $3 billion a month in extra taxes.\n\nThe burden has been particularly acute for certain key sectors, including auto parts companies, which help form the manufacturing base in Ohio.\n\n\"Their costs have gone up because of steel and aluminum and other electronics we buy from China,\" says Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \"The end user probably isn't willing to eat all of those costs, so the companies are doing less well, and the workers for those companies aren't going to do as well and won't see wage increases they might have gotten.\"\n\nBusiness chiefs are warning the pain will only get worse if Trump escalates the battle.\n\nPolaris Industries CEO Scott Wine, whose company makes snowmobiles, ATVs, and motorcycles, said Tuesday the escalation would be \"catastrophic\" for his business. \"Through no fault of our own, one-third of our net income could go away,\" he told CNBC.\n\nEmerson Electric Co., a large manufacturer that produces everything from climate control systems to garbage disposals, has raised prices to keep up with higher costs from the tariffs, but its commercial unit has still seen its profit margins shrink. The company estimated tariffs on the books would cost it $125 million this year. The latest ISM manufacturing survey is littered with executives citing tariff worries, though others say they've already priced in a possible escalation.\n\nThe damage would be compounded by the moves Beijing makes to strike back. Chinese officials on Wednesday pledged to launch \"necessary countermeasures\" if the Trump administration goes through with the Friday escalation.\n\nIt's not clear yet what those might be. But farmers have already gotten a taste. Beijing has slapped steep tariffs on American soy, corn and wheat exports; after Trump's Sunday tweets, grain markets dropped to a 42-year low. Farmer bankruptcies, meanwhile, have been soaring, in part due to tariff pressures -- rising nearly a third in six Midwestern states last year.\n\nYet even as the next round of Trump tariffs look imminent, the administration appears to have left itself some wiggle room to extend this week's negotiations without implementing them.\n\nThe Trump team's official notice of the new levies carves out any shipments already on their way here from China when the tariffs would take effect. \"They didn't put this language in there when they made these announcements last year,\" Bown notes, speculating it could be an attempt to buy some extra time for the talks.\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\n-- China fires back: Beijing made it clear it is not backing down in the face of Trump's threats. In fact, China warned it stands ready to retaliate in the escalating trade war, my colleague Anna Fifield and David J. Lynch report.\n\nThe Chinese have taken a harder line because they thought Trump was desperate for a deal. The suddenly tougher posture from Beijing owes to an April 30 tweet by Trump complaining that while the Chinese central bank is helping stimulate growth there, the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, according to reporting by the WSJ's Lingling Wei and Bob Davis. Chinese negotiators took that as a sign that Trump viewed the U.S. economy as fragile and would be eager to compromise.\n\nTrump: \"They broke the deal.\" The president, addressing a rally in Florida on Wednesday night, via Reuters: \"You see the tariffs we're doing? Because they broke the deal. ... They broke the deal. So they're flying in. The vice premier tomorrow is flying in, but they broke the deal. They can't do that. So they'll be paying. If we don't make the deal, nothing wrong with taking in more than $100 billion a year.\"\n\n-- Huawei executive gets new bail terms. \"A Canadian judge on Wednesday altered the bail terms of a Chinese tech executive facing possible extradition to the United States on fraud charges, granting her lawyers' request that she be allowed to move from a $6 million, six-bedroom house in Vancouver to a $16 million, seven-bedroom mansion,\" the New York Times's Dan Bilefsky reports.\n\nTrump's role: The president previously said he was willing to \"intervene\" in Meng's case, comments that Meng's lawyer, attorney Scott Fenton, said he would use to prove the charges are politically motivated and they were \"'intimidating and corrosive of the rule of law' and should disqualify the United States from being able to extradite Ms. Meng,\" Bilefsky writes.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump appears to be losing the battle to ban Huawei gear from global networks, Bloomberg reports.\n\nNew York lawmakers advance bill allowing release of Trump's state tax returns: \"The New York State Senate passed legislation Wednesday that would allow President Trump's state tax returns to be turned over to congressional committees, a move that could pave the way for House Democrats to obtain the president's closely guarded financial records,\" my colleague Jeff Stein reports. \"The bill must still be approved by the State Assembly and signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D-N.Y.), but Cuomo has expressed support for the measure and Democrats have a majority in the legislature's lower chamber.\"\n\n-- Global stocks flinch in face of trade tensions. WSJ's Paul Davies: \"European and Asian stocks fell Thursday as China hardened its line going into trade talks set to start later in Washington. Shares across Asia fell with Chinese A-shares down 1.5% in Shanghai, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong 2.4% lower and Korean stocks down 3%. The Stoxx Europe 600 was 0.7% lower in early trade, while the FTSE 100 in London was down 0.5%.\n\n\"U.S. stocks were priced to open lower on Thursday with futures on both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average down about 0.8%. The broad index was down 0.2% at the close on Wednesday, having been up as much as 0.5% earlier in the day.\"\n\nBut it could be worse. The S&P 500 was down 2.2 percent over the first three days of this week, \"only about a month's worth of gains; markets were lower as recently as early April,\" the New York Times's Neil Irwin points out. He cites a \"Trump Put\" bucking up investors even as U.S.-China trade talks look to be deteriorating this week. That is, investors believe Trump keeps an eye on the health of financial markets and will strike \"some kind of deal, even if it does little to address long-term economic tensions between the United States and China,\" to reverse a market rout.\n\n-- Bond market sends up a warning flare. Bloomberg's Robert Burgess: \"Global markets got a glimpse of the unthinkable Wednesday when the U.S. held a key bond auction. The $27 billion sale of 10-year notes - the world's benchmark securities - didn't go well at all. It wasn't a failure; that would have triggered no less than an Armageddon-type event on par with the financial crisis. But the poor demand sure sparked a lot of questions, including whether this was a sign that investors finally had enough of the government's profligate spending and borrowing...\n\n\"Nothing scares big investors more than the notion that the U.S. could hold a bond auction and nobody showed up. After all, Treasuries are the world's safest investment, backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. But on Wednesday, investors sent a message to the Treasury Department that past isn't prologue when it comes to demand for U.S. debt.\n\nPrescription drug ads will soon have to include pricing information. \"Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Wednesday that the Trump administration is finalizing rules for drugmakers to disclose list prices of medications costing more than $35 for a month's supply,\" the Associated Press' Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar reports.\n\nRemember: There have multiple reports that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) staff and the White House are discussing a deal to lower prescription drug prices. Trump made lowering prices one of the centerpieces of his campaign and polls show the issue continues to be among the top concerns of voters. But with everything going on, it's probably safe to bet that much more limited policies like requiring some price transparency are more likely that a sweeping bipartisan deal.\n\nThe Export-Import bank is back ... for now. After inspiring some \"of the most bitter disputes in Republican circles this decade,\" the Export-Import bank now has enough board members to form a quorum again, my colleague Paul Kane reports. \"No federal agency has lived such a bizarre state of suspended animation,\" Paul sums up of the protracted battle between conservatives and more mainstream Republicans over the future of the agency that provides loan guarantees to U.S. companies doing business abroad.\n\nThe future of Fannie and Freddie: \"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's new overseer said the mortgage giants can be freed from government control even if Congress doesn't pass a housing-finance overhaul,\" Bloomberg's Austin Weinstein reports. \"Lawmakers will get 'at least an entire Congress' to act before the companies are freed, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria said during an interview with Bloomberg.\n\n'Impressive': How Fox News is talking about Trump's taxes:\n\nSee baby Archie: Prince Harry and Meghan debut newest royal baby:", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/f497f1025a45d13cc1a2b569118bd197-4228-2819-70-8-AASUCEDR4EI6TEZRGC6FQNXURY.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4770178", "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 295100760}, {"uri": "1131629141", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-09", "time": "05:04:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-09T05:04:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/09/pompeos-visit-britain-shows-special-relationship-adrift/", "title": "Analysis | Pompeo's visit to Britain shows the special relationship adrift", "body": "By Adam Taylor Adam Taylor Foreign reporter who writes about a variety of subjects May 9 at 12:59 AM\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know? Sign up for the Today's WorldView newsletter.\n\n(Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg)\n\nAs Britain welcomed a swaddled, snoozing baby named Archie to their royal family on Wednesday, there was another, less heralded and less tranquil, arrival in London: That of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nIn Britain for his first visit since becoming the top U.S. diplomat, Pompeo offered a relentless defense of U.S.-British relations, telling reporters that \"the special relationship is the beating heart of the free world.\" Pompeo even offered a rare positive spin on the economic effects of Brexit in a speech at the Center for Policy Studies.\n\n\"President Trump is eager for a new free-trade agreement that will take our Number 1 trade relationship to unlimited new heights,\" he said.\n\nBut for all these optimistic words, Pompeo's time in London was ultimately a reminder that at the moment, this transatlantic partnership is not as rosy as Meghan and Harry's.\n\nPompeo repeatedly used British history to chide the government for not following Trump administration policy. Asked at a news conference about the Iran nuclear deal, from which President Trump withdrew the United States one year ago -- despite protests from the British government -- the secretary of state invoked Winston Churchill's battle against Nazi Germany.\n\n\"So not far from here are the Churchill War Rooms, where a leader of this great country stared evil in the face and recognized the threat that evil presented to the entire world,\" Pompeo said. \"We're working together to push back against that threat.\"\n\nHours later, he pondered how the late British Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher would have handled a rising China, after media reports about Britain's willingness to work with the Chinese telecom giant Huawei.\n\n\"Would the Iron Lady be silent when China violates the sovereignty of nations through corruption or coercion?\" he said. \"I know it's a sensitive topic, but we have to talk about sensitive things, as friends.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Pompeo, not all Britons have his rosy view of Westminster's relationship with Washington. Pompeo may hark back to the days of Churchill and Thatcher, but many Britons still have bitter feelings about more recent history -- in particular, the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that Britain supported.\n\nNow, the Trump administration's recent combative tone with Iran has people worried again. The United States issued new sanctions against Iran on Wednesday after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani threatened to start enriching more uranium.\n\nThe United States deployed an aircraft carrier and bomber group to the Persian Gulf this week in what it said was a response to an Iranian plan to attack U.S. military personnel in the region. The Times of London's Richard Spencer wrote Wednesday that the Trump administration's Iran strategy represented \"undoubtedly, the single most dangerous near-term threat to world peace.\"\n\nPompeo was questioned about conflict in the Middle East during his trip. During a meeting with faith leaders Wednesday morning, he was pushed by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the leader of the Church of England, on how foreign military intervention helped create conditions that led to the declining Christian population in Iraq. \"Foreign interventions can often have very serious long-term consequences,\" Welby said.\n\nThis skepticism of American foreign policy extends beyond Middle Eastern matters. Pompeo found himself faced with doubts concerning the U.S. role in backing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 in a bid to topple Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that his Labour Party opposes \"outside interference in Venezuela, whether from the U.S. or anywhere else.\"\n\nWhen a journalist asked Pompeo what he made of Corbyn's apparent support of Maduro, Pompeo said in unusually undiplomatic language that it was \"disgusting\" to see leaders back the \"murderous dictator.\"\n\nFew thought that Pompeo's insult would harm Corbyn's reputation. In fact, it might aid it. \"A top Trump official calling Corbyn 'disgusting' is a gift to Corbyn, regardless of where you stand on Venezuela,\" tweeted British journalist Mehdi Hasan.\n\nEven on Brexit, a policy that Trump openly supports, U.S. trade policy is a real worry for London. A Guardian editorial that coincided with Pompeo's visit noted that Trump's trade deal with China, if it comes to pass, would bypass the World Trade Organization -- the very institution on which Brexit hard-liners hope to fall back in the event of a \"no-deal\" Brexit.\n\nSo if British interests are so out of line with the United States's, why is Trump heading to London in June for a state visit? Writing in the New Statesman last month, Stephen Bush noted that Trump's unpopularity among Britons \"weakens Brexit just by association.\"\n\nPart of the problem is that, beleaguered by Brexit, Britain has left many other foreign policy problems -- including the fraught special relationship with Trump -- on autopilot, yielding directionless and contradictory policies.\n\n\"On Iran, Britain remains caught in its own corridor of uncertainty between the contrasting responses of its European and American allies, while on Huawei it is trapped between its increasing engagement with China and the age-old temptation of refighting the cold war,\" the Guardian's Martin Kettle wrote Wednesday.\n\nThere had been some hope that baby Archie, entitled to a U.S. passport through his American mother, might herald a new era in Anglo-American relations. \"This was good news on both sides of the Atlantic,\" Pompeo said.\n\nBut if there is a baby who sums up the current state of the special relationship, it isn't Archie. It is the big, fat, orange, diaper-wearing blimp that is expected to rise, once against, to greet Trump as he arrives in London on June 3.\n\nRight now, like the blimp, the special relationship is at risk of floating away, adrift.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

This is just what China wants -- to divide western alliances,\" Mr. Pompeo said.\n\nMr. Pompeo also said at an earlier news conference, however, that he has \"great confidence that the United Kingdom will never take an action that will break the special relationship,\" a reference to the close ties of the two nations and a comment that reassured some British officials that damage to relations with the United States can be avoided.\n\nBritain's foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told reporters that the government had not made its final decision on Huawei, and would never take a decision that would compromise its ability to share intelligence with its closest allies, \"or in particular with the United States.\"\n\nBritish officials believe that it is possible to give Huawei some access to noncore elements of its new 5G system while maintaining the security of more sensitive networks.\n\nThe United States has warned several governments around Europe against working with Huawei, and the topic has become increasingly touchy as countries decide on how to build their 5G networks.\n\nThe issue is particularly delicate for a British government that is planning to leave the European Union and wants to forge stronger economic links with China and other Asian economies, while also building on its close diplomatic and trading relationship with the United States.\n\nMr. Williamson was fired last week after an investigation into a report in The Daily Telegraph regarding discussions about the Huawei decision in Britain's National Security Council, of which Mr. Williamson was a member.\n\nThe article suggested that Mrs. May had overruled objections from some cabinet ministers, including Mr. Williamson, about bringing the Chinese company into the 5G project. Mr. Williamson has denied being the source of the leak.\n\nIn Parliament on Wednesday, Julian Lewis, a senior lawmaker in Mrs. May's Conservative Party and chairman of the House of Commons Defense Committee, asked the prime minister whether it would not \"be na\u00efve to the point of negligence to allow Huawei further to penetrate our critical national infrastructure.\"\n\nMrs. May said she was \"not considering any options that would put our national security communications at risk, either within the U.K. or with our closest allies.\"\n\nDuring his visit, Mr. Pompeo, who held talks with Mrs. May and Mr. Hunt, also made an apparent swipe at their political adversary, Jeremy Corbyn, the left-wing leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party. Speaking at his news conference, Mr. Pompeo described the support of some politicians for the Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, as \"disgusting.\"\n\nUnlike the British government, Labour has refused to condemn Mr. Maduro, arguing that Venezuela's political future was a matter for its own citizens.

Raymond Zhong, a technology reporter based in Beijing, discussed the tech he's using.\n\nWhat are your most important tech tools for reporting in China?\n\nThe Chinese internet is like the small-town setting of a crime novel: Things are mysteriously disappearing from it all the time.\n\nSocial media posts vanish. News and blog articles are taken down. Sensitive bits are excised from videos. You can't always predict what will be removed, either by censors or by a regular person starting to have second thoughts about his or her own unfiltered utterance. Even pages on the websites of government agencies and major corporations have a way of quietly falling into black holes.\n\nThat's why a Google Chrome extension called Full Page Screen Capture is invaluable for internet research in China. With one click, I get a screen shot of an entire page, top to bottom. An embarrassingly large share of the files on my laptop are PDFs generated this way. I only wish a similar function were built into my iPhone, as it is on Huawei handsets.\n\nGoogle sometimes caches past versions of web pages, as does the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. These crawlers don't preserve everything. But when you manage to discover in the archives the exact page you've been hunting for, frozen for posterity at exactly the right moment, it's an incredible endorphin rush.\n\nFor capturing streaming videos before they are taken down, I use QuickTime Player to take a recording of my screen. There are also sites that convert videos from YouTube and other platforms into downloadable files. I won't name these services. The video sites don't like them, so they're constantly being shut down.\n\nReporting in an authoritarian country is a struggle of memory against forgetting. These tools help.\n\nHow does online consumerism like shopping and ordering food delivery differ there? How do you personally use these apps?\n\nI spent most of my adult life not buying much online except books. But, oh Lordy, have I fallen for e-commerce since moving to Beijing last year.\n\nTo scroll through Taobao, Alibaba's largest shopping platform, is to be awed by the sheer amount of our physical world that is being produced in China. Normal stuff like dustpans and kitchen timers. Weird stuff like latte cups shaped like skulls, wine glasses with a built-in straw and Barbie dolls that serve as racks for slices of raw meat before they go into a hot pot. Detailed knockoffs of Lego sets and whatever latest abominable thing Justin Bieber has been photographed wearing.\n\nDo you know how many vendors are out there selling giant pillows printed to look like pieces of grilled meat? I bet that you do not.\n\nMy head swims with grandiose thoughts when I'm on Taobao. Thoughts like: Factories are making this stuff because people buy it. Who are these people? How do the factories even find out about them? What if shopping apps, and not social media, are the real mirror that mobile technology is holding up to our society?\n\nCome to think of it, I still don't buy that much online. I just like to look and ponder.\n\nMany people in China have stopped using cash. They conduct their entire lives on a single app, WeChat. Electric cars are everywhere. Is China \"The Jetsons\"?\n\nNo, though I do often see people on hoverboards barreling down city streets while talking on their cellphones.\n\nChina is rightly recognized for having made big leaps in the digital realm. But there are many unglamorous reasons behind Chinese tech companies' success.\n\nLabor is cheap, and cities are densely populated -- perfect for e-commerce, ride-hailing, and food and grocery delivery. People also tend to adopt new technologies with gusto because in a country that was quite poor not long ago, it's not easy to get misty eyed about life before the internet.\n\nThe offline world in China is still rough in some ways. The skies are polluted. The traffic is bad. Staffs in shops and restaurants are surly. Most people will happily use technology to avoid all this if they can.\n\nA few months ago, I had a broken water pipe at home, and for some reason I decided to call a plumber who had left his number on a sticker in my building. He ripped me off, big time. Next time I'm trying an app.\n\nEven dealing with the Chinese bureaucracy is getting less torturous, sort of. This year, the tax authorities want more people to use their app. Which sounds good, except I still had to go across town and show my passport to get the six-digit code needed to activate the app.\n\nHoverboards aside, what gadget trends are emerging?\n\nIn a country as gadget crazy as China, it's interesting that smart speakers aren't taking off as they are in the United States. A lot of people I know are buying hand-held voice translation devices, usually for older relatives. They don't work so well, I'm told. But at least they try to solve a real problem.\n\nRecently, I watched a waiter in a hotel restaurant communicate with foreign guests using a voice translation app. \"China needs to get better at English to become stronger in the world,\" the waiter said, and the app read out his words in English.\n\nIt was all very poignant -- until one guest barked at the waiter about a broken juice machine, and the app dutifully translated his insults into Chinese.\n\nOutside of your job, what tech product are you personally obsessed with? What's so great about it, and what could be better?\n\nChina is a glorious place to be a karaoke lover, and Exhibit No. 1 is the nation's ubiquitous karaoke booths. For a couple of bucks, you and a friend can squeeze into a soundproof glass box and sing your hearts out for 15 minutes before going back to your normal lives.\n\nThe booths are everywhere in Chinese cities. In malls, in movie theaters. I've even seen them outside factories, so workers can nip out for a rousing round of \"My Way\" before returning to the assembly line. One time, I saw people singing in booths at the Beijing airport at 6:30 in the morning.\n\nI must say I like the idea of karaoke booths more than the actual experience. The ventilation isn't great. You have to wear headphones, and there's something about karaoke that is diminished when you experience it through headphones. Or maybe I just don't sound as good singing \"Try a Little Tenderness\" as I think I do.\n\nIn the end, karaoke might be another thing that was probably best left undisrupted by technology.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "raymond_zhong@nytimes.com", "name": "Raymond Zhong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/08/business/08techusing1/08techusing1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 295017300}, {"uri": "1130954314", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-08", "time": "10:50:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-08T10:50:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/canada-helped-the-us-arrest-meng-wanzhou-as-it-gets-punished-by-china-its-on-its-own/2019/05/07/c8152fbe-6d18-11e9-bbe7-1c798fb80536_story.html", "title": "Canada helped the U.S. arrest Meng Wanzhou.

(Lindsey Wasson/Reuters) By Emily Rauhala Emily Rauhala Staff writer covering Canada and foreign affairs May 8 at 6:00 AM\n\nIn its diplomatic battle with China, Canada could use some backup. But its closest ally, the United States, seems to be occupied waging other wars.\n\nSince Canada arrested a Chinese technology executive on U.S. charges in December, China has hit Canada hard, detaining two Canadians on vague allegations and stopping some imports of canola oil, a key Canadian product.\n\nThe U.S. officials seeking to extradite Huawei Technologies' chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, offered Canada a polite \"thanks\" for arresting her. But as China punishes Canada for fulfilling the U.S. request, there has been little help from the White House, which is focused, for now, on cutting a trade deal with China.\n\nWith Meng due in a Vancouver courtroom Wednesday for a hearing to schedule the start of the extradition process, an exasperated Canada is bracing for further political or economic retaliation from Beijing -- and no longer expecting much from Washington.\n\n\"Not only are we navigating around a hostile China, but we need to do that without all the guarantees and protections that we have had in the past,\" said David Mulroney, who served as Canada's ambassador to China from 2009 to 2012.\n\nThe Canadian conundrum raises a question familiar to small countries that have found themselves in China's bad books: How do you stand up to a soon-to-be-superpower, particularly without clear, consistent U.S. support?\n\nSo far, Canada has struggled.\n\n[In a twist, Canada asks U.S. for help cracking down at its southern border]\n\nMeng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, leaves her house for a hearing at the British Columbia Supreme Court in Vancouver in March. (Jimmy Jeong/Bloomberg)\n\nThe conflict between Canada and China started with Meng's arrest in December on charges that she violated U.S. sanctions law by misstating her company's relationship with a subsidiary.\n\nHer arrest outraged Beijing. Soon, two Canadians in China, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, were detained on national security allegations that have yet to be explained. Then, a Canadian who had been sentenced to 15 years in Chinese prison for drug smuggling was hastily retried and sentenced to death.\n\nBeijing has cast Meng's arrest as a politically motivated foreign plot to contain China.\n\nOttawa has argued her arrest was a routine law enforcement matter, stressing that Canada was adhering to the terms of its extradition treaty with the United States, and that Meng will be treated just like anyone else -- an argument it expected to be echoed by the United States.\n\nInstead, President Trump shocked both Canadian and U.S. officials by tweeting that he would consider intervening in Meng's case if it could help him secure a favorable deal on trade.\n\nU.S. officials have since tried to walk that back, expressing the country's commitment to the rule of law and, at a news conference to unveil a range of charges against Huawei, thanking Canadian allies for their help. But uncertainty over the U.S. position lingers.\n\nCanadian officials know that a Trump tweet is not a policy statement and have tried to engage other U.S. officials. They have regularly raised the detention of the two Canadians with American colleagues.\n\nJim Carr, Canada's minister for international trade diversification, said the government is discussing the situation with allies \"literally every day.\"\n\n\"When you need your friends, you talk to your friends about how you need them,\" he said during a visit to Washington this week. \"Our American allies are aware of the situation.\"\n\n[Quebec ban on religious symbols would fall heavily on hijab-wearing teachers]\n\nSecurity guards march past a shop selling Apple and Huawei phones in Beijing. (Ng Han Guan/AP)\n\nSome are frustrated that this awareness has not translated into action.\n\nCanada's ambassador to the United States, David MacNaughton, has pointed out that Canada is cooperating with the United States on several fronts, including Venezuela and NATO. He told Reuters last week that it might be less inclined to continue that assistance if it keeps getting nothing back.\n\n\"How do you go to canola farmers and relatives of the two [Canadian detainees] and say, 'Well, actually, notwithstanding all of this, we're going to try and do whatever we can to help?'\" he asked.\n\n\"It makes it much more difficult in public-opinion terms for the prime minister to have permission to do some of the things that would be in both countries' interests.\"\n\nA Canadian official familiar with the issue said Canada was not about to change course on questions of foreign policy such as the crisis in Venezuela -- but is indeed exasperated.\n\n\"We hope they will help us anyway,\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"This is causing some pain on our side, and we want to see a meaningful commitment from the rule of law on their side.\"\n\nCarr's job is to find new trading partners for Canada, which has long been heavily dependent on the United States. He said the dust-up reaffirmed the importance of his mandate.\n\n\"It makes sense, both in the medium and the long term, to develop other relationships, because you don't how bilateral relationships will go.\"\n\nRead more\n\nQuayside, Toronto's Google-linked smart city, draws opposition over privacy, costs\n\nMarijuana vs. beer: The new divide in Canadian politics\n\nCanadian trauma surgeons called for gun control.

It has since accused her of, among other things, fraudulently deceiving four banks to enable Huawei to evade American sanctions against Iran, and has accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets and obstructing a criminal investigation.\n\nWednesday's proceeding is not the extradition hearing itself but a proceeding to discuss next steps in the case.\n\nWhile awaiting a decision on her extradition -- which could take many months -- Ms. Meng has been out on bail of 10 million Canadian dollars, living in Vancouver in her $6 million, six-bedroom home. She can roam fairly freely about the city, although under 24-hour surveillance and wearing a GPS tracker on her ankle.\n\nIncensed by Ms. Meng's arrest, China has retaliated by arresting two Canadians, accusing them of espionage, while also sentencing two other Canadians to death on drug-related accusations.\n\nChina is also using its economic might to punish Canada. Recently, Beijing halted shipments of Canadian canola oil, saying they were contaminated; China bought about $2.7 billion worth of canola oil from Canada last year.\n\nChina has also suspended the permits of two large Canadian pork producers.\n\nAnd when the Canadian agriculture minister recently requested a trade visit to China, Canadian officials said the request was ignored.\n\nAll the while, President Trump is trying to hammer out a trade deal with China, and Canada is concerned that its citizens have become pawns in a geopolitical and economic battle between the United States and China in which Canada is paying a heavy price.\n\nShortly after Ms. Meng's arrest, Mr. Trump said he might consider interceding in the case if that helped him make a trade deal with China. Ms. Meng's lawyers have used his comment to bolster their argument that the criminal charges against Ms. Meng are politically motivated, which could possibly help her case.\n\nIn recent weeks, senior Canadian officials have expressed annoyance that the United States, a critical ally, is not doing enough to help secure the release of the two arrested Canadians -- Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman.\n\nIn an interview this week with Reuters, Canada's ambassador to Washington, David MacNaughton, expressed concern that Canada remained \"in the dark\" as to whether Mr. Trump was prepared to drop charges against Ms. Meng as part of a \"plea deal.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland tacitly warned the Trump administration not to link Ms. Meng's fate to a potential trade deal. \"Any effort to somehow suggest that a justice issue should be mixed up with influence of trade issues is entirely inappropriate,\" she said.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods. Canadian officials say privately that they fear Mr. Trump could use Ms. Meng as a bargaining chip in the trade talks, without sufficiently addressing the case of the detained Canadians.\n\n\"Canada is appealing to the U.S. for help but it is in a weak position and doesn't have a lot of cards to play,\" said Wenran Jiang, a senior fellow at the Institute of Asian Research at the University of British Columbia. \"It can't control Trump, and retaliating against China risks escalating tensions even more.\"\n\nLegal experts said that, under Canadian law, Ms. Meng faces an uphill struggle to avoid extradition.\n\n\"Due to Canadian extradition law, extradition is a stacked deck against the defendant, in this case Ms. Meng, because the evidence the defense can introduce is very limited,\" said Gary Botting, a leading extradition expert who has written several textbooks on Canadian extradition law and has advised Ms. Meng's legal team. \"An extradition hearing is not a trial.\"\n\nNevertheless, he noted that the final decision on extradition rested with Canada's justice minister, making it inevitable, he said, that politics could intervene in a proceeding that Canadian authorities have been at pains to emphasize must adhere to the rule of law.\n\n\"The politicization of the case is her best defense,\" he said.\n\nHe said he also expected her lawyers to emphasize the argument made in a separate civil case that Canadian authorities breached Ms. Meng's constitutional rights to due process when they stopped her while she was in transit, seizing her electronic devices, detaining her for three hours before she was arrested and denying her immediate access to a lawyer.\n\nHe cited a 2001 case of four men arrested in Canada and wanted in the United States in connection with a $22 million telemarketing fraud scheme.\n\nCanada's Supreme Court ruled that the United States had lost its right to extradite the men after a Pennsylvania prosecutor warned during the extradition process that the men could be raped in jail if they didn't surrender quietly.\n\n\"Their extradition hearing was compromised because the U.S. prosecutor interfered with their due process in a Canadian court,\" Mr. Botting explained.\n\nReferring to the manner in which Ms. Meng was arrested, he said her lawyers were likely to make a similar argument.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_bilefsky@nytimes.com", "name": "Dan Bilefsky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/08/world/08canada-huawei1/08canada-huawei1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4774807", "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 295006920}, {"uri": "1129231767", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-06", "time": "12:00:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-06T12:00:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2019/05/06/the-cybersecurity-202-a-cyberattack-just-disrupted-grid-operations-in-the-u-s-but-it-could-have-been-far-worse/5ccf61eda7a0a46cfe152c3e/", "title": "Analysis | The Cybersecurity 202: A cyberattack just disrupted grid operations in the U.S. But it could have been far worse.", "body": "A Pacific Gas and Electric Company worker cuts back branches from a tree that fell across power lines. (Kevin Johnson/Santa Cruz Sentinel/AP)\n\nA recently disclosed hack at an electric utility in the western United States crosses a disturbing new line.\n\nIt's the first time a digital attack is known to have interfered with electrical grid operations in the United States. And it was due to a relatively basic hack, raising the specter of what might happen if a sophisticated bad actor chose to launch a far more powerful attack, say, with the intent of shuting off electricity for millions of people.\n\nThe disruption, which took place March 5, was caused by a denial of service incident, an Energy Department official told E&E News's Blake Sobczak, who was the first to report on the issue. That means the utility -- which serves parts of California, Utah and Wyoming though the Energy Department didn't name it -- was basically overwhelmed with phony Web traffic.\n\nThe attack didn't cause customer outages or affect the reliability of the grid -- and there's no evidence it was part of a coordinated attack aimed at doing so, Blake reported. It's possible the attackers didn't even know they were targeting an electric utility.\n\nBut the fact that there was a disruption at all on critical infrastructure puts it in a highly concerning category. The best known successful grid attack by highly sophisticated hackers had far-reaching consequences: Hackers allegedly linked to the Russian government targeted portions of Ukraine's energy grid with a denial of service attack in 2015 and cut off electricity for several hours to tens of thousands of people.\n\nThat kind of outage, if it took place in the U.S., could cause hundreds of millions of dollars of damage or even cost lives -- for example, if hospitals were caught without a backup electricity supply.\n\nA 2015 report by the University of Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies estimated a major grid attack in the United States could cost up to $1 trillion in the most severe circumstances.\n\nThe disruption also highlights how poorly many utilities are prepared for such an attack.\n\nAccording to Blake, the attack relied on a computer bug that was widely known -- and there was a software patch that fixed it. That means if the utility had updated patches on all of its systems, the whole thing could have been averted.\n\nThe Energy Department has shared very little information about the hack. Most of what's known comes from a report that the department typically publishes after outages caused by major storms or other events that interrupt electrical supply. A report such as that may be triggered if a digital attack hit a target at the edge of a utility's network, such as a firewall or router, that doesn't affect core operations, industry sources told Blake.\n\n\"While a cyberattack on such equipment wouldn't disrupt the flow of electricity, it could force operators to pause or redirect certain activities at affected facilities to allow for an investigation,\" he reported.\n\nThe attack should be a wake-up call about the importance of ensuring utilities are consistently and effectively protecting themselves against cyberattacks, Robert M. Lee, a former NSA hacker who founded the cybersecurity company Dragos, said during a panel discussion I moderated Thursday.\n\nBut Lee also warned against overreacting to such attacks, which he said are sure to become more prevalent in coming years. After all, he said, electricity services are quite resilient and it would be exceptionally difficult to shut off power across a large area for a long time.\n\n\"I don't want to make light of threats poking and prodding our infrastructure,\" he said. \"But we also don't want to hype up the challenge.\"\n\nPINGED: President Trump during a lengthy phone conversation Friday didn't warn Russian President Vladimir Putin against interfering in the 2020 election, my colleagues Anne Gearan, John Wagner and Anton Troianovski reported.\n\nThat's despite stark warnings from intelligence and Homeland Security officials that Russia probably will attempt to undermine the 2020 contest as it did in 2016.\n\nTrump and Putin did, however, discuss the conclusion of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign -- which the president described as the \"Russian hoax\" on Twitter.\n\nAccording to Trump, Putin responded to the conclusion of the Mueller investigation by saying \"something to the effect that it started off as a mountain ... it ended up being a mouse.\" The president added that Putin \"knew there was no collusion whatsoever.\"\n\nMueller did not find sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against any members of the Trump campaign for assisting Russia's 2016 election interference operation.\n\nTrump has wavered on U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election -- often saying that he believes Russia interfered but other actors might have as well (including an anonymous 400-pound hacker).\n\nThe phrase \"Russian hoax\" gives Trump wiggle room to cast doubt on Russian interference in 2016 without outright claiming it, Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said on Twitter.\n\nPATCHED: Representatives from more than two dozen countries during a meeting in Prague on Friday agreed to a broad set of principles for how to secure 5G networks against spying and cyberattacks -- including language supported by U.S. diplomats that would make it tougher to give 5G contracts to Huawei and other Chinese firms.\n\nBut it's unclear how effective the voluntary agreement will be in actually restricting Huawei from U.S. allies' 5G networks. The agreement comes after several European nations, including Britain, have opted to allow Huawei to build some portion of their networks -- despite intense lobbying from U.S. diplomats who say the company could be a platform for Chinese spying.\n\nAmong other things, the Prague agreement urges nations to consider the \"overall risk of influence on a supplier by a third country\" and how bound a 5G supplier is by the rule of law. The White House praised the principles in a statement and said the United States plans to abide by them as it contracts to build its own 5G networks.\n\nPWNED: Facebook has told U.S. officials it's \"willing to submit to greater oversight of its data-collection practices -- from the launching of new services to the decisions of its top executives -- to end a wide-ranging federal probe into a series of privacy abuses that came to light last year,\" my colleague Tony Romm reported.\n\nThe enhanced oversight, if approved, would accompany a $3 billion to $5 billion fine over a slew of cases in which the social media giant allegedly failed to sufficiently safeguard users' personal information.\n\n\"Under such a settlement, Facebook would have to complete a more rigorous privacy review of new products and services before launching them,\" Tony reported, and would have to document to the FTC how it had evaluated the effects of data collection practices on its customers.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/cc674c1d79fa9fcfa250d59b061c7869-2958-2091-70-8-C74P7VSVUEI6TKUDKBHQQ27V2Y.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 294840000}, {"uri": "1127333900", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-03", "time": "13:31:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-03T13:31:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/national-digest-man-who-plotted-to-bomb-new-york-subways-then-spent-a-decade-helping-police-is-set-for-release/2019/05/02/87d59900-689c-11e9-8985-4cf30147bdca_story.html", "title": "National Digest: Man Who Plotted to Bomb New York Subways Then Spent a Decade Helping Police is Set for Release", "body": "Bomb plotter who helped police set to be released\n\nA man who plotted to bomb New York City's subways, then switched sides after his arrest and spent nearly a decade helping U.S. authorities identify and prosecute terrorists, was rewarded for his help Thursday with a sentence of 10 years in prison, effectively time he has already served.\n\nNajibullah Zazi, a 33-year-old naturalized citizen who became radicalized and received explosives training from al-Qaeda after traveling to Pakistan in 2008, faced up to life in prison after pleading guilty to terrorism-related charges.\n\nThe subway plot sent shock waves through New York and the federal law enforcement community, underscoring the continuing threat of terrorism years after 9/11. But federal prosecutors said Zazi, after his 2009 arrest, provided \"extraordinary\" assistance to U.S. counterterrorism authorities, implicating his closest friends and offering a window into the inner workings of al-Qaeda.\n\nU.S. District Judge Raymond J. Dearie described Zazi's cooperation as \"unprecedented,\" referring in part to federal investigations that remain ongoing.\n\nZazi apologized and asked for forgiveness.

Circuit Judge Margaret Carey-McCray also gave him 10 years of supervised release after prison. McClinton pleaded guilty to arson on March 28.\n\nInvestigators said McClinton belonged to the church that was vandalized and burned, Hopewell Missionary Baptist in Greenville.\n\nSome initially suspected the fire was a hate crime. But Washington County District Attorney Dewayne Richardson said McClinton was trying to hide illicit activities he had done inside the church. The night the church was burned, the members had planned to gather and McClinton believed they were going to disclose those activities, Richardson said.\n\nMcClinton was sentenced as a habitual offender because of felony convictions for attempted armed robbery in 1997 and armed robbery in 2004, both in another part of Mississippi.\n\nA man who fled to Mexico after authorities identified him as a suspect in the rape of a Connecticut university student has pleaded guilty to multiple charges.\n\nThe Connecticut Post reported that Edibaldo Duran, 29, pleaded guilty Thursday to home invasion and aggravated first-degree sexual assault for the September 2014 attack on the Sacred Heart University student.\n\nHe faces 20 years in prison and is scheduled to be sentenced July 12.\n\nAuthorities say Duran broke into the victim's apartment while she was asleep and raped her.\n\nPolice released a sketch of the suspect based on the victim's description, and two witnesses later identified the sketch as Duran.\n\nPolice tracked Duran to JFK airport, but his plane was gone by the time they arrived. He was later found in Puebla, Mexico.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nProsecutors seek to disqualify defense attorney for Huawei: U.S. prosecutors on Thursday filed a motion to disqualify the lead defense lawyer for Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. from the case against the Chinese company for alleged bank fraud and sanctions violations, according to a filing in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. The lawyer, James Cole, is a former deputy attorney general of the United States. The government did not make public why it is seeking to remove Cole from the case. In a letter to the court, prosecutors said they had filed a sealed, classified motion to disqualify Cole and expected to file a public version by May 10.\n\nVirginia man held for suspected terrorism ties: Federal authorities have arrested a Virginia man accused of lying about his ties to foreign terrorist organizations. Justice Department spokesman Brian McGinn confirmed Thursday that Waqar Ul-Hassan was arrested at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina on Tuesday when he returned from Pakistan. A criminal complaint filed by a U.S. attorney's office in Virginia said Hassan lied to FBI agents in 2015 about collecting money and food for an extremist group in Pakistan, Jaish-e-Mohammad.

A Dose of Big Tech Data May Help", "body": "Each week, we review the week's news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nHi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news:\n\nI do it. You do it. We all do it: Look at screens. The. Whole. Time.\n\nTristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google who co-founded the Center for Humane Technology, recently issued a battle cry against the potent cocktail of data and algorithms that he said tech companies had designed to hijack human attention. He claimed that they were \"downgrading\" our attention spans, relationships, civility and more.\n\nThere's growing moral panic about our reliance on screens and the content, in particular social media, they display. My colleague Kevin Roose felt it, and forced himself to detox. (Spoiler: He liked it.)\n\nBut while researchers I've spoken with said the way we used devices could be troubling, they also said we didn't fully understand the problems or how to solve them.\n\nDr. Henrietta Bowden-Jones, the Royal College of Psychiatrists' spokeswoman on behavioral addictions, pointed out that not all screen time was equal.\n\n\"You can do all kinds of things on a phone,\" she said. \"The addiction is to the activity -- gambling, gaming, watching porn.\" Much of our time with screens can be a healthy, she added, analogous to, say, reading a book.\n\nA problem is that we lack granular insight about how people use their devices, making it hard to understand how damaging our relationships with them are.\n\nAs we've conducted more of our lives online, \"the amount of human behavior we can directly observe has been shrinking,\" said Andrew Przybylski, an experimental psychologist and director of research at the Oxford internet Institute. \"As time has gone on, the ability to formulate meaningful questions and then ask them of good data has diminished.\"\n\nExcept, some people do have access to such data: They work at companies like Facebook, Google and Apple. These companies all collect troves of information -- all locked away -- about how we use technology.\n\nInspired by our panic, Google and Apple have introduced tools to help users manage their digital activity. But should we trust tech companies to help curb tech use?\n\nMy colleague Jack Nicas reported that, since launching such tools for iPhones, Apple had purged other smartphone addiction apps from its App Store. Apple said it was over privacy violations; app makers said it was because their software could hurt Apple's business.\n\nIf the app makers are right, Apple is cornering the market on access to iPhone use data.\n\nThat would be troubling. If other companies and researchers had access to such data -- along with Facebook's likes, Netflix's streaming figures, Google's browsing histories and more -- they could study it to more accurately understand what is genuinely problematic about relationships with our devices, and develop meaningful interventions to overcome problems.\n\nThere are problems with this idea. Getting tech companies to give up data is hard, probably requiring regulatory intervention. Use of the data would obviously need to be closely policed. And it's slower than an intervene-first-think-later approach.\n\nBut if we're going to stop using screens, let's do it based on sound evidence.\n\nFacebook's new certainty: Uncertainty\n\n\"I know that we don't exactly have the strongest reputation on privacy right now, to put it lightly,\" Mark Zuckerberg told the crowd at Facebook's annual developer conference on Tuesday, a smile on his face. He paused, perhaps expecting laughter.\n\nThere was virtual silence.\n\nHe pushed on, describing a new, more private Facebook -- a bid to overcome the privacy and data scandals that have dogged his company. My colleague Mike Isaac explained what this would look like: more sharing in private groups, ephemeral content and encryption by default on messaging services.\n\nSounds promising! So why the silence? One reason, excepting Mr. Zuckerberg's delivery, was panic.\n\nFacebook is entering uncharted territory, and Mr. Zuckerberg isn't sure what the future looks like, according to an interview he gave to The Washington Post. Here are some takeaways:\n\n\u25a0 His business plan is hazy. \"I don't know how good of a business it will be, but I am confident it will be good,\" Mr. Zuckerberg said.\n\n\u25a0 He can't say how long the pivot will take. \"The next five years at least, maybe even the next 10 years, is building out the private platforms with the richness that the public platforms have had to date,\" he said.\n\n\u25a0 And impending regulation from all corners, perhaps the biggest threat to Facebook's future, is largely beyond its control.\n\nThe developers listening to Mr. Zuckerberg were aware of this, and the upheaval that the shift could cause them. Excuse them for not laughing.\n\nWhat keeps Uber up at night?\n\nUber spent the week on a roadshow, trying to persuade investors to buy its shares ahead of its initial public offering. As Mike Isaac reported, Uber's pitch draws parallels to Amazon: a do-anything juggernaut that will aggressively invest and diversify.\n\nInvestors have reportedly been asking hard questions about the rid-hailing company's growth, competition and market share. Which is reasonable, given that Uber dedicated 35,000 words in its I.P.O. prospectus to what could go wrong.\n\nHere are some of its biggest nightmares:\n\nEmployees. Uber labels its drivers contractors, not employees, to avoid paying a minimum wage. More than 60,000 drivers have filed or plan to file for arbitration to change that, a shift that could cost it billions of dollars. (It will be heartened by the Labor Department's recent decision to exempt an unspecified gig-economy company from that fate.)\n\nCompetitors' autonomous cars. Robo-cars are essential to Uber's profitability: They'll allow vehicles to offer rides 24-7 without human drivers, who currently share the takings. But if competitors like Waymo crack the technology first, Uber could be ruined.\n\nRegulation. It's 2019, and the authorities are after tech companies -- whether through outright blocks to Uber's taxi service or privacy regulations that crimp its ability to innovate.\n\nItself. For years, Uber was perhaps tech's biggest villain. It worries that its cultural and leadership fixes might not be enough to solve its lingering P.R. problems.\n\nAnd, um, restaurants and delivery companies? Uber's aggressive diversification means competitors are everywhere: Restaurants steal customers from its food delivery service, and companies like DHL compete with its freight service.\n\nAnd some stories you shouldn't miss\n\n\u25a0 Huawei has a culture problem. It seeks acceptance in the West, but its structure and value system -- shaped after the Communist Party's -- could stand in the way.\n\n\u25a0 Tech giants reported sliding financial results. Slumping iPhone sales shrank Apple's profit, and growth is faltering at Alphabet, Google's parent company.\n\n\u25a0 Border officials have designs on your devices. The American Civil Liberties Union found that two agencies -- Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- have \"near-unfettered authority to search and seize travelers' devices at the border.\"\n\n\u25a0 Sri Lanka's president lifted the nation's ban on social media. It was supposed to prevent the spread of misinformation after bombings on Easter.\n\n\u25a0 Drones: now delivering organs. One of the unmanned vehicles delivered a kidney last month to a Maryland woman who had waited eight years for a lifesaving transplant.\n\n\u25a0 I.P.O.s keep coming. Slack and WeWork are the latest tech unicorns to file paperwork for impending initial public offerings.\n\n\u25a0 Robots rule the roost at Amazon. The company dismissed the idea that robots would soon replace its warehouse workers, but machines are hiring and firing those employees.\n\n\u25a0 Qualcomm is getting at least $4.5 billion from Apple. That's the settlement from their lengthy patent battle.\n\nJamie Condliffe is editor of the DealBook newsletter. He also writes the weekly Bits newsletter.

Why Central European leaders are visiting the White House.", "body": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, center, arrives for a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, during the second Belt and Road Forum on April 25 in Beijing. President Trump has invited Orban to the White House on May 13. (Andrea Verdelli/AFP/Getty Images) By Emily Tamkin Emily Tamkin Reporter covering foreign affairs May 2 at 1:43 PM\n\nA casual viewer of the White House's upcoming schedule might ask: \"Why are Central European leaders getting invited to descend on Washington this spring?\"\n\nLast month, President Trump hosted Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis at the White House. This Friday, he will do the same for Peter Pellegrini, prime minister of Slovakia. And later this month, on May 13, the U.S. president will host Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban -- his first visit to the White House since 2001. (The last of the prime ministers of the so-called Visegrad group, Poland's Mateusz Morawiecki, was supposed to visit Washington last month, but his visit got postponed.)\n\nThat the Central European leaders would eventually get a Trump meeting is not, in itself, so surprising. Since former assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia Wess Mitchell, who was confirmed in the fall of 2017, came on the scene, the Trump administration's approach to Central Europe has looked dramatically different than Obama's.\n\nThe Obama administration, critics say, largely overlooked the region, refusing to engage until its increasingly illiberal leaders improved on human rights. The Trump administration, with a policy shaped by Mitchell, chose to not focus on human rights and instead to engage the region to compete with and counter Russia and China. In Mitchell's last week on the job, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled through the region, literally announcing that they were going to engage in the region by competing with Moscow and Beijing.\n\n\"I think there is a growing concern in Washington about great power competition in Central Europe (which you touched on in your earlier piece), especially with China's Belt & Road, Huawei, etc. Following in Wess Mitchell's footsteps, the administration's idea is to engage, be present in Visegrad countries, and not rattle anybody's cage too much,\" Dalibor Rohac, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute focused on European politics, wrote in an email.\n\nBut the White House meetings aren't happening because the countries visited have done what Pompeo asked. On the contrary. Since Pompeo's trip to Central Europe, Hungary has moved ahead with plans to welcome in a Russian development bank, and the Czech president (who, it should be noted, does not control Czech foreign policy) went to China to meet with the head of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company that the Trump administration has been working to counter in Europe.\n\nAnd issues highlighted by the United States in Hungary-U. S. relations -- for example, the expulsion from Budapest of Central European University, the institute founded by Hungarian-born American billionaire George Soros and Hungary's diplomatic spat with Ukraine -- remain.\n\n\"[It's] clear [the policy of re-engagement] hasn't worked -- countries like Hungary and the Czech Republic continue to deepen their ties with Moscow and Beijing,\" wrote Christopher Maroshegyi, senior director at Albright Stonebridge Group.\n\nIn addition to welcoming the Russian development bank and giving it diplomatic immunity, Hungary has also welcomed Huawei.\n\n\"Huawei runs its largest logistics center outside of China in Budapest and in a meeting with Huawei in April Hungary's Finance Minister said they would roll out Huawei equipment across the country,\" Maroshegyi wrote. Hungary has done one thing the Trump administration asked, or at least has said it will: Hungarian officials are reportedly negotiating a \"high-value arms deal\" with the U.S. government.\n\nBut the White House visits aren't, or aren't just, about trying once again to use Russia and China as leverage, nor are they just about arms deal money, experts say.\n\n\"The goal of the visits seems more likely aimed at deepening Trump's club of autocratic leaders and shoring up populist leaders ahead of European [Parliament] elections on May 23,\" Maroshegyi wrote. \"Otherwise it's hard to justify inviting such a controversial leader [as Orban] that is trying to raise his international profile to the White House just weeks ahead of a pivotal election.\"\n\nThe Visegrad leaders, like Trump, are outspokenly opposed to immigration and ardent nationalists. Orban has said that the upcoming European Parliament elections will be about the issue. \"We will decide whether to defend our Christian European culture or yield the terrain to multiculturalism,\" he told members and supporters of his party, Fidesz.\n\n\"I think Pompeo's visit to Budapest made a difference in detoxifying Hungary -- Orban made a big impression on him and they're seeing him now as an important European player who'll only grow in influence after the European election,\" said Rohac.\n\nAnd so Orban is coming to the White House. And the other, less controversial but still generally anti-immigrant leaders of Central Europe are, too.\n\nThe twist is that some in Central Europe don't appreciate being painted with the same brush: They may all take a hard line on immigration, but Hungary and Poland have run afoul of the European Union, and Hungary has even launched an anti-Brussels campaign.\n\n\"My hope is that Pellegrini can help de-homogenize Visegrad at his meeting with Trump tomorrow: affirm that Slovakia sees its place in Europe very differently from [Poland's Law and Justice] and Fidesz and also tell Trump that Central Europeans in general do not appreciate the administration's attitude toward the EU,\" wrote Rohac, who is originally from Slovakia.\n\n\"But I wouldn't bet on it.\"\n\nIt is, after all, the perceived ideological sameness that has likely helped get them, one by one, to the White House.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fIfh_d21X43bUjn0iRXAa88vJvw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4ZHVPZTHP4I6TJUYFKHYBDE47M.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4766718", "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 294516120}, {"uri": "1126673648", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-02", "time": "17:57:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-02T17:57:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5882353186607361, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/world/europe/uk-defense-secretary-leaks-daily-telegraph.html", "title": "Firing of Britain's Defense Secretary Raises Question: What Is a Leak?", "body": "LONDON -- After dismissing her defense secretary on accusations he leaked sensitive information, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain declared the matter \"closed,\" and on Thursday her government insisted that the police need not investigate one of the most serious security breaches in recent memory.\n\nBut the former defense secretary, Gavin Williamson, is not going quietly. In a series of interviews, he has sworn that he was not the source of the leak from the National Security Council reported in a Daily Telegraph article. He has demanded a police inquiry to vindicate him and accused one of the country's top civil servants of having conducted a vendetta.\n\nHis protestations of innocence have raised questions not only about Mrs. May's notoriously leaky cabinet, but also about how information is traded between Britain's top politicians and its leading journalists and the nature of a leak.\n\nMr. Williamson has not denied reports that he spoke by phone to the author of the article, the Daily Telegraph's deputy political editor, Steven Swinford, for 11 minutes on the day of the leak -- apparently the main evidence against him. Instead, Mr. Williamson seems to be arguing that the conversation was not responsible for the leak that has cost him job.\n\nThe episode has put a spotlight on a murky zone within Britain's fiercely competitive news media environment. There, political scoops are more often produced from sources that confirm stories with nods, winks or \"nondenials,\" rather than by handing over documents or making clear statements of fact.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Tom Newton Dunn, political editor of The Sun, speculated that any exchange of information would likely have been vague, and the conversation cloaked in an informal Westminster code.\n\n\"You don't ring up a minister and say, 'Will you leak this to me?' You say to him, 'Look, if I was to write, and I think that this happened, would I look particularly silly?' Mr. Newton Dunn explained.\n\nThe answer could come back, \"I don't think you look silly, Tom, at the best of times,\" or \"You do look particularly silly much of the time,\" said Mr. Newton Dunn, adding: \"That's the code. And that's how it would have happened.\"\n\nIn a Twitter thread, Gaby Hinsliff, a columnist and former political editor of The Observer, described the piecemeal way in which snippets of information are bounced around several sources to build a bigger picture.\n\n\"A little bit of info from lots of people who in each case don't think they really told you anything much -- quite a sizable stone sometimes,\" Ms. Hinsliff wrote.\n\nIn this way there can often be no one source of a leak, but several, all of whom can deny responsibility. Whether Mr. Williamson was one of those sources is now hotly contested.\n\nFiercely ambitious -- to his critics, gaffe-prone and self-promoting -- Mr. Williamson lost his job on Wednesday after being accused of a leak that suggested that Mrs. May would give a role in designing a British telecommunications network to Huawei, a Chinese company considered a security risk by the United States.\n\nThe report in the Daily Telegraph suggested that Mrs. May had overruled objections from some senior council members, including Mr. Williamson, about allowing Huawei to build some elements of the next-generation cellular data network known as 5G.\n\nAlthough the government says that no decision has yet been taken formally, the leak seems accurate enough to have infuriated Mrs. May who, when she ran for the leadership of her party in 2016, made a point about straight-dealing and her refusal to gossip with journalists in the bars of Parliament.\n\nThe leak also outraged senior civil servants, including the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, and caused friction with the United States. The Trump administration has asserted that Huawei's technology -- already widely installed in earlier generation systems in Europe -- could provide a \"backdoor\" for Chinese intelligence -- something the company has denied.\n\nMr. Williamson's ignominious dismissal is the latest crisis to engulf a cabinet so bitterly divided over Britain's withdrawal from the European Union that it was recently chastised by the chief whip, Julian Smith, for having displayed the \"worst example of ill-discipline in cabinet in British political history.\"\n\nOn Thursday, opposition parties joined Mr. Williamson in demanding a police investigation, and the Metropolitan Police commissioner, Cressida Dick, said her officers would \"look at any complaint.\" But she said under existing protocols the police needed a referral from the government. None had yet been received.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament, David Lidington, Mrs. May's de facto deputy, argued that a referral was not necessary, suggesting that Mr. Williamson is not being accused formally of breaking the official secrecy laws that senior ministers promise to obey.\n\n\"The issue at stake here was less the substance of the material that was disclosed than the principle of a leak from the National Security Council itself,\" said Mr. Lidington.\n\nEssentially, the government's argument is that the leak of anything discussed at such a confidential meeting puts at risk the functioning of the council, because it is attended by Britain's top intelligence officials who expect secrecy.\n\nMr. Williamson also was accused by the government of being less cooperative than other ministers with the leak inquiry, though it did not elaborate.\n\nDespite Mrs. May's lost confidence in Mr. Williamson, the government seems reluctant to try to prove Mr. Williamson's guilt.\n\nOn Thursday Mr. Lidington argued that the former defense secretary's overall conduct was at issue, and that makes Mrs. May \"the ultimate judge of the standards of behavior expected of a minister.\"\n\nIn an apparent dig at Mr. Williamson, Mr. Lidington added that after meetings of the National Security Council, ministers should \"shut up.\"\n\nThat appeared to echo Mr. Williamson's much-ridiculed words last year when he said that Russia should \"go away and shut up.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_castle@nytimes.com", "name": "Stephen Castle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/02/world/02britain1/02britain1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4761664", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 294515820}, {"uri": "1126535427", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-02", "time": "14:48:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-02T14:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2019/05/02/daily-202-amy-klobuchar-s-home-field-advantage-in-iowa/5cc9cbf81ad2e506550b2ed7/", "title": "The Daily 202: Amy Klobuchar's home-field advantage in Iowa", "body": "STORM LAKE, Iowa -- If Joe Biden fails to catch fire in Iowa on his third try for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Amy Klobuchar will be well positioned to make inroads with the kinds of voters who might otherwise back the former vice president.\n\nThe senator from Minnesota has been getting a more positive reception in the Hawkeye State than has been reflected in the polls, where she's in the back of the pack, or in the national media's coverage, which has focused more on candidates like Biden, Bernie Sanders and Beto O'Rourke.\n\n\"While there's a lot of attention on the B's right now, I would like to remind people that A comes before B and A will win out in the long term,\" Klobuchar joked during an interview last night. \"It just gives me time, with all the attention on these guys, to keep building steady support. And I note that Jimmy Carter and a number of other people were underdogs at this point in the race.\"\n\nBiden wrapped up his first foray into Iowa last night with a rally in Des Moines. Klobuchar will return to the state this weekend for her sixth trip since she launched her campaign in February. She will convene roundtable discussions on Saturday in Des Moines and Iowa City to discuss combating substance abuse and prioritizing mental health. And she'll host meet-and-greets near the campuses of Grinnell College and the University of Iowa.\n\n-- One thing Klobuchar has going for her is that she represents a neighboring state, which allows her to speak in a way that resonates with Iowans. Seven of Iowa's northern counties are in the Rochester, Minn., media market, which means folks see about as much news about Minneapolis as Des Moines. She can also talk in minute detail about the Minnesota Twins, one of the three baseball teams that Iowans tend to root for.\n\n\"It's helpful because there's people that know who I am, especially in the northern part. But I think it's more that I understand the people in Iowa,\" Klobuchar explained during an extended interview in Storm Lake last month. \"I understand what their issues are. That isn't an immediate gain; it's a long-term gain.\"\n\nKlobuchar said that a surprising number of Iowans have approached her to say that they checked with relatives or friends who live in Minnesota to ask how she's been as a senator before they came to see her speak -- and that her constituents have vouched for her job performance. \"Before they go to an event, they'll call their cousin in Burnsville and ask, 'What do you know about her?' Literally, people are coming up all the time and saying that,\" Klobuchar said. \"Because of the fact that I have a lot of support in my state, and in rural areas, I think that will have a long-term benefit.\"\n\nThis is certainly not going to be determinative, but it does offer a boost. Having a home-field advantage helps sports teams, of course, but they'll still lose games even when they're playing before a friendly crowd.\n\n-- Klobuchar also has a track record of winning the same kinds of Iowa voters who backed Barack Obama twice, when he carried Iowa, but then broke for Donald Trump in 2016. \"I have a very strong case to make about how I am able to get independent and moderate Republican votes,\" she said. \"The Democrats in Iowa get that it's not easy to win these elections, and that to win in states like ours you have to get some independent votes.\"\n\nNo Republican has carried Minnesota in a presidential election since Richard Nixon in 1972, but Trump came unexpectedly close. Hillary Clinton carried the Land of 10,000 Lakes with less than 47 percent, besting Trump by 1.5 percentage points, or about 44,000 votes. \"It was Hillary's smallest margin, and in fact she got a lower percentage of the vote than she did in four states she lost, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and Michigan,\" said Klobuchar. \"Then I think she won only because some of the moderate Republicans voted for [Libertarian Gary] Johnson because, as you know, they like that name.\"\n\nThis is a joke Minnesotans will get. The state is chock-full of people with the surname Johnson. They're everywhere.\n\n-- Klobuchar won her third term in November with 60 percent of the vote, beating her GOP challenger by 24 points, or 626,000 votes. Klobuchar won 42 counties in 2018 that Trump had won in 2016. Of those, 39 are in rural areas. (Minnesota has 87 counties.) Riding her coattails, Democrats flipped the state House and picked up two U.S. House seats in the suburbs of the Twin Cities that have long been held by Republicans. Klobuchar has consistently fared well in outlying areas. She's carried all eight of Minnesota's congressional districts in all three of her Senate campaigns, including the one previously represented by Republican Michele Bachmann.\n\n\"I visit every county every year in Minnesota, and that's one of my things: I go not just where it's comfortable but where it's uncomfortable,\" she said. \"That means people are going to ask critical questions here and there when they don't agree with something, but then they're going to find some common ground. That's what I've been doing here in Iowa.\"\n\nKlobuchar added that she's not putting all her eggs in the Iowa basket. She also hired staffers in New Hampshire and campaigned in Nevada last weekend.\n\n-- Klobuchar was in the national spotlight yesterday during Bill Barr's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss Bob Mueller's report. She pressed the attorney general on his conclusion that the president didn't obstruct justice. She walked through the 10 episodes of possible obstruction in the Mueller report. \"You look at the totality of the evidence,\" Klobuchar said. \"That's what I learned when I was in law school.\" Barr replied, \"There's ample evidence on the other side of the ledger.\"\n\nKlobuchar was one of three presidential candidates to question Barr, in addition to Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey. She said after the hearing that Barr should resign. \"I've always thought that he should step down,\" Klobuchar explained. \"I never supported him to begin with, and everything that's happened has been consistent with my views that I put forth back during his confirmation hearing, that his expansive view of executive power was the worst thing the country needs right now when we have a president that needs a check and balance, and that is more true in how he handled this report and his statements today.\"\n\n-- Klobuchar also used the hearing to criticize the White House's maneuvering to quash the Secure Elections Act during the last Congress, which she co-sponsored with Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) and which would mandate backup paper ballots. Klobuchar said that former White House counsel Don McGahn called around to GOP senators to get them to oppose the measure and asked Barr whether he'll back her plan when she reintroduces it. \"Otherwise, we are not going to have any clout to get backup paper ballots if something goes wrong in this election,\" the senator said. Barr responded that he does not know about the bill, but he pledged to work with her \"on securing our elections.\"\n\n-- In Iowa, Klobuchar has been touting her commitment to bipartisanship, but she said she doesn't consider herself a moderate. \"People can call me whatever they want, as long as they call me a winner,\" she said. \"I don't really care, but I think it's important to note that I'm a proven progressive and that I've gotten things done.\"\n\nThe senator has been willing to say \"no\" to some of the purity tests being pushed by far-left activists, which has been a rare quality in this environment. Klobuchar has expressed skepticism of packing the Supreme Court, for example, and she's said that her rivals promising free tuition to universities and college debt forgiveness aren't being straight with voters. On health care, Klobuchar endorses a public option but stops short of Medicare-for-all.\n\n-- A big part of Klobuchar's theory of the case is that she can bridge the urban-rural divide that has bedeviled Democrats lately. \"Yeah, I'm going to reach out to our base, and I know I'm in an incredibly competitive primary, but it's just not me if I don't also try to bridge that divide with rural voters,\" she said.\n\nShe rolled out a trillion-dollar infrastructure proposal during a March swing across rural eastern Iowa. \"There's no such thing as a Democratic or Republican bridge,\" she said. \"There are just bridges.\"\n\nKlobuchar said showing up is important, but it's also important to lay out an optimistic economic agenda and not get distracted by divisive cultural issues when Trump talks about them. Klobuchar also tries to use humor. When she announced her candidacy outdoors as it was snowing, Trump called her a \"snow woman\" on Twitter. Klobuchar replied: \"I'd like to see how your hair would fare in a blizzard.\"\n\n-- Klobuchar said she thinks the televised town halls by the cable channels this year will wind up being equally as important as the debates, which will be split across two nights and where the massive numbers of candidates on the stage will make it hard for anyone to get a word in edgewise. Fox News will broadcast an hour-long town hall with Klobuchar live from Milwaukee on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. Eastern. Sanders is the only other Democrat who has gotten the platform thus far, and 2.6 million people tuned in. Pete Buttigieg, who appears on the cover of next week's Time magazine, has a Fox town hall on the books for May 19.\n\n-- Klobuchar works very hard to cultivate a brand as down-home and down-to-earth. \"The Senator Next Door\" was the title of her 2015 memoir. But she's also indisputably one of the smartest candidates running to be president. She went to Yale for undergrad, where she wrote an astute senior thesis on the politics behind the public financing of the Metrodome stadium. It was published as a book in 1986 and holds up well three decades later. Then she went to the University of Chicago for law school, where Jim Comey was a classmate.\n\n-- Klobuchar was the first woman elected to the Senate from Minnesota. The state still hasn't elected a woman as governor. I've encountered a surprisingly significant number of female voters at Democratic events recently, including town halls for female presidential candidates, who have volunteered without any prompting during interviews that they're not sure whether it makes sense to nominate another woman to take on Trump after Clinton's defeat. I asked Klobuchar about this dynamic and, more broadly, whether she feels she's experienced more misogyny in rural areas than the suburbs or urban centers.\n\n\"I wouldn't call it misogyny, ever,\" the senator replied. \"I think that it is people that want to win, and they're just trying to game it out basically and figure it out. I don't agree with the assessment, but I wouldn't call it misogyny. I would say that they are so focused on beating Donald Trump, and they are trying to figure out who the best person is for that. It's that simple.\"\n\nKlobuchar noted that women won many of the most exciting victories for Democrats in the midterms in red states with large rural populations. She pointed out that Laura Kelly defeated Kris Kobach in the Kansas governor's race. Democratic women also picked up two of Iowa's four U.S. House seats in the midterms, defeating Republican incumbents in districts that Trump had carried two years earlier. Abby Finkenauer, 30, ousted Rod Blum in the northeast district that includes her hometown of Dubuque. Cindy Axne, 54, toppled David Young in the southwestern district that includes Council Bluffs.\n\n\"It's a thing. They supported a woman for president before. But the answer is right in front of them, with Cindy and Abby in their own state,\" said Klobuchar. \"You have to make the case that a woman can win and is perhaps ... actually a good bet against Donald Trump, depending on who the woman is. What I think you don't want to have be your whole theme is, 'Oh, we have to put a woman in the White House.' I don't think that's going to work for voters when they just want to win. What works is if you're able to show your strength, and you're able to show that you do well against him. We had a Michigan poll that showed Biden and I were the two strongest candidates against Trump.\"\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) announced this morning on CBS that he is running for president. He is the 21st Democrat to declare a candidacy. Michael Scherer reports: \"Bennet announced in April that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. After surgery, he reported that it had been successful and he had no need for further treatment. 'My plan is to run for president,' Bennet said on CBS, adding that he will focus on issues including health care, economic mobility and the 'need to restore integrity to our government.' Bennet emphasized his track record of bipartisan legislation in Washington and said he would stand out among Democrats because of his ability to tell the truth, his record of winning elections in a 'purple' state like Colorado and his history of turning around failing businesses in the private sector.\"\n\n-- Soon there will be 22: Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) plans to announce his White House bid during the week of May 13. The two-term governor can't run for reelection in 2020 because of term limits, and he has rejected Sen. Chuck Schumer's recruitment efforts to get him to challenge Sen. Steve Daines (R). So he's got nothing to lose. (KTVH)\n\n-- Barr dismissed Mueller's letter complaining about his handling of the special counsel's report as \"snitty\" and refused to give any ground. Devlin Barrett, Matt Zapotosky, Karoun Demirjian and Rosalind S. Helderman report: \"The attorney general parried many of the Democrats' toughest accusations and questions with avuncular answers about legal definitions and Justice Department policy, exasperating lawmakers like Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who accused Barr of 'masterful hairsplitting.' ... After the hearing ended, Justice Department officials notified the House Judiciary Committee that Barr would not appear at a planned Thursday hearing to discuss the Trump investigation. That session had been in doubt over objections by Barr's aides that he would be questioned by staff lawyers for the committee. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec blamed the cancellation on 'unprecedented and unnecessary' conditions demanded by the committee's Democratic chairman, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York.\"\n\n-- Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters after the hearing that he will not call Mueller to testify. (Watch the video.)\n\n-- Barr's refusal to appear before the House Judiciary Committee increases the likelihood he will be held in contempt of Congress, especially after the AG blew off the panel's subpoena deadline to review the unredacted Mueller report. Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian report: \"Nadler said he would give Barr a 'day or two' to turn over the full, unredacted Mueller report in accordance with the committee's subpoena -- information that was due Wednesday morning. But the chairman warned that 'if good-faith negotiations don't result in a pledge of compliance .\u2009.\u2009. the next step is seeking a contempt citation against the attorney general.' ... On Wednesday night, in a letter to the committee explaining the ignored subpoena, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd argued that Nadler's move to compel the DOJ to turn over the unredacted Mueller report 'is not legitimate oversight.'\"\n\n-- The White House said it will refuse to authorize any executive branch officials to provide a House committee with details on individual security clearances. Tom Hamburger, Rachael Bade and Josh Dawsey report: \"House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) called [the move] 'the latest example of the president's widespread and growing obstruction of Congress.' The oversight panel has been examining the administration's handling of security clearances and allegations that officials, including presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner, were granted access to sensitive information over the objections of career staffers. ... On Wednesday, White House Counsel Pat A. Cipollone escalated the fight, writing to Cummings that his 'committee appears to be putting public servants at risk' as it seeks information on how the White House granted security clearances to Kushner and others in the White House. Cummings rejected Cipollone's arguments and accused the administration of taking on the trappings of monarchy.\"\n\n-- House Democrats denounced Trump's lawsuit to block compliance with a subpoena for his financial records as a grave threat to congressional oversight. Spencer S. Hsu reports: \"In a 34-page answer to the lawsuit, filed April 22 by Trump against [Cummings] and Trump's accounting firm, lawyers for Cummings urged a federal judge to reject the president's request to temporarily block the subpoena while the case proceeds. Ruling for Trump 'would directly impede ongoing congressional investigations of national importance and threaten the constitutional system that separates and divides power between the branches of government,' lawyers for the House panel wrote.\"\n\n-- Mar-a-Lago sent the federal government a $1,000 bill in April 2017 after a group of White House staffers served themselves top-shelf liquor from the resort's bar. ProPublica's Derek Kravitz has a very important story based on documents obtained via an open records lawsuit. \"The group asked the bartender to leave the room so it 'could speak confidentially,' according to an email written by Mar-a-Lago's catering director, Brooke Watson. The Secret Service guarded the door, according to the email. The bartender wasn't allowed to return. And members of the group began pouring themselves drinks. No one paid. Six days later, on April 13, Mar-a-Lago created a bill for those drinks, tallying $838 worth of alcohol plus a 20% service charge. ... The unusual cocktail hour underscores a unique push and pull in the current administration: Donald Trump's White House pays a bill and Donald Trump's club reaps the revenue. ... Emails show that the president's company refused to agree to what was essentially a bulk-purchase agreement with the federal government, and that it charged the maximum allowable federal rate for hotel rooms.\" The White House, the State Department and the Trump Organization all declined to comment.\n\n-- Has Trump found his new Roy Cohn? By aggressively downplaying the president's efforts to get former White House counsel Don McGahn to remove Mueller, Barr often looked more like Trump's defense attorney than the nation's chief law enforcement officer. Carol Leonnig reports: \"In Barr's telling ... Trump may have merely been trying to correct media reports he believed were inaccurate. He cited the president's public explanations of his behavior -- even though the president refused to provide testimony about it under oath. And he discounted as weak the case that Trump's actions were part of a criminal effort to thwart a federal investigation -- despite the fact that Mueller said in his report that 'substantial evidence' indicated the president was acting to prevent scrutiny of his conduct in the obstruction inquiry. ... In a day of sometimes prickly testimony, the focus on Barr's view of the McGahn episode provided the most revealing look yet at Barr's rationale for determining there was not sufficient evidence to charge Trump with trying to thwart the probe.\"\n\n-- Barr's hearing underscored how Mueller's by-the-book silence has enabled Trump and his allies to cast the probe's findings in the most favorable light possible for the president. Greg Miller explains: \"In particular, the attorney general downplayed or dismissed the evidence assembled by Mueller that Trump could be guilty of obstructing justice. And he emphasized that Mueller found no proof of collusion between Russia and Trump or his associates. ... Mueller's reverence for the rule of law and rigid adherence to protocol have bolstered the credibility of the Russia report. ... But the special counsel's deference to procedure and bureaucratic authority has also enabled Trump and his allies to dominate the debate over the investigation's results.\"\n\n-- Former FBI director Jim Comey argues in a stinging op-ed that Barr, as well as outgoing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, have been co-opted by Trump's \"amoral\" leadership. Comey writes in the New York Times: \"Amoral leaders have a way of revealing the character of those around them. Sometimes what they reveal is inspiring. ... But more often, proximity to an amoral leader reveals something depressing. I think that's at least part of what we've seen with Bill Barr and Rod Rosenstein. Accomplished people lacking inner strength can't resist the compromises necessary to survive Mr. Trump and that adds up to something they will never recover from. It takes character like [former defense secretary Jim] Mattis's to avoid the damage, because Mr. Trump eats your soul in small bites.\"\n\n-- Comey agreed to appear in a CNN town hall on May 9, the two-year anniversary of his firing. (CNN)\n\n-- How the hearing is playing:\n\n-- Hillary Clinton suggested hypothetically that, if the Justice Department was going to let Russia interference in the 2016 election go unpunished, China should get Trump's tax returns to help the 2020 Democratic nominee. Politico's Bianca Quilantan reports: \"The 2016 Democratic presidential candidate offered a seemingly tongue-in-cheek hypothetical to Rachel Maddow on her MSNBC show. ... 'Why should Russia have all the fun? And since Russia is clearly backing Republicans, why don't we ask China to back us? ... And not only that, China, if you're listening, why don't you get Trump's tax returns?' Clinton [said]. 'I'm sure our media would richly reward you.'\"\n\nTHE GROWING CHINA THREAT:\n\n-- Former CIA case officer Jerry Lee pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiring to commit espionage for China. But Lee's sentence will likely be significantly shorter than previously expected because the guilty plea he entered describes the information he divulged as \"secret\" rather than \"top secret,\" even though U.S. intelligence officials still believe the former agent is responsible for compromising and betraying CIA sources in China. (Rachel Weiner and Shane Harris)\n\n-- Chinese authorities are compiling a database tracking the locations of their citizens, their mobile app usage, religious habits and even their electricity consumption. It's all part of a crackdown on an estimated 1 million Muslim citizens. Gerry Shih has an alarming report: \"In the last two years, a growing body of testimony by former Xinjiang residents and a trove of government procurement documents, directives and state media reports have painted a picture of oppression in the region, where Chinese authorities have relied on far-reaching electronic surveillance to help dictate its mass internment program. ... After denying their existence for a year, Chinese authorities have recently argued that Xinjiang's network of detention centers are built for educating and de-radicalizing a Muslim population that became increasingly influenced by extremist Islamic ideology.\"\n\n-- A federal judge in Washington ordered three Chinese banks partly or wholly owned by the government to turn over documents as part of a probe into the evasion of sanctions on North Korea. Spencer S. Hsu reports: \"A March 18 opinion unsealed late Tuesday by Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell marked the first known instance in which a U.S. court has upheld subpoenas to a Chinese bank in a sanctions probe. ... Records capturing 'cash deposits .\u2009.\u2009. intrabank transfers and foreign currency deposits' that can be used to launder money through the United States 'are precisely the type that the statute permits the government to subpoena,' wrote Howell.\"\n\n-- British Prime Minister Theresa May has just fired her defense secretary after he allegedly played a role in leaking details from a meeting about Britain's ties to the Chinese tech giant Huawei. Karla Adam and William Booth report: \"The abrupt sacking of Britain's top defense official -- over allegations by the prime minister that [Gavin] Williamson had breached the secrecy protocols of the National Security Council -- was stunning. For a top government minister to be canned over such a leak is almost unprecedented in Britain. Williamson denied any involvement in the unauthorized disclosure. ... After an April 23 meeting of Britain's National Security Council, attended by intelligence chiefs and senior cabinet ministers, a story appeared on the front page of the Daily Telegraph that claimed May had decided to permit Huawei to play a leading role in building Britain's 5G Internet -- despite intense pressure from the United States to ban Huawei as a security risk.\"\n\n-- China has dubiously declared itself a \"near-Arctic power\" in a bid to encroach on what's long been an American sphere of influence. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps promise to push back with a show of force. The Wall Street Journal's Ben Kesling reports: \"Navy Secretary Richard Spencer said the service would undertake extensive Arctic operations this summer and fall, while the Marine Corps commandant said that Marines are committed to training in Alaska to an extent not seen in decades. ... As the Arctic opens up to greater navigation [because of climate change], major powers are vying for supremacy over areas previously locked under ice.\"\n\n-- A Chinese family allegedly paid $6.5 million to secure their daughter's admission to Stanford as part of the college admissions fraud scandal. The family of Yusi Zhao, a Chinese national who was admitted to Stanford as a sailing recruit even though there are no indications she ever sailed, met Rick Singer through a Morgan Stanley financial adviser. Her family has not yet been charged in the case and denies wrongdoing, but she has been expelled by Stanford. (Los Angeles Times)\n\n-- Some American politicians appear unwilling to acknowledge the Chinese threat. Joe Biden even said in Iowa last night that China is \"not competition for us.\" Felicia Sonmez reports: \"At a campaign stop in Iowa City, Biden pointed to his years serving as vice president and as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, telling the crowd that there's not a 'single solitary' world leader who would trade the problems the United States faces for those confronting China. 'China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man,' said Biden ... His comments drew a swift rebuke from Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), the GOP's 2012 presidential nominee. 'This will not age well,' Romney said.\"\n\nMORE ON THE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Thousands of demonstrators showed up to support Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the opposition tried to regain momentum in the campaign to oust President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Anthony Faiola, Mariana Zu\u00f1iga and Mary Beth Sheridan report: \"Yet the chaotic events of the day before -- which began with Guaid\u00f3's calling for a peaceful insurrection by the military and ended with few takers and Maduro still in the presidential palace -- left opposition supporters grappling with a sense of a pivotal moment lost. Many in the ranks remained resolute after a day of violence that left one man dead, dozens injured and more detained. But there were also strains of confusion and disappointment. ... Senior opposition leaders spent part of the day Wednesday explaining their tactics to others in the movement, many of whom had been left in the dark about Guaid\u00f3's high-stakes bid ... Guaid\u00f3 and the Trump administration had hoped this week would be a turning point in the three-month-long effort to remove Maduro.\"\n\n-- But the opposition's plan seems to have failed, for now. Karen DeYoung, Josh Dawsey and Paul Sonne report: \"The Trump administration publicly blamed Russia and Cuba -- Maduro's top backers -- for keeping him in place and discouraging expected high-level defections. On Wednesday, as the United States and Russia traded barbs, the White House held an emergency meeting of top national security aides to mull next steps. 'Significant progress on defense matters' was made, a senior administration official said. Throughout the day, however, there were mixed messages about what role, if any, the U.S. military would play in Washington's future efforts to resolve the Venezuelan crisis.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, thinks national security adviser John Bolton \"wants to get him into wars.\" From Karen, Josh and Paul: \"Bolton has angered some within and outside the White House. Even before Tuesday's events, his staff clashed with Gen. Paul Selva, Dunford's vice chairman, during a meeting to address the ongoing Venezuelan crisis, according to several officials with knowledge of the exchange. The soft-spoken Air Force general was giving an update last week on the Pentagon's view and making the case against a risky escalation by the United States when Bolton aides, including Mauricio Claver-Carone, Western Hemisphere director at the National Security Council, repeatedly interrupted and asked for military options, according to the officials. Selva, irritated at the interruptions and confrontational style rather than the substance of any disagreement, slammed his hand down on the table, his ring hitting the wood with a sharp crack. Bolton deputy Charles Kupperman, who was chairing the meeting, adjourned the session earlier than planned, said the officials, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\"\n\n-- About 50 Americans have been living inside the Venezuelan Embassy in D.C. for three weeks, and now, Venezuelan demonstrators say they want the embassy back. Marissa J. Lang reports: \"On one side, a group of activists from Code Pink and other left-wing organizations have been living inside the embassy since April 10 at the invitation of the Maduro government. On Tuesday, they sat on the embassy steps and sang American protest songs, holding yellow signs that read 'No to U.S. coup plots' and 'Hands off Venezuela!' On the other side of the barricades, pro-opposition demonstrators decked out in yellow, red and blue filled the streets. They chanted, 'libertad,' meaning 'freedom,' and sang the Venezuelan national anthem.\"\n\n-- Trump and his administration are trying to salvage support for his NAFTA rewrite, which has received bipartisan blowback. Erica Werner and Damian Paletta report: \"White House officials have said that Trump really wants the Canada-Mexico trade deal to be successful and that he knows he needs support from Democrats to achieve this. ... Trump's new courtship of Democrats on trade came as he is simultaneously trying to prevent Republicans from bolting. A number of Republicans have objected to Trump's hardball tactics in the trade talks and want him to start offering Canada and Mexico immediate concessions. ... White House officials have signaled they want the Canada-Mexico trade deal to be completed by the end of this year, before election-year politics overwhelm Washington in 2020.\"\n\nMORE ON 2020:\n\n-- Biden is facing mounting conflict of interest questions that are being promoted by Trump and his allies over the ousting of a Ukrainian prosecutor general he once said was corrupt -- and who had opened a case into a company that was paying Hunter Biden. The New York Times's Ken Vogel and Iuliia Mendel report: \"The broad outlines of how the Bidens' roles intersected in Ukraine have been known for some time. The former vice president's campaign said that he had always acted to carry out United States policy without regard to any activities of his son, that he had never discussed the matter with Hunter Biden and that he learned of his son's role with the Ukrainian energy company from news reports. But new details about Hunter Biden's involvement, and a decision this year by the current Ukrainian prosecutor general to reverse himself and reopen an investigation into Burisma, have pushed the issue back into the spotlight just as the senior Mr. Biden is beginning his 2020 presidential campaign.\"\n\n-- Biden has already benefited from the extensive donor network that Obama built during his two presidential elections. Hours after launching his campaign last week, the former vice president raised about $700,000 from a fundraiser held at a Comcast executive's Philadelphia home. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \"But his approach also serves as a test of whether Democratic voters, wary of the political influence of wealthy corporate interests, will be turned off by a candidate so openly courting big donors. Most of the other Democratic hopefuls have focused on attracting large numbers of smaller contributions from online donors. ... Biden's connections to wealthy donors could also place pressure on other Democrats to step up their big-money fundraising.\"\n\n-- Biden wants Trump to know that he's no socialist. Matt Viser reports: \"Biden's implicit argument to Democrats, in the meantime, is that he has embraced enough of the policies animating the party's ascendant left to make him acceptable as the standard-bearer -- but not enough to alienate the working-class voters the party desperately wants to win back in 2020. He has embraced raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, a posture that advances on Hillary Clinton's stutter-step approach to raising wages in 2016, and he has touted a plan to allow anyone to go to community college free. He also has spurned others, calling for improvements to the Affordable Care Act but declining to back a Medicare-for-all plan supported by many of his party's 2020 candidates.\"\n\n-- Biden said last night that Barr should resign, saying he's \"lost confidence\" in the attorney general. \"This is what happens when you get caught in this administration -- you get pulled down,\" Biden said. (KCCI)\n\n-- Biden also called for the U.S. to end its support to Saudi Arabia in its war in Yemen. Josh Rogin reports: \"Biden's decision to weigh in on the Yemen issue is a clear sign he plans to rely on his long experience and record on foreign policy as he lays his claim to the role of commander in chief. That means foreign policy will indeed be featured in the Democratic primary, something Biden's opponents within the party are already preparing for.\"\n\n-- Kamala Harris and Cory Booker are trying to become the consensus pick for African American voters by pitching two very different economic visions. The New York Times's Nick Corasaniti and Astead W. Herndon report: \"Mr. Booker's 'baby bonds' proposal calls for every child born in the United States to be given a $1,000 savings account that the government would fund annually on a tiered basis, depending on family income. The lump sum is presented when the child turns 18 and can only be used for education, investing in a business or buying a home. ... Ms. Harris's policy, called LIFT the Middle Class Act, would provide lower-income families up to $500 in monthly payments, on top of existing tax credits and public benefits.\"\n\n-- Reversing himself under pressure, Beto O'Rourke said he will take no donations from the fossil fuel sector. Any funds he raised from that sector that are over $200 will be returned. Texas is a big energy state, and O'Rourke has sometimes been an ally of the industry. (AP)\n\n-- Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.) won't challenge Sen. John Cornyn (R) for his Senate seat. The Texas Tribune's Abby Livingston and Patrick Svitek report: \"After repeated public signals that he was 'all but certain' to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, Castro, a San Antonio Democrat, has opted to run for reelection rather than pursue what would likely have been a bruising political battle. ... But Castro's decision first came to light earlier in the day, when he told a reporter that he's 'gonna pass' on the race to unseat Cornyn. That conversation with Castro was overheard by other media outlets on Cornyn's weekly conference call with the Texas media. The reporter apparently had not muted his line on the Cornyn call and was talking with Castro on a different line.\"\n\nTHE IMMIGRATION WARS ESCALATE:\n\n-- The White House sent Congress a $4.5 billion emergency spending request for border protection money. Erica Werner, Maria Sacchetti and Nick Miroff report: \"The request includes $3.3 billion for humanitarian assistance and $1.1 billion for border operations, and it represents a dramatic escalation of the administration's efforts to address the situation at the border. ... 'The situation becomes more dire each day,' White House acting budget director Russ Vought wrote in the request to congressional leaders. 'The migration flow and the resulting humanitarian crisis is rapidly overwhelming the ability of the Federal Government to respond.' ... Democrats responded with skepticism to the request, which comes as Trump prepares to run for reelection on a hard-line immigration agenda. It also arrives as Congress is in the midst of a fight over a different emergency spending bill, for disaster aid.\"\n\n-- In its plea for funds, the administration described migrants as vulnerable children and families requiring resources to \"sustain critical and lifesaving missions,\" a message that starkly conflicts with Trump's typical description of those seeking to immigrate as an \"invasion\" by criminals and gang members. David Nakamura reports: \"The sharp dichotomy between the president's rhetoric and the tone of his aides reflects how they are waging a battle on separate fronts -- one political and the other operational -- as the administration struggles to deal with a mounting humanitarian crisis at the U.S. border with Mexico.\"\n\n-- The U.S. immigration court system is facing a backlog of 850,000 cases with fewer than 450 judges nationwide to handle them. Nick Miroff and Maria Sacchetti report: \"Since Trump took office, the backlog has swelled by more than 200,000 cases. The president has grown so frustrated that he has been floating the idea of doing away with U.S. immigration courts, which are part of the Justice Department, not the judicial branch. 'We don't need a court system,' he told Fox Business Network anchor Maria Bartiromo this week. 'We have a court system that is -- has 900,000 cases behind it. In other words, they have a court which needs to hear 900,000 cases. How ridiculous is this?' He added, 'What we need is new laws that don't allow this, so when somebody comes in, we say: 'Sorry, you got to go out.'\"\n\n-- A 16-year-old Guatemalan boy who crossed the border without his parents died after spending several days at a Texas hospital. Maria Sacchetti reports: \"The teenager, who was not identified, had cleared initial health screenings after encountering U.S. officials at the border. But he deteriorated shortly after he arrived at the Casa Padre shelter, a converted Walmart housing approximately 1,400 minors in the border city of Brownsville, Tex. Officials have not released a cause of death, and the case remains under investigation. ... The boy was the third migrant child to die in federal custody in the past five months, as a soaring number of Central American families and unaccompanied minors have been trying to enter the United States via the southern border.\"\n\n-- Trump appears to think that his best hope for reelection is to once again make the race a referendum on the border, which inspired his proposals to radically overhaul asylum rules. Sean Sullivan, Josh Dawsey and Matt Viser report: \"Trump has repeatedly told White House aides that he won in 2016 because he was the strongest candidate on immigration -- and that no chant at his rallies is louder than 'Build the wall!' When he is underscoring his immigration stance and contrasting it with Democrats, current and former aides and associates said, Trump thinks he has the advantage.\"\n\nTHE REST OF TRUMP'S DOMESTIC AGENDA:\n\n-- The Trump administration may seek permanent renewal of the surveillance law that has allowed the NSA to gather and analyze Americans' phone records. Ellen Nakashima reports: \"The White House, these officials said, was prepared to issue a public statement calling on Congress to reauthorize in full Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which in the past has been the focus of heated debate over the acceptable bounds of government surveillance. The plan to issue a statement was put on hold, officials said, but it illustrates nonetheless where the administration stands on the contested issue of national security authority. ... The statute expires in mid-December, and the reported suspension of the phone records program had raised questions about whether the Trump administration would seek to renew it.\"\n\n-- DOJ offered its first full argument in court for fully invalidating the Affordable Care Act. CNN's Ariane de Vogue reports: \"The government argues in the filings that the so-called 'individual mandate' requiring Americans to have coverage is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law should therefore also be struck down, even if the government 'might support some individual provisions as a policy matter.' ... In the filing, Assistant Attorney General Joseph Hunt acknowledged that the administration had previously argued that parts of the law could remain in effect even if the individual mandate were struck down, but he said, the administration had come to believe it could no longer defend that position.\"\n\n-- Senior Republicans, including the Senate majority whip, acknowledged that Stephen Moore appears unlikely to win confirmation to the Federal Reserve Board. Seung Min Kim reports: \"Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) has already said she probably would oppose him, while several other GOP senators have expressed concerns and have privately indicated they prefer he never be officially nominated. Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said in an interview Wednesday that he expects more information about Moore's fate by the end of the week and that trying to confirm him in the Senate, where Republicans control 53 votes, would be a 'very heavy lift.' ... Two GOP senators familiar with party dynamics ... said they expect either Moore to withdraw or the White House to cancel his pending nomination by either Thursday or Friday.\"\n\n-- A new Senate GOP offer on the disaster aid bill would send $300 million more to Puerto Rico in an attempt to break a standoff. Erica Werner reports: \"A key Democrat reacted positively Wednesday, in an optimistic sign for prospects for a deal. But White House officials were still reviewing the proposal, and President Trump, who has resisted sending more money to Puerto Rico, had yet to endorse it. ... Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said of the new proposal: 'I'm hopeful. It deals with additional resources to Puerto Rico, it deals with making sure the money doesn't get wasted.'\"\n\nOne of Barr's predecessors accused him of trying to protect Trump:\n\nThe Senate's Democratic whip raised this concern about the attorney general:\n\nAnother Democratic senator added this Nixon comparison:\n\nFrom a Mueller biographer:\n\nA Cond\u00e9 Nast editor tweeted a photo of Mueller's military days:\n\nA New York Times columnist scrutinized this answer from Barr:\n\nFrom a University of Alabama law professor and a former U.S. attorney:\n\nFrom a CNN reporter:\n\nHillary's former spokesman, who is now at the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, mocked the questions posed to Barr by GOP senators:\n\nA political science professor at the University of Denver pushed back against Trump's claims of presidential harassment:\n\nFox News host Chris Wallace said Mueller's letter shouldn't be underestimated:\n\nA Fox colleague fired back:\n\nThe schedule for an iconic Iowa caucus event is set:\n\nA Republican congressman running for Alabama's Senate seat criticized Biden for his comments on China:\n\nMitt Romney, who was mercilessly mocked in 2012 by Biden for saying Russia was the biggest geopolitical threat facing the U.S., piled on:\n\nA BuzzFeed News reporter tweeted a photo of this bizarre Biden sign in Iowa:\n\nHillary Clinton ran into a fan:\n\nAnd Elizabeth Warren celebrated her golden retriever's birthday:\n\nGOOD READS FROM ELSEWHERE:\n\n-- BuzzFeed News, \"A Former Alt-Right Member's Message: Get Out While You Still Can,\" by Rosie Gray: \"If you remember Katie McHugh, it's probably because of the tweets. ... There are many ... examples, but this is the big one, the one that ultimately triggered her firing from her job as a writer and editor at Breitbart News in 2017: 'There would be no deadly terror attacks in the U.K. if Muslims didn't live there.' If you look at her Twitter feed now, you'll see that it's changed. It's locked, and her bio is blank. Where is McHugh? I can't tell you, but I've seen her lately. The first time we met was late last summer, on the stoop of a house where she was then living in Washington, DC. She looked gaunt and anxious. When I shook her hand it felt tiny and frail. We sat facing each other across a patio table on a hot, sticky day. ... She was saying she wanted to leave it all behind: her years as a far-right media figure and tweeter, and someone whom close observers of right-wing media knew was one of Breitbart's most obvious connections to the white supremacist core of the alt-right.\"\n\n-- The New Yorker, \"How the Census Changed America,\" by Ted Widmer: \"The 1890 Census was simply too big to bind; it was five times larger than all the previous censuses combined. ... The chief clerk of the census predicted that it would require a seven-thousand-foot shelf to store them all. Finding more than a mile of empty shelf space was difficult, even in a city that was already known for its bureaucracy. So the pile sat around, sparking no joy among the officials charged with its safekeeping. ... The papers were arranged on narrow pine shelves, in cardboard packages wrapped with twine. ... The space was also very hot -- more than ninety degrees when the boiler was running. On the afternoon of January 10, 1921, an employee noticed smoke coming through openings around the pipes that ran from the boiler room into the file room. ... The greatest effort in history to tell a nation's story had gone up in a puff of smoke. ... The idea of a National Archives ... emerged in response to the disaster.\"\n\n-- Bloomberg Businessweek, \"The Most Valuable Company (for Now) Is Having a Nadellaissance,\" by Austin Carr and Dina Bass: \"Even if it doesn't last, [Satya] Nadella's turnaround over the five years since he replaced Steve Ballmer as CEO [of Microsoft] has been nothing short of historic. The company had been universally viewed as spiraling toward obsolescence, having missed almost every significant computing trend of the 2000s -- mobile phones, search engines, social networking -- while letting its main source of revenue, Windows, the operating system that comes preloaded on PCs, stagnate. Microsoft marketers like to attribute its reemergence as a tech power to a sort of cultural rehab, involving what Nadella calls corporate 'empathy' and a shift of his team from a 'fixed mindset' to a 'growth mindset.' The reality of the company's turnaround was more painful, according to interviews with more than four dozen current and former executives, board members, customers, and competitors.\"\n\nTrump and the first lady will participate in a National Day of Prayer service and later meet with Republican senators.\n\n-- It'll be a partly sunny day with chances of an afternoon storm.

Europe's General Data Protection Regulation went into effect almost a year ago, and the outcomes of these investigations will reveal whether the new rules have teeth.\n\n\"We have reason to believe then clearly that there are potential infringements of the GDPR arising,\" Dixon said at the hearing. \"We are significantly advanced in a number of those investigations and intend to bring a decision and an outcome on those investigations.\"\n\nThe sheer number of probes highlights how the European regulators are increasingly emerging as the de facto top cop of American tech companies -- when there are still divisions in Congress over what a federal privacy law should encompass in the U.S.\n\nIreland's commission hasn't yet brought any fines against U.S. tech firms under the new European regulatory regime -- but any penalties it pursues could be as much as 4 percent of a company's annual worldwide revenue.\n\nIreland is charged with overseeing the enforcement of GDPR when it comes to most technology companies because many have their European headquarters in the country. Dixon testified that Internet platforms are among the top sources of complaints to the commission. Other sectors that receive the most complaints include banking and telecommunications.\n\nAs the one-year mark of GDPR looms, the country's role in enforcing the law has come under scrutiny as critics wonder why the commission has not yet brought fines against any companies. Dixon told yesterday's panel it's taking time because the \"sanctions are significant\" and the commission needs to give companies the opportunity to respond at various steps in the process.\n\nStill, their relative organization is striking since there has been little motion in Washington toward achieving a privacy bill. Lawmakers remain divided over issues including whether individuals should be able to sue companies over perceived privacy violations and how much authority to grant to the Federal Trade Commission to to penalize companies that violate consumers' privacy.\n\nAnd Democrats want to ensure that a federal bill would not water down or pre-empt strong state privacy laws, such as the one in California slated to take effect next year. During yesterday's panel, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said every American's privacy rights should be just as strong as residents of California. The consumer advocates on the panel agreed that law should be viewed as a floor -- not a ceiling -- for any legislation Congress considers.\n\nStill, many in Big Tech say they are on board with some kind of rules -- signaling the pressure the companies are under to show they're taking consumer privacy seriously. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, have been calling on the United States to adopt federal privacy legislation similar to the GDPR. The technology industry is warming up to the European regime and even prefers it to a federal law that takes after California's privacy bill, or an outcome where it would need to navigate a patchwork of state rules.\n\nRepublicans have also raised concerns that a patchwork of different state privacy laws could be a compliance nightmare for the companies and hinder innovation.\n\nAnd the U.S. will also face a test for the enforcement of its own existing rules soon. Federal Trade Commission is in negotiations with Facebook over a multi-billion dollar fine that would settle the agency's probe into Facebook's privacy practices. After Wall Street shrugged off Facebook's announcement it was setting aside billions for such a fine last week, many critics said it's time for the U.S. to get tougher and consider stronger remedies when tech giants violate consumers' privacy.\n\nBITS: The rise of foreign money rushing into venture capital funds and startups has transformed Silicon Valley into a \"geopolitical minefield,\" Recode's Theodore Schleifer reports.

The steps would be in addition to a multi-billion dollar fine.\n\nThe steps could include appointing a federally-approved privacy official and creating an independent privacy oversight board. Also, Mark Zuckerberg could be required to take on the role of \"designated compliance officer,\" which would make him personally accountable for the steps the company takes on privacy.\n\nAs Politico notes, the negotiations are ongoing, and the deal terms are subject to change.\n\n\"While talk of a multibillion-dollar fine against Facebook has grabbed headlines, the question of structural changes looms as a much more meaningful issue for the company, which has amassed a market value of more than $500 billion through its command of detailed data on 2.4 billion users worldwide,\" Nancy wrote. \"Wall Street has reacted with a collective shrug to reports of the fine given Facebook's financial resources, but mandated changes to the company's business model could have a longer-term impact.\"\n\nBut privacy advocates warned that changes to Facebook's governance structure may not go far enough.\n\n\"The additional remedies are not meaningful,\" Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told Politico. \"Creating an independent office, or an office within Facebook -- which by the way, is not independent -- does not establish new privacy obligations, nor does it ensure compliance.\"\n\nBYTES: Google announced yesterday it would begin allowing users to set a time limit for how long it stores their web brosing history or location data, CNBC's Todd Haselton reports.\n\nCurrently users need to manually opt-out of such storage by visiting Google and deciding to delete it or turn it off completely.

For a top government minister to be canned over such a leak is almost unprecedented in Britain.\n\nWilliamson denied any involvement in the unauthorized disclosure.\n\nThe British political press quickly focused on the \"Game of Thrones\" atmosphere in May's fractious government, stoked by open divisions over Brexit and by May's weak leadership.\n\nWilliamson is one of the many aspirants to replace May, who is seen as especially vulnerable over her failure to deliver a European Union exit plan.

But revelations about U.S. tech companies and their abilities to harvest user data have increased suspicions about what the Chinese could do if they were operating the switches.\n\nIn a letter to Williamson on Wednesday, May wrote that an investigation into the leaks provided \"compelling evidence suggesting your responsibility for the unauthorized disclosure.\"\n\n\"No other, credible version of events to explain this leak has been identified,\" May added.\n\nIn his reply, Williamson wrote: \"I strenuously deny that I was in any way involved in this leak and I am confident that a thorough and formal inquiry would have vindicated my position.\"\n\nWilliamson became defense secretary in late 2017, after Michael Fallon left the role following allegations of inappropriate behavior toward women.\n\nIn his previous role as chief whip, Williamson kept a tarantula on his desk called Cronus.\n\nWilliamson was replaced on Wednesday evening by Penny Mordaunt.

Williamson has denied that he was the leaker.\n\nThis crisis in British politics reflects a broader set of global security problems: Telecommunications networks, which sound boring and technical, have become a major security issue.\n\nThere is a big fight happening over Huawei.\n\nThe leak was highly embarrassing to the British government because it revealed how controversial the Huawei decision was within the government. Britain -- like other European jurisdictions -- will have to upgrade its wireless communication network to 5G speeds. Huawei has played a substantial role in building the existing network, and it is widely regarded as the market leader. However, the United States wants to limit the reach of Huawei and has been engaged in a concerted diplomatic campaign to get its allies to boot Huawei out of their national telecommunications markets. This means that U.S. allies face a difficult choice: going with Huawei and incurring the displeasure of Washington or going with other providers and possibly paying much more, as well as encountering serious technical difficulties.\n\nBritain decided informally to go ahead with Huawei, despite its strong security relationship with the United States. This decision was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, which also revealed that key cabinet members opposed the decision. The fallout from that leak is what prompted today's firing.\n\nSurveillance politics are challenging political alliances.\n\nThe reason the United States does not want Huawei to play a role in telecommunications networks is straightforward. It fears that Huawei is too closely connected to China's government and will build back doors into these networks to allow China to easily spy on the West. Washington has taken steps to force Huawei out of the U.S. market and has made strong public statements about a need to exclude it more generally.\n\nThe problem is that U.S. allies are less likely to go along with U.S. wishes than they used to be.\n\nThat is, in part, because of the United States itself: The U.S. National Security Agency has remorselessly exploited global communications networks to spy in pursuit of the U.S. national interest. While it has shared key surveillance information with U.S. allies, it has also spied on many of them. This means that some allies are less willing to listen to U.S. warnings about Chinese spying than they might otherwise be, reasoning that the United States is itself in a somewhat hypocritical position.\n\nIt is also in part because the United States and its allies have different security sensitivities and different perceptions over whether they can stop bad behavior by Huawei or other companies.\n\nAnd in part, it is because of money: Excluding Huawei might make it far more expensive to build 5G networks.\n\nGlobal networks are being weaponized.\n\nThis is just one example of a broader problem that we describe in our forthcoming article for International Security on \"weaponized interdependence.\"\n\nOver the past 25 years, the world economy has become increasingly dependent on global networks -- not only in telecommunications, but also in finance, the Internet and the supply chains that build physical products. These networks produce enormous economic efficiencies, but they can also lead to serious security vulnerabilities. Now states are beginning to insulate themselves from these insecurities in ways that have international repercussions.\n\nThis will have big consequences for the global economy, as networks shrink and governments become far more suspicious of interdependent relationships between economies. It will also lead to quarrels between allies, which have different and sometimes conflicting understandings of security threats but also find that their fates are bound together. So one country's insecurities potentially threaten the security of its partners, or one country's efforts to insulate itself have huge economic ramifications for other countries that depend on it.\n\nFinally, it is having important domestic consequences, as political decision-makers within countries begin to fight about the appropriate way to respond to challenges of economic cost and security vulnerability. Williamson's firing is just one early indication of a much broader set of problems that is likely to reshape global economic politics.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RJyuolwqbSvjEChc6R-NiW3sW6o=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PGTHTMDMGYI6TO7HDR4Y7OAFGY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4755731", "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 294437880}, {"uri": "1125435568", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-05-01", "time": "07:13:00", "dateTime": "2019-05-01T07:13:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/technology/huawei-china-communist-party.html", "title": "'Striding Across the Pacific': Huawei's Identity Problem", "body": "The Chinese telecom giant seeks acceptance in the West, but its structure and value system -- patterned after the Communist Party's -- could stand in the way.\n\nThe Huawei Technologies founder Ren Zhengfei once recommended that his senior executives watch a TV series called \"Proof of Identity.\" In that 2009 series, a Communist spy who had infiltrated the Nationalist army during China's civil war struggles for years to prove his loyalty and identity after the Communists prevail.\n\nToday, 32 years after he founded the telecom giant with $3,000 of borrowed money, Mr. Ren is struggling to prove that Huawei is a private enterprise and independent of the Chinese government.\n\nThe task is more urgent than ever. In recent months, the Trump administration has said China could use Huawei's equipment to spy on other countries, though it hasn't offered proof. Critics accuse the company of being controlled by the Chinese government. Huawei has repeatedly denied these allegations, saying it is owned by its employees and wouldn't spy on its customers.\n\nRegardless of the issues of ownership and control, which have been subjects of heated debate, Huawei's struggle stems in part from its own internal conflict. The company has been deeply influenced by Western competitors. Huawei wants to help determine the world's technological future, and Mr. Ren himself has said the company may need to adapt to get there.\n\nBut at its core, from its organizational structure to the way it builds employee loyalty, Huawei closely resembles the Chinese Communist Party itself.\n\nMr. Ren's management thinking \"will naturally carry very deep imprints of the Communist Party culture,\" according to a 2017 book, \"Will Huawei Be the Next to Fall?\" (A different version was published in English as \"The Huawei Story.\")\n\nThough effusive in tone, the book -- named after the sort of question Mr. Ren often poses to employees to inspire urgency -- offers hints of why Huawei has struggled to reconcile its global ambitions with its Chinese values. The book benefits from access, including interviews with more than 100 top executives. The lead writer, Tian Tao, a management professor, has been a friend of Mr. Ren's for two decades, and Huawei sometimes gives out copies as gifts.\n\nHuawei disputed that its internal identity contributed to its problems. Citing strong financial results, it said in a statement that \"over all, Huawei's identity is accepted by customers across most of the world.\"\n\n\"All we can do to address the issues of identity is to remain open and transparent, and we intend to do that,\" it added.\n\nHuawei isn't the first Chinese institution to grapple with how to relate with the rest of the world.\n\nSince the late 1800s, China has debated how much it should learn from the West while retaining what many people see as core Chinese values: patriotism, loyalty, collective values over individual rights. The idea is known as \"Chinese substance, Western application,\" and it calls for seeking the tools for China's economic and military revival without embracing ideas like individual rights, rule of law and transparency.\n\nThat model served China well for decades. But it falters when institutions like Huawei start reaching out to the rest of the world. Many in the West worry that Huawei doesn't share their values and that it could become an actor for an authoritarian state. It will take more than a few rounds of media interviews to overcome that mistrust.\n\nMr. Ren understands the differences between the two systems. In a September speech, he instructed the company's public relations department to highlight the Huawei values that align with the West to help reach consensus.\n\n\"We have our own value system. We don't accept the Western political value system completely,\" Mr. Ren said.\n\nStill, he added: \"Their civilization was built in thousands of years. A small company like Huawei won't be able to change it.\"\n\nJudging from the book, his speeches and other appearances, Mr. Ren is a student of Western learning. He has said he admires the American political and legal systems because they offer better protection for businesses -- not an unusual idea among China's business class. He paid I.B.M. consultants for nearly two decades to help Huawei institute American-style corporate management. To catch up with the Western competitors, he once said, Huawei needed to \"wear American shoes\" even if it meant hurting its feet.\n\n\"Only by learning from them with all our humility can we defeat them one day,\" Mr. Ren was quoted as saying in the book.\n\nStill, while Huawei is eager to learn from the West, its soul is steeped in Communist Party culture.\n\n\"In a country with little business management philosophy and experience, China's entrepreneurs had to resort to the traditional political and party culture for guidance,\" according to the book.\n\nHuawei's structure looks strikingly similar to the party's. Each is run by a senior group of seven officials, with similarities even further down the line. It calls its management training program its Central Party School, which is the name of the Communist Party institution that trains promising cadres.\n\nWhen it comes to team-building and loyalty-building, Mr. Ren turned to the party's system of self-criticism, in which cadres confess to their misdeeds. Self-criticism sessions are called \"democratic life meetings,\" just like the party's.\n\n\"This is the Chinese heritage,\" the book's authors wrote. \"Western companies will never understand it. Even if they understand, they won't be able to practice it.\"\n\nHuawei also routinely holds ceremonies for its executives, from the board down, to pledge integrity and honesty, much as the party does. Mr. Ren, a former military engineer, also infuses Huawei with a militant culture. He sometimes refers to major business deals as a \"Battle for Triangle Hill,\" a reference to a clash during the Korean War that included Chinese and American troops.\n\nThe ultimate Battle for Triangle Hill, he has said, is to surpass American rivals. His 2012 annual letter ends with the sentence, \"With lofty aspirations and esprit de corps, we are striding across the Pacific Ocean,\" referring to the lyrics of a famous song about the Chinese Army crossing the Yalu River to fight the Americans and South Koreans.\n\nHe told CNBC that he liked using military terms because they were easy to understand. \"When I can't find a better term to easily describe how business works, I use military terms,\" he said.\n\nHuawei's hard-charging corporate spirit -- known as \"wolf culture\" to outsiders and employees and as \"striving culture\" to executives -- can trace its roots to the party. When Huawei came under attack a decade ago after some employee suicides made headlines in China, Mr. Ren remarked, according to the book: \"What's wrong with striving? We learned this from the Communist Party. We'll strive for the realization of communism until the end of our lives.\"\n\nEven Mr. Ren's leadership status looks like that of Deng Xiaoping, China's former paramount leader, who started China's reform and opening period in the late 1970s. Deng gave up his titles in his later years -- though he remained chairman of the China Bridge Association -- but he held the ultimate authority in China's decision making until his death in 1997.\n\nThough Mr. Ren is Huawei's chief executive, he has said he holds no decision-making power except for vetoing proposals and removing executives from their posts. Huawei's board secretary, Jiang Xisheng, told journalists last week that Mr. Ren had limited veto power.\n\nBut within Huawei, he is clearly the paramount leader.\n\n\"One can't use one's veto and impeachment power too often. Once or twice a year would suffice,\" he was quoted as saying in the book. \"Nuclear deterrence only works when the bomb remains unexploded.\"\n\nHuawei's pledge to remain open isn't likely to be enough to win over those put off by its culture. To win trust in the West, Huawei may have to change its DNA.\n\nThe same goes with China. When value systems are incompatible, and the two sides see each other as existential threats, it will be hard to find solutions.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "li_yuan@nytimes.com", "name": "Li Yuan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/01/business/01NewWorld-illo/058202cb64f445f690505212ff7b1586-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4755731", "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 294390780}, {"uri": "1125206221", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-30", "time": "22:24:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-30T22:24:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/us/politics/china-trade-data-technology.html", "title": "As Trade Talks Continue, China Is Unlikely to Yield on Control of Data", "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump began his trade war with China out of concern that Beijing was using unfair economic practices to prevent the United States from dominating next-generation technologies like autonomous vehicles, advanced telecommunications and artificial intelligence.\n\nBut as the two countries move closer to a trade deal, it seems increasingly unlikely that China will give ground in a crucial area that could determine which country wins the technology race. Despite months of pressure from the White House, Chinese negotiators have so far refused to relax tight regulations that block multinational companies from moving data they gather on their Chinese customers' purchases, habits and whereabouts out of the country. Such data is crucial as industries build next-generation technologies.\n\nWith another round of trade talks underway this week, the United States and China appear headed toward an agreement that could end the monthslong trade war and lift tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of products. China is offering to strengthen its laws surrounding intellectual property, direct large purchases of American goods and reduce barriers for foreign companies in industries like finance and agriculture. It has also proposed giving foreign cloud computing companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Apple greater ability to operate independently in China, people familiar with the negotiations say.\n\nA trade deal between the two nations will calm tensions and be seen as a victory for Mr. Trump, but some American technology companies fear the administration is giving up a valuable opportunity to press China on data-related issues and will cede too much economic power to Beijing.\n\nChina has already overseen a splintering of the world's internet, a move that has helped Chinese companies catch up to American firms. Over the past two decades, China built and shored up the Great Firewall, which blocks websites including YouTube, Facebook, Google and The New York Times from reaching more than 700 million Chinese internet users. Behind those barriers, Chinese internet companies like Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent have thrived, developing cutting-edge services that have in many respects surpassed those of their Western competitors.\n\nThe American tech industry is concerned that this same fracturing is being repeated with data, setting up more permanent divisions in how technology will be used around the world. As companies collect and analyze ever more data on customers, China has insisted that information be stored within its borders, on Chinese-made servers and routers, and not be transferred out of the country.\n\nBusiness executives say relaxing China's restrictions on data is critical to ability of the United States to build globally competitive firms in areas like autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence, which are expected to power jobs and economic growth.\n\nChina describes its data restrictions as an issue of national security, but technology firms, financial advisers, energy companies and others argue that the rules are intended to help Beijing dominate data-intensive industries. American firms say the restrictions increase their costs, force them to share sensitive technology with Chinese partners, make them more susceptible to cybertheft and leave them beholden to Chinese monitoring and censorship.\n\nTrade in data is just one of several technology issues the United States is discussing with China. Trump officials are also trying to end Beijing's pattern of forcing American companies that operate in the country to transfer valuable technology to Chinese partners, and curb cybertheft. It remains unclear how these issues will be resolved, but a final deal is expected to include changes that allow American companies in the financial and automotive industries to operate independently, rather than with a Chinese partner.\n\n\"There's no question to me that the Chinese are setting up a separate technology system, and they are a superpower in the field,\" said Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, a consulting group. \"There are some areas where they are more advanced than we are.\"\n\nThe enormous volume of email, software, audio and video content that crosses international borders each day facilitates trade in goods and services in a range of industries, including entertainment, finance, law, manufacturing and retail.\n\nIt is also allowing companies to amass troves of information on customer behavior, through monitoring purchases on Amazon, Netflix binges, GPS routing, fitness tracking and other digital services. That data, in turn, gives companies information about users' shopping habits, viewing history, driving patterns and health that is feeding the development of industries like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning and autonomous vehicles.\n\nCompanies are also gathering data about their own operations from sensors that monitor production lines in factories and alert retailers when certain products are out of stock.\n\nThis data is helping companies make and sell products in ways that are far more important to the American economy than is typically recognized, said Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center. A 2016 study by the McKinsey Global Institute found that digital flows now exert a larger impact on economic growth than trade in goods.\n\nDespite its economic importance, there are few global rules governing trade in data. Trade in goods is governed by the World Trade Organization and an extensive network of bilateral and multilateral trade deals, but no similar regulatory structure exists for data flows.\n\nThat is beginning to change. The United States has enshrined the tech industry's position in the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, which provides for open access to government data, protections for company source codes and algorithms and a prohibition on customs duties on data, among other provisions.\n\nThe agreement will serve as a jumping-off point for American trade talks with Japan, as well as negotiations on e-commerce rules with more than 70 countries at the W.T.O. Trade agreements between Europe and Japan, and between Japan and a collection of 10 other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, also have as a default the free flow of information, with some exceptions.\n\nIn other parts of the world, the tide is moving in the opposite direction, said Aaron Cooper, vice president of global policy at the Software Alliance, a trade group. In countries like India, Indonesia, Russia and Vietnam, governments are introducing regulations to ostensibly protect their citizens' privacy and build domestic internet industries that will stymie the ability of American companies to provide services in those countries.\n\nChina and the United States, home to the world's largest tech companies, are the global \"controllers of data,\" said Susan Aaronson, a professor of international affairs at George Washington University. \"There are private firms in the United States, and private firms in China that work very closely with the Chinese government.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen which country takes the lead and how rules around their data evolve. For now, both are throwing up roadblocks to thwart one another. For instance, Chinese rules prevent foreign companies from mapping the country, which could limit the ability of American companies to offer automated driving technology. American lawmakers and policymakers have tried to prevent China from monopolizing data-related infrastructure by barring Huawei and other Chinese telecom equipment firms from building any part of America's next-generation telecom network.\n\nIn the trade talks, China has offered some concessions on rules governing the cloud computing industry, where foreign companies are required to operate in tandem with a Chinese partner. In a meeting in March, China's premier, Li Keqiang, floated the idea of giving foreign cloud computing companies the ability to operate independently in a free-trade zone, as well as two of the roughly eight licenses that companies need to operate in China, people familiar with the negotiations say. In return, the Trump administration has pressed China to provide all the required licenses, and eliminate all ownership requirements without geographic restrictions.\n\nThe Chinese have also been willing to discuss setting a fairly high bar for which companies are deemed so vital to China's information infrastructure that they have to keep vast amounts of data within China using government-approved telecommunications equipment. The Chinese government has discussed applying its most stringent rules to enterprises with a market share of at least 10 percent, said one person familiar with the discussions.\n\nAmerican negotiators have called on China for more openness on its data rules, but it is not one of the Trump administration's top priorities, and China has given little ground, people familiar with the negotiations say. Even if China opens up to foreign cloud computing, continued restrictions on the flow of data from China will make these ventures less profitable. And companies say that Chinese laws on critical data could be used to curtail their operations at any time.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_swanson@nytimes.com", "name": "Ana Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/01/business/01-DIGITALTRADE-PRINT/00dc-digitaltrade-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 294359040}, {"uri": "1124792359", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-30", "time": "12:08:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-30T12:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2019/04/30/the-cybersecurity-202-here-are-the-55-things-the-u-s-government-most-needs-to-protect-against-cyberattacks/5cc7a3b01ad2e52459e246fe/", "title": "Analysis | The Cybersecurity 202: Here are the 55 things the U.S. government most needs to protect against cyberattacks", "body": "Christopher Krebs, director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is releasing today a list of 55 things the government most needs to protect from digital attacks.\n\nThe government believes that a cyberattack on any of these government or private sector services or functions could have a \"debilitating effect\" on national security, the U.S. economy or public health.\n\nOn the list, provided first to The Cybersecurity 202, are some obvious things -- such as supplying water or generating electricity. But the list also delves into some broader categories, including preserving Constitutional rights, protecting sensitive information, and enforcing the law. The list includes everything from providing internet access to supporting community health and conducting elections. You can read the full list here.\n\nThe U.S. has long relied on a system that prioritized protecting industry sectors -- such as transportation, financial services and energy -- as part of its critical infrastructure. But these broad categories are proving far too imprecise in an age when, say, North Korea launched a destructive attack on a film studio and Russia orchestrated a sweeping election inferference campaign.\n\nThe plan is part of a broader DHS effort to shift to a \"risk-based\" approach to cybersecurity -- in other words, devoting more time and money to threats that could do the most damage.\n\n\"If everything's a priority, then nothing's a priority,\" Director of DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Chris Krebs told me. \"This allows us to really drill down into those things we need to care about.\"\n\nA main benefit of the new system is that it will allow government and industry to map out how a single digital threat -- say an attack on the Global Positioning System or Internet routing services -- might ricochet across numerous industries, Krebs said.\n\nDHS's previous system for categorizing digital threats focused on 16 critical infrastructure sectors but didn't deal with the complex web of interdependence between them. And it didn't distinguish between truly vital systems, like those that deliver electricity, versus less vital ones, such as that electric utility's public-facing website.\n\n\"[Now] we can focus on ... the gaps and overlays between [industry] sectors,\" Krebs said. \"We want to back out from these artificial economic sectors into something more focused on what [industries] actually deliver at the end of the day.\"\n\nInstead of listing the healthcare sector, for example, the new critical functions list includes systems that \"maintain access to medical records\" and that \"support community health.\" And instead of transportation, it lists transporting cargo and passengers by air, rail, road, mass transit and vessels -- and materials by pipeline.\n\nThe department also plans to work with industry to identify which functions are the most critical of the critical. The department will use that prioritized list -- which it may or may not make public -- to frame conversations with industry about cybersecurity tactics and to guide DHS's budget requests to Congress, Krebs said.\n\n\"Not all [55] functions are created equal in terms of priority, so you can start triaging, putting the most critical ones at the top, figuring out where do we want to put our scarce resources,\" he said.\n\nPINGED: President Trump's lack of interest in election security and his unwillingness to condemn Russian hackers \"has made it tougher for government officials to implement a more comprehensive approach to preserving the integrity of the electoral process,\" my colleagues Josh Dawsey, Ellen Nakashima and Shane Harris report.\n\n\"For more than two years...Trump has recoiled when aides broached Russia's 2016 theft and dissemination of Democratic emails and its ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion of social media in an effort to sway the election,\" my colleagues report.\n\nDuring one 2017 meeting with advisers, Trump called the hacking operation - which the intelligence community attributed to Russia - \"a goddamn hoax,\" my colleagues reported.\n\nThe president also regularly conflates discussions about Russia's interference in the election with attacks on the legitimacy of his election, current and former officials said.\n\n\"In one meeting in late summer 2018 in the Situation Room, aides told Trump that they wanted to talk publicly to raise voters' awareness of the interference ahead of the midterm,\" my colleagues reported. \"According to an official familiar with the meeting, Trump placed a condition on any public statements: The aides must also make clear that Russia didn't influence his win.\"\n\nPATCHED: Washington doesn't believe there's any safe way to allow Huawei inside next-generation 5G wireless networks without enabling Chinese spying, the State Department's top cybersecurity diplomat Robert Strayer told reporters in Brussels on Monday, the Wall Street Journal's Parmy Olson reported.\n\nThe statement comes less than a week after the United Kingdom decided to let Huawei construct noncore portions of its 5G networks.\n\nStrayer didn't directly address the U.K. decision, the Journal reported. \"But asked about whether the U.S. and the U.K. were aligned on what constitutes vulnerable parts of a network, he said: 'no part of a 5G network should have parts or software coming from a vendor that could be under the control of an authoritarian government,'\" the Journal reported.\n\nThe United States has lobbied numerous allies to ban Huawei from their 5G networks but with limited success. Only Australia has fully barred the Chinese telecom so far. The Trump administration has also not yet released its own order barring Huawei from U.S. 5G networks.\n\nPWNED: A jailed former CIA computer engineer who's accused of leaking a massive trove of hacking tools made a series of claims in a legal filing asking to be released from federal detention that many on Twitter noted were outlandish.\n\nJoshua Schulte, who's accused of passing the documents known as Vault 7 to WikiLeaks, claimed he's lost $50 billion during his incarceration, according to independent journalist Marcy Wheeler.\n\nSchulte also \"lost time mentoring and teaching my youngest brother programming as he attends college and most likely learns the wrong way to align braces and indent,\" according to the filing quoted by Cyberscoop's Jeff Stone.\n\nHe's \"also a huge movie buff and I've already missed major blockbuster releases that I would have reserved in advance at Alamo Drafthouse and enjoyed with family and friends,\" the filing states.\n\nSchulte was first charged with storing child pornography in 2017.

(Andy Wong/AP) By Michael Auslin April 29 at 10:55 AM\n\nMichael Auslin is a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and the author of \"The End of the Asian Century.\"\n\nThe 40th anniversary of the normalization of Sino-U.S. relations, which took place on the first day of this year, passed almost unnoticed. Instead of a joint commemoration or high-profile speeches, Washington and Beijing instead traded thinly disguised threats: President Trump signed legislation designed to counter China's growing power in the Indo-Pacific, while Chinese leader Xi Jinping again urged his military to be prepared to wage war. Going from purported partnership to fears of a new Cold War, China and the United States have entered a new era. And even if they manage to come to some sort of agreement to end their long-simmering differences on trade in the next few weeks -- as the Trump administration has been indicating -- that still won't neutralize the larger forces at work.\n\nIt is surprising how quickly attitudes have soured on both sides of the Pacific. Just a few years ago, there was talk of a new Sino-U.S. \"G-2\" that would adjudicate global problems -- a notion that already seems to belong to a long-distant past. Now competition is seen as the new normal. While Beijing feels that Washington is trying to contain China, Americans finally reacted to long-standing feelings that China was taking advantage of American openness and becoming actively hostile to U.S. interests. The final years of the Obama administration saw a sharp deterioration in U.S.-China ties, as Beijing built and militarized islands in the South China Sea and blockbuster reports on the scale of Chinese cyber espionage made headlines.\n\nPresident Trump has made good on his campaign promises to hit back at Chinese unfair practices and aggressive acts. From levying $250 billion worth of tariffs to force the Chinese to the negotiating table, to calling out great-power competition (read: China) in his first National Security Strategy, Trump has upended trans-Pacific ties. His administration is sending more ships through Chinese-claimed waters in Asia, blocking Huawei from U.S. 5G networks, and arresting those stealing trade secrets. Both the administration and Congress have raised the alarm about China's influence operations in the United States and its growing high-tech surveillance state.\n\nWhile trade (estimated at $737 billion) and exchange have produced a complex web of ties between China and the United States, politically the two are steadily pulling apart. The 40th anniversary of normalization marked a crucial boundary, cementing a dynamic of suspicion and increased competition. Beijing continues to push its One Belt One Road Initiative, while ratcheting up both rhetoric and pressure against Taiwan and Hong Kong and imprisoning a million Uighurs in \"reeducation camps.\" Even though increases in military spending have slowed in the past several years (thanks to a slowing economy), Beijing is using much of that estimated $175 billion on advanced weapons such as aircraft carriers, hypersonic missiles and stealth fighters, while billions more are spent on programs not included in the defense budget, such as the space program and paramilitary forces.\n\nThis hasn't gone unnoticed in Washington. The new Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, authored by Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and signed by President Trump at the end of last year, provides $1.5 billion annually through 2023 to build up U.S. alliances and partnerships throughout the Indo-Pacific, on top of existing funding for U.S. forces deployed throughout the region.\n\nThose predicting war between China and the United States are likely to be disappointed, just as were their predecessors who foresaw conflict between Japan and the United States in the 1990s. Yet neither does the future offer grounds for a continuation of business as usual. In reality, China is weakening. Its economy is slowing, its technology is coming under suspicion, and its offers of foreign aid awaken suspicions among potential recipients. Meanwhile, Chinese citizens continue to offshore as much of their money as they can, while criticism of Xi slowly gathers beneath the surface of his cult of personality. While the trade war is hurting small American manufacturers and some big ones such as Apple, China is feeling far more squeezed, with growth dropping to 30-year lows as weaknesses in China's economy are exacerbated by the tariff battle.\n\nChina's mounting problems do not mean that it will suddenly reform or turn away from competition with the United States. In the short term, it may indeed become more dangerous, as Xi attempts to deflect growing dissatisfaction at home with adventurism abroad. Yet it is China that has abused the openness of the global system through its mercantilist policies, rampant stealing of intellectual property, and the use of \"debt trap diplomacy\" on smaller nations. By not attempting earlier to curb China's actions, successive U.S. administrations made the inevitable reckoning that much more painful.\n\nBeijing's hand is weaker, however, and the Trump administration can offer some easing of pressure as long as the real problems we have with China are addressed. The Chinese need to realize that is in their best interests to adopt more cooperative policies to reduce tension with Washington. Whatever else happens, the next phase of the relationship will be starkly different from the previous 40 years.

He took a break from the mining ore business to travel to a VR theme park in this Chinese provincial capital not known for high technology.\n\n\"It feels like reality,\" Liu said after shooting down robots in a virtual fighter jet, strapped to a spinning gyroscope lit in purple. \"It's just like you're riding in a plane.\"\n\nEnthusiasm for VR has cooled somewhat after years of hype, but China's leaders are trying to drum up excitement, hoping to take the lead in a technology they expect will eventually gain wide use.\n\nHoping to coax homegrown entrepreneurs to take the plunge, the government is educating students, subsidizing office spaces, and sponsoring conferences and competitions.\n\nNanchang's VR Star park offers 42 rides and exhibits, including VR bumper cars and VR shoot-'em-ups. It's the highlight of Nanchang's \"VR base,\" a sprawling complex of mostly still empty, futuristic glass-and-steel offices.\n\nThe city of 5.5 million is the capital of Jiangxi province, a relatively impoverished region nestled in the mountains of south-central China, where the regional industries are copper mining and rice.\n\nOfficials hope that one day it will be a world-class hub for virtual reality.\n\n\"Frankly, VR isn't 100% necessary in the Chinese market at the moment,\" said Xiong Zongming, CEO of IN-UP Technology, one of dozens of firms being incubated by the VR base. \"But with the government's push, many other companies, departments and agencies are more willing to try it out.\"\n\nXiong was born in Nanchang but studied and worked in Japan for nearly a decade before returning to China, where he settled in Shanghai. Nanchang officials enticed him back home with offers of free rent and 150,000 RMB ($22,340) in startup funds, part of an effort to lure back local talent from richer coastal cities to help lift the local economy.\n\nBeijing began its VR drive a few years ago, when slick headsets from Samsung, Oculus, HTC and Sony were making a big splash at electronics shows in the U.S.\n\nChinese leaders were worried they might miss out on a boom.\n\nVR is included in Beijing's \"Made in China 2025\", an ambitious plan to develop global competitors in cutting edge technologies including electric cars, solar and wind power, and robotics. Nanchang is one of several VR hubs across the country.\n\nSo far, VR is mostly a niche product used in gaming and business training, held back by expensive, clunky headsets, a lack of appealing software and other shortcomings. Analysts say it could be many years, perhaps decades, before the technology goes mainstream.\n\nLast year, just 5.8 million VR headsets were sold globally, according to market research firm Ovum. That compares with sales of more than 1.5 billion smartphones and is far fewer than expected when VR fever was at its peak a few years back.\n\n\"My experience wasn't good,\" said Xu Xiao, a PC gamer who bought VR goggles over a year ago after graduating from college. \"When I wore them, my eyes got dry and uncomfortable, and I got dizzy. I barely use them anymore.\"\n\nStopping by the Nanchang VR park, he was still unimpressed.\n\n\"The image quality isn't refined, and it's hard to operate,\" he said after a virtual flume ride.\n\nEven if it's a gamble, analysts say China's state-led push into VR could pay off in the future. Nanchang's VR developers are marching on despite a wave of layoffs across the industry in the past few years. Thousands attended Nanchang's first VR conference last October.\n\n\"It's kind of a good move to be there now,\" says George Jijiashvili, a senior analyst at Ovum. \"It's a long game, and I don't think it's going away anytime soon.\"\n\nBeijing still lags behind: Most VR headsets are designed by companies based outside mainland China like Samsung, HTC, and Oculus and the major VR content platforms are run by giants like Facebook and Google.\n\nChina's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology aims to change that by encouraging banks to finance VR startups and directing local governments to invest in VR products for public projects such as schools and tourist sites.\n\nThe government has provided subsidies and purchases of VR software, mostly focused on education, training, and health care software. Nanchang has a 1 billion RMB ($149 million) VR startup investment fund, and is setting up another fund to attract established VR companies.\n\nEntrepreneurs and experts believe VR will get a boost from next generation, or 5G, technologies where Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies are industry leaders. 5G promises blazing-fast connection speeds that could smooth lags and optimize multiplayer games and livestreaming so VR users might not end up with the headaches some get with today's technology.\n\n\"VR e-sports, broadcasting concerts in VR format, remote surgery -- all of this is only realistic in the 5G era,\" said Chenyu Cui, a senior analyst at IHS Markit. \"It'll make VR better for a mass audience.\"\n\nSince the main commercial market for VR is entertainment, many of China's VR content makers are game developers in Shenzhen or Beijing. They're subject to booms and busts and recently, business has been flagging.\n\nThe state support is helping to protect Nanchang's developers from the cycles of feast and famine, but for now the industry is in a lull, and Xiong, the VR entrepreneur, is focused on keeping his startup afloat.\n\nHis dream is that one day, China's bet on VR will turn his thirteen-person company into an industry giant.\n\n\"I look forward to the day we can go public,\" Xiong said, \"and become a role model for the whole province.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Yanan Wang contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By Hugh Hewitt Hugh Hewitt April 27 at 4:55 PM\n\nThe 2020 election isn't going to be close.\n\nThe first-quarter gross domestic product growth rate of 3.2 percent sets up the first reality that will be noted in November 2020 because it telegraphs where the economy will be then: not in recession. Recessions are charted when GDP growth is negative for two consecutive quarters or more. That can and has occurred in sudden fashion -- financial panics don't send \"save the date\" cards. But the economy over which President Trump is presiding is strong and getting stronger. Innovation is accelerating, not declining. A recession before Election Day looks less and less likely by the day.\n\nSmall wonder then that Trump dominates the GOP with an approval rating above 80 percent. His administration's deregulatory push is accelerating. More and more rule-of-law judges, disinclined to accept bureaucrats' excuses for overregulation, are being confirmed to the bench. Readiness levels in the U.S. military have been renewed. Our relationship with our strongest ally, Israel, is at its closest in decades.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dems are facing a Hobbesian choice of Sens. Bernie Sanders or Kamala D. Harris, or former vice president Joe Biden. Sanders and Harris are too far to the left, Sanders by a lot. Biden is far past his best years. The nice folk lower down are looking for other rewards. The nomination going to someone such as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is possible, I suppose, but what happens when the dog chasing the car catches it? What was an entertaining and amusing aside suddenly becomes a commitment and, with that, well, comes a barrage of attacks. Where Trump deflects incoming with ease, the Democrats scatter, some limping away, some blown out of the picture.\n\nThis will come as news to #Resistance liberals, who are certain Trump will lose, because they dislike him so much. They still haven't figured out that 40 percent of the country love him and at least another 10 percent are very much committed to considering the alternative in comparison to Trump, not reflexively voting against him. That decile is doing very well in this economy. Unemployment remains incredibly low. The markets are soaring. That's not a given for the fall of 2020, but better to be soaring than falling 18 months out.\n\nOn immigration, border security has always been a legitimate concern (and Immigration and Customs Enforcement a legitimate agency). People don't talk much about it as they decline to state anything that will earn them the label racist, but the reality of open borders is understood to be an unqualified disaster by most of the country, and most of the country understands the Democrats to be arguing for a de facto open-border system, if not a de jure one.\n\nThe Green New Deal sounds like a bad science-fair project where the smart kids got the colors to combine via an elaborate device and make all the \"lava\" flow black down the volcanoes' sides and the village is destroyed. Medicare-for-all is a Professor Harold Hill production, headed for Iowa as was the Music Man. There's not a lot of serious thinking or talking among the Ds about the People's Republic of China and the \"nine-dash line\" in the South China Sea (which many may think is some sort of shorthand for their marks on the debate stage), or Huawei, which is just too complicated to try to debate in five-minute exchanges. Sen. Elizabeth Warren's turn as Madame Defarge may even wake up some of the wealthy-woke to their peril. It's a circus coming to a cable-news network near you soon.\n\nLast week's message from a booming economy should have rocked the Democratic field. Alas, the party seems collectively intent on poring over the Mueller report yet again in the hope that, somehow, someway, there's something there. But the probe is over. No collusion. No obstruction. Democrats have to campaign on something else besides a great economy, rising values of savings, low unemployment across every demographic, clarity about allies and enemies abroad, and a rebuilding military. It's a tough needle to thread, condemning everything about Trump except all that he has accomplished that President Barack Obama couldn't or wouldn't.

Then, on Tuesday, American officials wrestled with allies over a United Nations measure on combating rape during wartime.\n\nAnd on Friday, President Trump announced he was \"taking our signature back\" from a global treaty on conventional arms sales that went into effect in 2014.\n\nAll of that, along with a shift last week on Cuba policy that angered European leaders, has reinforced the notion that the United States is becoming a rogue superpower as it continues to embrace unpredictable \"me first\" actions, with little care about upending the traditional world order.\n\nNew questions are being raised over whether the Trump administration is sacrificing what should be long-term priorities -- namely, countering China and Russia as outlined in the National Security Strategy -- for short-term obsessions with much weaker nations that pose no real threat to the United States, notably Iran, Venezuela and Cuba.\n\nThe relentless drive of Mr. Trump and his top foreign policy officials to pressure smaller nations has inflamed allies. The damage to relations will be difficult to repair even after Mr. Trump leaves office, diplomats warn, because of rising rancor and a huge erosion of trust that could lead allies to strengthen ties with other powers.\n\n\"You have a bad combination of unilateralism and narcissism,\" said William J. Burns, a deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration and a 33-year foreign service veteran who wrote in a new book about the decline of diplomacy under Mr. Trump.\n\n\"We're digging a hole for ourselves,\" Mr. Burns said. \"It's not like the rest of the world is going to sit by while we get our act together. So rivals take advantage. Allies start to lose faith and hedge.\"\n\nFrom Mr. Trump's perspective, the United States is tackling global issues in a realistic manner with his \"America First\" approach -- working with allies so long as it benefits American interests.\n\n\"Our mission is to champion the American way of life,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told State Department employees on Friday.\n\nBut in one notable example, the United States risked the cooperation of Turkey, South Korea, Japan and India on critical security issues when it expanded its ban on Iranian oil exports worldwide.\n\nTrump administration officials want to coordinate with India to counterbalance China, by far the greatest challenger to American supremacy. The United States is also working with South Korea and Japan to deal with both China and North Korea, which, unlike Iran, has a growing nuclear arsenal.\n\nAnd Turkey, a fellow North Atlantic Treaty Organization member, is a key partner in the effort to bring stability to Syria. Negotiations to keep Turkey from growing too close to Russia after its decision to buy a missile defense system from Moscow are also continuing.\n\n\"Turkey rejects unilateral sanctions and impositions on how to conduct relations with neighbors,\" the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said Monday on Twitter. Turkey is looking to continue buying Iranian oil even after its exemption from the sanctions ends on May 2.\n\nThe moves this month have strained relations well beyond the pain inflicted by the Mr. Trump's repeated denunciations of NATO allies and his withdrawals in 2017 from the global Paris climate agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nThe backlash is evident in growing resistance among European allies to American requests to reject technology from the Chinese company Huawei in next-generation 5G telecommunications networks. Meanwhile, officials from more than 150 nations are in Beijing for a conference on China's global infrastructure program, the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nThe Trump administration has done little to assuage European allies already on edge.\n\nMr. Trump lifted longstanding limits on American citizens suing over property that had been confiscated by the Cuban government after the Communist revolution. European officials strongly objected -- and threatened to sue the United States at the World Trade Organization -- over concerns the shift would harm foreign companies with ties to Cuba.\n\nAdministration officials threatened to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution, drafted by Germany, that sought to combat the use of rape as a weapon of war. The officials demanded the measure be stripped of language on reproductive and sexual health. Several top American officials are evangelical Christians, including Mr. Pompeo, and have taken strong stands on issues related to abortion. The Security Council approved the resolution on Tuesday in a significantly weakened form.\n\n\"The current president doesn't care about the West,\" the retiring French ambassador to the United States, G\u00e9rard Araud, said in an interview with Foreign Policy magazine. \"He is a nationalist. He is America alone.\"\n\nLatin American countries also are angered by the United States' increasing intractability, even as China tries to make inroads into the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe State Department is planning to cut aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador because of what Mr. Trump has called failures to stem migration to the United States. That has weakened American warnings about doing business with China and demands that Guatemala and Honduras continue to recognize the self-governing island of Taiwan rather than China. (El Salvador already switched recognition last year, prompting a rebuke from Washington.)\n\nBut nothing has strained relations between the United States and other nations more than the anti-Iran campaign led by Mr. Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser.\n\nWorld powers that entered the Iran nuclear deal with the United States in 2015 objected to Mr. Trump's withdrawal last year and the American sanctions that were later imposed. European nations have created a financial transaction system to continue doing business with Iran.\n\nIraqi leaders are defying American demands that they stop buying natural gas and electricity from Iran and cut ties with Iranian military officials. Iraq and the United States partnered in the fight against the Islamic State, an effort that was paralleled by Iran, which is an ally of Baghdad.\n\nIn India, officials were surprised and disappointed by the reversal on the Iranian oil purchase waivers, citing earlier assurances by Washington they would be allowed to continue buying the oil.\n\nA senior Indian official noted that New Delhi had shown loyalty to Washington. It was weighing ending all oil imports from Venezuela -- not because it agreed with the Trump administration's hard-line position on Venezuela, but because India considers the United States a strategic partner.\n\nThe Indian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also expressed disappointment in the Trump administration's decision in March to remove India from a trade program that gave the country tariff-free access to the United States. The same was done to Turkey.\n\nMr. Trump's aggressive approach to trade has irritated other partner nations, including Canada, France and Japan.\n\n\"You have a big stick, and you don't care who your interlocutor is,\" Mr. Araud said. \"You treat China the same way you treat the U.K. or the European Union.\"\n\nBoth South Korea and Japan have endured rounds of bilateral trade negotiations with the United States. And both also asked the United States not to end the Iranian oil waivers, as did China, Iran's biggest customer.\n\nThe United States needs help from those three nations to pressure North Korea to give up its dozens of nuclear weapons. Iran has no nuclear weapons and is not yet moving to develop any, according to American intelligence assessments.\n\n\"These decisions probably won't torpedo those relationships, but they will add to an already long list of bilateral irritants at a time when we need unity,\" said Kelly Magsamen, who was the Pentagon's top Asia-Pacific policy official at the end of the Obama administration.\n\n\"The biggest problem is that America is no longer consistent,\" she said.\n\nMr. Burns, the former American diplomat, said Mr. Trump would do well to remember that the United States is no longer the world's singular dominant player. That, he said, has raised the significance of global alliances and working with coalitions of countries.\n\n\"We have a window before us within which we can help reshape those institutions and that order before it gets reshaped for us by the rise of other powers and other events,\" Mr. Burns said. \"The problem is that window is not going to stay open forever.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "edward_wong@nytimes.com", "name": "Edward Wong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/26/us/politics/26dc-diplo1-sub/26dc-diplo1-sub-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 294004980}, {"uri": "1121511357", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-25", "time": "22:51:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-25T22:51:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.47843137383461, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/04/25/united-states-europe-divided-by-china/", "title": "Opinion | The United States and Europe, divided by China", "body": "Engineers from EE inspect Huawei's 5G equipment overlook St. Paul's Cathedral in London on March 15. (Simon Dawson/Bloomberg) By Sebastian Mallaby Sebastian Mallaby April 25 at 6:23 PM\n\nPresident Trump doesn't have much in the way of kind words for the transatlantic alliance. As a candidate, Trump called NATO \"obsolete.\" As president, he has reportedly asked aides why the United States should not abandon it.\n\nThe reality, though, is that NATO is thriving. Funding for the U.S. military presence in Europe is increasing. NATO has put combat-ready multinational battle groups into the Baltic republics and Poland. It has a new cyberspace operations center in Belgium. Despite transatlantic fights on trade, climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, Europe and the United States agree that Russia's Vladimir Putin is a menace and they are rising to the challenge.\n\nThe same cannot be said on China. This week, Britain, traditionally the European ally most in sync with the Pentagon, reportedly brushed off threats from Washington by deciding to build parts of its fifth-generation (or 5G) wireless network with equipment from the Chinese telecom giant, Huawei. Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had urged allies to shun Huawei, suggesting that the United States would not be able to share intelligence with countries that compromised network security by buying Chinese gear. Britain has said boo to them.\n\nThis British defiance follows a European pattern. Huawei has conducted 5G trials in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and Turkey. Last month, Italy laid out the red carpet for President Xi Jinping and a 500-strong group, becoming the first Group of Seven nation to endorse China's global influence-buying program known as the Belt and Road Initiative. During Barack Obama's presidency, the United States urged European allies to boycott the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Germany, France, Britain, Italy and more than a dozen smaller European states ignored U.S. pressure.\n\nIt's easy to see why transatlantic solidarity against Russia is not matched by a common China policy. Since the annexation of Crimea, Putin has posed an obvious threat to his European neighbors; in contrast, China's habit of threatening Taiwan and turning rocky islands into fortresses seems abstract in Berlin or Paris. Since the loss of empire, Europeans have grown used to not being the global hegemons. In the United States, the fact that China will have the world's largest economy within a few years feels altogether more disturbing.\n\nUnsurprising though it may be, this Western division over China needs to be fixed urgently. The biggest threat to liberal democracies is not stagnant economies, inequality or populism. It is that the world's new superpower is hostile to liberal values. China's leaders are growing more autocratic domestically, more assertive internationally and more accomplished at marshaling technology to augment state power. In the near term, Russia's swaggering strongman may be the West's most troublesome adversary. In the longer run, China's patient dictatocrats present the more profound challenge.\n\nTo forge a common front on China, the United States must become less arrogant. China, unlike the Soviet Union of old, is deeply integrated into the global economy. It is therefore unrealistic for the United States to demand that Europe cut commercial ties with Chinese companies such as Huawei. The Trump administration has run this experiment. It has only exposed the limits to its influence.\n\nEurope, for its part, must become less supine. The continent's business and policy leaders sometimes insinuate that the Trump administration's hostility to Huawei merely reflects the commercial interests of the U.S. tech lobby. They don't reckon with the fact that, when 5G-enabled autonomous vehicles become commonplace on Western streets, a foreign power that hacks the network could turn those vehicles into deadly weapons. The Chinese state requires its companies to collaborate with it on national security. A network built on Chinese gear is obviously less safe than one built on Western gadgetry.\n\nThere is a middle way, and it starts with the Trump administration fixing its own errors. Huawei is the dominant supplier of 5G equipment partly because the United States is marginalizing itself -- it is set on building its network using a different part of the spectrum than that favored in other countries. Next, rather than wishfully demanding a Europe free of Huawei, the administration should focus on managing the world as it is. It should call for continuous testing and monitoring of network equipment to track down vulnerabilities. It should consider whether some parts of 5G networks are more sensitive than others. (Confusingly, experts disagree on this.) Perhaps most significant, it should insist on robust encryption of applications that run on the network. To analogize: If the 5G highway cannot be rendered totally secure, you had better navigate it in an armored vehicle.\n\nIf this week's reports are right, the decision by Britain's National Security Council points toward this compromise. Britain apparently plans to use Huawei's gear only outside the \"core\" of its network. Its cyberdefense agency has been monitoring Huawei's equipment in the existing 4G network and has sometimes lambasted the company for supplying slipshod code; it will continue to play hardball in the future.

Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg (Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg) By Brian Fung and Brian Fung Reporter focusing on telecommunications, media, and competition Ellen Nakashima Ellen Nakashima National security reporter April 25 at 5:13 PM\n\nTop British officials have decided to let the Chinese technology giant Huawei help develop an ultra-fast 5G wireless network in the United Kingdom, according to reports, in spite of pressure by U.S. officials to freeze out the company on security grounds.\n\nThe leaked decision by Britain's National Security Council -- a panel led by Prime Minister Theresa May -- risks inflaming tensions between the U.K. and the Trump administration as Huawei flexes its muscles as the world's dominant supplier of telecom equipment. And it instantly created a political firestorm among members of Parliament determined to hunt down the source of the leak.\n\nBritain's decision to move forward with Huawei will not be official until it is announced by the secretary for digital culture and reported to Parliament. But the council's conclusion to let Huawei participate, even in a limited way, in Britain's 5G rollout is a significant diplomatic defeat for the United States, which has argued that Huawei's networking equipment cannot be trusted -- and could be used for spying purposes or to disrupt networks.\n\nFollowing the reports, White House national security council spokesman Garrett Marquis said on Twitter that the Trump administration is continuing to work \"across government & with allies & partners to mitigate risk in the deployment of communications infrastructure.\"\n\nHe added: \"As the President has said, '5G networks must be secure. They must be strong. They have to be guarded from the enemy-we do have enemies out there...'\"\n\nSome analysts said the British decision sets a precedent that other countries are likely to follow.\n\n\"Now countries are less likely to do a complete ban,\" said James Lewis, a cyber policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has followed the international 5G debate closely.\n\nLewis said it was still possible that the British decision, when it is announced, could reduce risk to a manageable level. \"If the British implement their restrictions in a tough way, it's not a big deal. If they implement them in a soft way, then Huawei will be all over the network,\" he said.\n\nFor instance, Huawei will continue to be barred, as it is in the 4G networks, from the \"core\" of Britain's 5G network, which contains routers and switches handling massive volumes of traffic, officials said. The limitations are also expected to include geographic restrictions near sensitive networks.\n\nBut not all experts are so sure such restrictions will be sufficient.\n\nMalcolm Turnbull, Australia's former prime minister, said that even if Huawei is limited to the network \"edge,\" or where radio antennae connect with user devices, the risk is still there.\n\n\"With 5G we have had to recognize that the core/edge distinction no longer exists,\" Turnbull said in a speech in New York on Thursday. That is why Australia last year became the first nation to put in place new requirements on \"high risk\" vendors that effectively banned Huawei from the country's 5G network. Such vendors, the government determined, could be subject to directions from foreign intelligence services to act contrary to national security.\n\n\"Our decision was not taken lightly\" or based on \"near term threats,\" he said. Rather, it was \"a long-term prudent hedge.\"\n\nReports indicated that several members of the security council, including the home, foreign and defense secretaries, had expressed reservations about the plan. Britain's GCHQ intelligence service last month delivered a scathing assessment of Huawei security risks in the 4G networks. But, according to British press reports, May gave the green light.\n\nThe decision was first reported by The Daily Telegraph on Wednesday after May and other ministers on the council met to discuss Huawei's possible role in the 5G network.\n\n5G proponents say the wireless technology will lead to mobile download speeds up to 100 times faster than what is found on the 4G LTE in many smartphones today. And, they say, it will pave the way for future technologies such as self-driving cars and a world of networked, smart appliances. The United States is racing against other countries to get a critical mass of consumers connected to 5G, in hopes that U.S. businesses will be the ones to create the Uber and Spotify of the future.\n\nHuawei celebrated the decision, tweeting: \"5G means 5G: British PM Theresa May defies U.S. instructions to ban Huawei by granting the Chinese tech giant access to its 5G network. #HuaweiFacts.\"\n\nThe leak on the British decision came in a week in which Huawei's dominance of the global 5G equipment market was made clear by the Chinese company's first-ever quarterly earnings report, announcing revenues of $26.7 billion -- a 39 percent increase over the same time last year -- and promising \"a year of large-scale deployment of 5G around the world.\"\n\nThe company said Monday it has signed 40 deals with wireless carriers to provide 5G equipment so far and has shipped more than 70,000 5G base stations -- the sophisticated radios that allow 5G cell sites to communicate with mobile devices. Huawei had previously issued financial updates only twice a year.\n\nHuawei's results far outstripped those of its closest competitors -- Finland's Nokia, which reported revenues of $5.7 billion for the quarter, and Sweden's Ericsson, with $5.1 billion. On his company's earnings call, Nokia chief executive Rajeev Suri acknowledged that the firm faced \"a weak quarter.\" Together, the three companies account for a majority of the global telecom equipment market. There are no U.S. manufacturers of 5G wireless gear.\n\nIn Europe, Huawei already has a substantial presence in the continent's 4G networks. The firm has not built its gear to be \"interoperable\" or easily meshed with other companies' equipment. If a telecom company wants to replace Huawei gear, it must rip it out and install new equipment -- a double expense.\n\n\"This is a cost that either the telecom operators have to cover by themselves or the state [has to defray],\" said Karol Okonski, Poland's secretary of state and minister of digital affairs, in an interview Wednesday. In Poland, Huawei is present in the core and the radio networks. So are the two other major vendors, Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson.\n\nPoland, he said, is still weighing its 5G policy and hopes to have guidelines prepared by the end of June.\n\n\"It's highly unlikely that we would ban Huawei completely from the Polish market,\" he said. \"But at the same time it's hard to say whether we will be able to make our telecommunications infrastructure secure without intervention. The best scenario would be to come up with security rules that would allow us not to ban anyone but still feel that in the end our networks will be secure.\"\n\nHe added: \"We might have to have some limited ban on some of the vendors, otherwise we'll feel it impossible to secure our networks in a way that we and our allies expect.\"\n\nU.S. security officials have been quietly preparing for all contingencies, including the prospect of other countries allowing Huawei equipment in their systems.\n\nLast month, Sue Gordon, the deputy to the Director of National Intelligence, told an audience at the University of Texas, Austin, \"we are going to have to figure out a way in a 5G world that we're able to manage the risks in a diverse network that includes technology that we can't trust.\"\n\nOfficials have not let up at all on their efforts to persuade partners that Huawei's presence poses a risk. But, Gordon said, \"you have to presume a dirty network.\"\n\nIndustry officials and analysts said it is difficult without seeing details of the British restrictions to assess their impact on cyber and national security.\n\nEven though Huawei will be barred from the network core, the radio antennas will contain more sensitive information than before hosted in the cloud, experts said. \"There is a lot more automated response, threat detection and mitigation happening in the edge, which also could introduce vulnerabilities,\" said one 5G industry official whose firm had not authorized him to speak on the record.\n\n\"It's true that if you want to do the worst things -- like disrupt a network -- you probably have to get to the routers,\" the industry official said. \"But that does not mean you cannot cause very serious problems through the radio networks. It's just harder to do. But not impossible at all.\"\n\nEarlier this month, in remarks in Washington, NSA Director Paul Nakasone said the concern with Huawei is it being headquartered in a nation \"that doesn't have respect for the rule of law, that doesn't have a series of norms, that has a very, very concerted effort to partner both their government and their private sector together to make sure that the government's will is being done.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's not the fact that we have a smoking gun that we can't identify. We have a loaded gun when you think about an adversary that has the ability to control your infrastructure.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VZf4GErVkkrjinMielkdzWtqVy4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WUB26PTGVAI6TJUYFKHYBDE47M.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4745793", "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 293927100}, {"uri": "1121030620", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-25", "time": "11:01:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-25T11:01:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.843137264251709, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/technology/who-owns-huawei.html", "title": "Who Owns Huawei? The Company Tried to Explain. It Got Complicated.", "body": "SHENZHEN, China -- For one of the world's largest technology companies, it should be a simple question:\n\nWho owns Huawei?\n\nAs the Chinese smartphone and telecommunications equipment giant battles the United States government over whether it should be allowed to build the world's mobile networks, the company has been going to great lengths to present itself as open, transparent and trustworthy.\n\nIt has not always worked out. One reason is that certain simple questions about Huawei do not have simple answers.\n\nThe chief secretary of Huawei's board of directors, Jiang Xisheng, spoke for more than 90 minutes to a small group of reporters on Thursday. The goal was to help explain the company's ownership after two American researchers wrote a report accusing Huawei of being misleading about the issue.\n\nMr. Jiang's explanation boiled down to this: On paper, he said, Huawei is owned by a labor union that solicits donations from employees when their colleagues have health problems and the like. The union also supervises the company basketball club, Mr. Jiang said.\n\nNaturally, it is a little more complicated than that.\n\nHuawei's ownership is a murky matter because the company has never, in more than three decades of existence, sold shares to the public. The firm says it is entirely owned by its employees, and that no outside organizations, including any affiliated with the Chinese government, own shares.\n\nBut these assurances have never quite dispelled American officials' suspicions that Beijing and the Communist Party are somehow pulling the strings. Top American officials have also been alarmed by new Chinese laws that require companies to assist in national intelligence work.\n\nHuawei on Thursday showed reporters what it described as evidence of its independence: a big blue book, kept behind glass and under lock and key in a drab white room at the company's headquarters in Shenzhen, the southern Chinese city.\n\nWithin its 10 volumes are said to be the names of all the Huawei employees who hold so-called \"restricted phantom shares\" in the company -- proof, the company says, that no piece of Huawei is owned by the Chinese government.\n\nThis, too, is not as simple as it seems.\n\nOver the past year, Washington's long-simmering distrust toward Huawei, the world's leading maker of the equipment that powers cellphone networks, has morphed into an all-out assault on the company.\n\nHuawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, are facing criminal charges in the United States related to theft of trade secrets and violations of sanctions on Iran. American officials have urged other governments to bar mobile carriers from using Huawei's gear in their next-generation wireless networks, arguing that oceans of sensitive data could be exposed to Chinese intelligence-gathering.\n\nTo counter claims that it is opaque and secretive, Huawei recently reported quarterly financial results for the first time. And it has invited reporters from around the world to interview company leaders, including Ren Zhengfei, its powerful founder and chief executive.\n\nBut to Huawei's critics, such gestures hardly put to rest the question of whether the company is susceptible to Chinese state influence.\n\nChina's government exerts control over the country's private businesses in many ways, some of them unofficial and never disclosed. Huawei executives have said repeatedly that they do not act on Beijing's behalf. But absent the kind of constant, independent scrutiny that a publicly listed company would face, outsiders can only decide whether to take Huawei's word for it.\n\n\"It's hard to prove if you're not at least a partially publicly traded company,\" said Xiaomeng Lu of Access Partnership, a policy consulting firm.\n\nBy exposing themselves to the vetting needed to list their shares on American stock exchanges, Ms. Lu said, other Chinese technology firms have put the wider world at greater ease about the way they are run.\n\n\"That's a kind of seal of approval,\" she said.\n\nHuawei, however, believes it has flourished because it does not face the short-term financial pressures that publicly held companies do. And so, the company has devised an ownership structure that allows it to use shares to motivate employees while still remaining closely held.\n\nHere is where it gets complicated.\n\nAccording to Chinese corporate records, Huawei Technologies is wholly owned by a holding company called Huawei Investment & Holding.\n\nThat holding company has two shareholders, corporate records say. Mr. Ren, Huawei's chief executive, owns a little more than 1 percent of shares. The rest are owned by an entity called the Union of Huawei Investment & Holding.\n\nThis is Huawei's labor union, Mr. Jiang said on Thursday, and it owns most of the company purely out of legal convenience. Under Chinese law, only certain kinds of entities can be the registered owners of a closely held company, and a labor union is one of them.\n\nThe union has no influence over the company's business operations, Mr. Jiang said. It does, however, supervise after-work activities for employees.\n\nThat basketball club, for instance. The badminton and ping-pong clubs too, Mr. Jiang said.\n\nHuawei's union is registered with the Shenzhen city government's union and pays dues. But the municipal union has no influence over the Huawei union's operations or the company, Mr. Jiang said.\n\nWhat, then, does Huawei actually mean when it says that it is employee-owned? Mr. Jiang described the company's program for allowing workers to own a kind of virtual Huawei stock.\n\nShares of this virtual stock let employees share in the company's financial success (and its losses). And they entitle their holders to elect members to Huawei's Representatives' Commission, which in turn elects members of the board of directors.\n\nTechnically, all of this is separate from the union, which is the company's registered legal owner. Huawei's virtual shares also differ from conventional shares in key ways.\n\nThey cannot, for instance, be transferred to others or owned by non-employees. And if an employee leaves Huawei, the company buys the shares back, unless the employee has reached a certain level of seniority.\n\nThe researchers who wrote the report questioning Huawei's ownership -- Christopher Balding, a professor at Fulbright University Vietnam, and Donald C. Clarke, a Chinese law expert at George Washington University -- say that Huawei's virtual stock program \"has nothing to do with financing or control\" and is \"purely a profit-sharing incentive scheme.\"\n\nMr. Jiang rejected this argument, saying that holders of Huawei virtual shares bear the risk that their shares will decline in value, and that they are entitled to a portion of the company's assets if it goes bankrupt.\n\nStill, he acknowledged on Thursday that it was unclear whether Huawei's efforts to explain all this would assuage any concerns in Washington.\n\n\"With some people,\" he said, \"no matter what you say to them, they will only say what they want to say. They won't listen to you.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "raymond_zhong@nytimes.com", "name": "Raymond Zhong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/25/business/25huawei/merlin_153901455_9d10f787-59eb-4ace-b49a-432e05d1bf3f-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4749730", "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 293886060}, {"uri": "1120135566", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-24", "time": "11:58:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-24T11:58:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.772549033164978, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2019/04/24/the-cybersecurity-202-dhs-is-pushing-cybersecurity-support-to-presidential-campaigns/5cbfb5981ad2e52459e24664/", "title": "Analysis | The Cybersecurity 202: DHS is pushing cybersecurity support to presidential campaigns", "body": "Christopher Krebs, director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is offering to help test and improve the cybersecurity of Democratic presidential campaigns -- and this time, these services are getting a lot of interest.\n\n\"We haven't had anyone decline to have a call with us or not be excited about the resources we're offering or the support or services,\" DHS senior adviser on election security Matt Masterson said of offers to the crowded field of 2020 candidates, during a panel discussion at the Atlantic Council's International Conference on Cyber Engagement.\n\nThat's a far better reception than ahead of the 2018 midterms, when state election officials broadly rejected DHS's offer to help with their cybersecurity early in the Trump administration. Despite the Russian hacking and influence operation that upended the presidential election, state officials were concerned DHS aid could lead to a federal takeover of election administration and were angered by the department's slow pace sharing information about Russia's 2016 hacking attempts.\n\nIt was well into 2017 before some states changed their tune and began working with DHS on girding their election systems against hacking from Russia and elsewhere in the midterm elections.\n\nNow, the acceptance of free help from DHS is a sign the campaigns and states are getting on the same page as the federal government about the need for security to protect both voter information and the integrity of the vote.\n\n\"They, I think, realize the risk and vulnerability that are out there and the need to secure their systems,\" Masterson said. \"We haven't had any conversations that suggest people aren't taking this seriously and don't see the real risks out there.\"\n\nDHS is offering campaigns all the services it offered to state election officials in advance of the 2018 midterm elections, including scanning their computer networks for bugs and doing more complex penetration testing, according to Chris Krebs, director of DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\nCampaigns are especially vulnerable to hacking because they form quickly with a mix of professional and volunteer staff -- many of whom many not be especially digitally savvy. They're also typically hyper-focused on winning votes, donations and news cycles to stay in the race, rather than on tedious administrative tasks such as ensuring everyone is following proper protocols before accessing sensitive databases or guarding against phishing emails.\n\nKrebs, on the sidelines of the Atlantic Council conference, declined to say which campaigns his division spoke with and which accepted CISA services. But said he hopes to work with all the presidential campaigns -- Democratic and Republican -- once the field of candidates is settled.\n\n\"If there are two high priorities on election security, it's state and local [election offices] and its campaigns,\" Krebs said. \"We will provide whatever services they request.\"\n\nThere could be trouble, however, if campaigns are wary of letting the federal government nose around computer systems that hold sensitive data such as donor information, opposition research on other candidates or campaign strategies.\n\nThat's the sort of information Russia or another adversary might be most interested in stealing -- either for blackmail or embarrassing leaks -- and in the greatest need of protection. But Democratic campaigns might also be wary of giving access to databases containing sensitive strategy documents to a federal agency that's part of the government of the opposition party -- and ultimately reports to a president who's running for reelection.\n\nAs the 2020 campaign progresses, Krebs said he'd consider creating an external organization that provides the same cybersecurity services CISA offers but doesn't report directly to DHS.\n\nA model for that organization could be the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, he said -- a nonprofit organization that receives federal government funding and shares cybersecurity threat information among federal, state and local governments.\n\nLiisa Past, a former Estonian cybersecurity official, described during the Atlantic Council conference the model that government uses to secure campaigns: Estonian government cybersecurity pros test every campaign website that touches the public Internet for vulnerabilities but don't touch any internal databases.\n\n\"We knock on the doors and windows, and that's worked very well,\" she said.\n\nOr, DHS could offer some cybersecurity aid with the assistance of organizations that have their own cybersecurity operations and strong relationships with campaigns, including Harvard's Defending Digital Democracy project or the Democratic and Republican National Committees, Krebs said.\n\n\"We'll be working through any option our stakeholders want,\" Krebs said. \"I'm based on demand signals, so if campaigns come and say, 'This is the capability we need,' we'll look at the feasibility of pulling it together.\"\n\nPINGED: Former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was barred from discussing possible Russian interference in the 2018 and 2020 elections in front of President Trump, the New York Times' Eric Schmitt, David E. Sanger and Maggie Haberman reported Thursday.\n\nNielsen, who the Times reported \"had become increasingly concerned about Russia's continued activity in the United States during and after the 2018 midterm elections -- ranging from its search for new techniques to divide Americans using social media, to experiments by hackers, to rerouting internet traffic and infiltrating power grids\" resigned under pressure earlier this month.\n\nHere are more details from the Times: \"In a meeting this year, Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, made it clear that Mr. Trump still equated any public discussion of malign Russian election activity with questions about the legitimacy of his victory. According to one senior administration official, Mr. Mulvaney said it 'wasn't a great subject and should be kept below his level.'\"\n\n\"Even though the Department of Homeland Security has primary responsibility for civilian cyberdefense, Ms. Nielsen eventually gave up on her effort to organize a White House meeting of cabinet secretaries to coordinate a strategy to protect next year's elections.\"\n\n\"As a result, the issue did not gain the urgency or widespread attention that a president can command. And it meant that many Americans remain unaware of the latest versions of Russian interference.\"\n\nPATCHED: The United Kingdom will allow Huawei to build part of its next-generation 5G telecommunications network despite U.S. pressure, the Wall Street Journal's Max Colchester and Dan Strumpf reported.\n\nBut the controversial Chinese telecom will only be allowed to build peripheral sections that perform less vital functions, the Journal reported.\n\nMore from the Journal: \"The decision is a victory for Huawei in its fight against a U.S. campaign to block the use of its 5G equipment in the networks of U.S. allies. The U.S. has long held that Huawei equipment is a security threat, which the telecoms company forcefully denies....The decision came at a meeting of Britain's National Security Council on Tuesday attended by Prime Minister Theresa May and several British government ministers.\"\n\n\"They agreed that Huawei should be allowed to participate in the construction of the network, but would be barred from involvement in its critical core, the official said. The decision wouldn't be final until announced before lawmakers in the House of Commons.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ciaran Martin, the head of GCHQ's National Cyber Security Center, downplayed the rift between the U.S. and its five main intelligence sharing partners over Huawei in a BBC Radio interview. \"It's objectively the case that in the past decade there have been different approaches across the Five Eyes and across the allied wider Western alliance towards Huawei and towards other issues as well,\" Reuters reported from the interview.\n\nPWNED: Krebs also revealed during the Atlantic Council conference that as soon as next week CISA will publish its list of \"critical functions\" that government and industry should prioritize protecting against cyberattacks.\n\nThe general idea of the list is that the \"critical infrastructure\" that DHS helps protect against physical and cyberattacks encompasses too much for the department to protect everything equally -- so it has to identify the most critical of the critical infrastructure.\n\nThe list, which Krebs said will include about 57 critical functions, is the first major output from CISA's National Risk Management Center, which the department launched last year to focus on long-range cybersecurity problems.\n\nKrebs didn't provide specific examples of critical functions, but said the benchmark is services \"that if interrupted ... would literally crater the economy.\" An example that Krebs and other officials have cited in the past is Global Positioning System data, which is vital to everything from trucking to financial transactions.\n\n-- Democrat and Republican leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee are demanding answers from Google amid privacy concerns about a database the company maintains of users' precise location information, according to a letter to CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nThe New York Times's Jennifer Valentino-DeVries profiled the database, which Google calls \"Sensorvault\" and which law enforcement frequently seeks information from during criminal investigations, earlier this month.\n\nHere are details from that report: \"For years, police detectives have given Google warrants seeking location data tied to specific users' accounts.\"\n\n\"But the new warrants, often called 'geofence' requests, instead specify an area near a crime. Google looks in Sensorvault for any devices that were there at the right time and provides that information to the police.... Google first labels the devices with anonymous ID numbers, and detectives look at locations and movement patterns to see if any appear relevant to the crime. Once they narrow the field to a few devices, Google reveals information such as names and email addresses.\"\n\nThe House committee's Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) and ranking Republican Greg Walden (Ore.) want to know how Google uses the database, what privacy protections it applies and whether it's storing other databases of location information.\n\nMore cybersecurity news from the public sector:\n\n-- Apple CEO Tim Cook lashed out during a Time magazine conference Tuesday at the FBI's 2016 attempt to force the company to help crack its own encryption during an investigation into San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook, saying it \"was a very rigged case\" and \"was not the government's finest hour,\" CNBC's Kif Leswing reported.\n\nAn inspector generals' investigation later revealed the FBI didn't explore all possible avenues before asking a federal judge to force Apple's cooperation, and several people inside the bureau believed the goal was to force a court precedent rather than to solve the specific case. The bureau eventually withdrew its case when a third party offered it a way to hack into the phone without Apple's assistance.\n\n\"I have personally never seen the government apparatus move against a company like it did here in a very dishonest manner,\" Cook said.\n\nMore cybersecurity news from the private sector:", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/79ebd12f5b234ae1730449eff132e5a5-5472-3648-70-8-ZEWTDOGVXYI6RA4EXTCUSL7PJE.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "eventUri": "eng-4750187", "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 293803080}, {"uri": "1120014254", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2019-04-24", "time": "09:18:00", "dateTime": "2019-04-24T09:18:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/technology/ecuador-surveillance-cameras-police-government.html", "title": "Made in China, Exported to the World: The Surveillance State", "body": "Made in China, Exported to the World: The Surveillance State\n\nIn Ecuador, cameras across the country send footage to monitoring centers to be examined by police and domestic intelligence. The surveillance system's origin: China.\n\nBy Paul Mozur, Jonah M. Kessel and Melissa Chan\n\nApril 24, 2019\n\nQUITO, Ecuador -- The squat gray building in Ecuador's capital commands a sweeping view of the city's sparkling sprawl, from the high-rises at the base of the Andean valley to the pastel neighborhoods that spill up its mountainsides.\n\nThe police who work inside are looking elsewhere. They spend their days poring over computer screens, watching footage that comes in from 4,300 cameras across the country.\n\nThe high-powered cameras send what they see to 16 monitoring centers in Ecuador that employ more than 3,000 people. Armed with joysticks, the police control the cameras and scan the streets for drug deals, muggings and murders. If they spy something, they zoom in.\n\nThis voyeur's paradise is made with technology from what is fast becoming the global capital of surveillance: China.\n\nEcuador's system, which was installed beginning in 2011, is a basic version of a program of computerized controls that Beijing has spent billions to build out over a decade of technological progress. According to Ecuador's government, these cameras feed footage to the police for manual review.\n\nBut a New York Times investigation found that the footage also goes to the country's feared domestic intelligence agency, which under the previous president, Rafael Correa, had a lengthy track record of following, intimidating and attacking political opponents. Even as a new administration under President Len\u00edn Moreno investigates the agency's abuses, the group still gets the videos.\n\nUnder President Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has vastly expanded domestic surveillance, fueling a new generation of companies that make sophisticated technology at ever lower prices. A global infrastructure initiative is spreading that technology even further.\n\nEcuador shows how technology built for China's political system is now being applied -- and sometimes abused -- by other governments. Today, 18 countries -- including Zimbabwe, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Kenya, the United Arab Emirates and Germany -- are using Chinese-made intelligent monitoring systems, and 36 have received training in topics like \"public opinion guidance,\" which is typically a euphemism for censorship, according to an October report from Freedom House, a pro-democracy research group.\n\nWith China's surveillance know-how and equipment now flowing to the world, critics warn that it could help underpin a future of tech-driven authoritarianism, potentially leading to a loss of privacy on an industrial scale. Often described as public security systems, the technologies have darker potential uses as tools of political repression.\n\n\"They're selling this as the future of governance; the future will be all about controlling the masses through technology,\" Adrian Shahbaz, research director at Freedom House, said of China's new tech exports.\n\nCompanies worldwide provide the components and code of dystopian digital surveillance and democratic nations like Britain and the United States also have ways of watching their citizens. But China's growing market dominance has changed things. Loans from Beijing have made surveillance technology available to governments that could not previously afford it, while China's authoritarian system has diminished the transparency and accountability of its use.\n\nOpinion The Privacy Project The New York Times is launching an ongoing examination of privacy. We'll dig into the ideas, history and future of how our information navigates the digital ecosystem and what's at stake.\n\nFor locals seeking to push back, there is little recourse. Chinese companies operate with less scrutiny and regard for corporate social responsibility than their Western counterparts. Activists in Ecuador say that while they have succeeded in working with civil society groups in Europe and America to oppose sales of surveillance technologies, similar campaigns in China have not been possible.\n\n\"We don't have the capacity to demand information from China -- it's really difficult,\" said the former Ecuadorean legislator Martha Rold\u00f3s.\n\nEcuador's system, called ECU-911, was largely made by two Chinese companies, the state-controlled C.E.I.E.C. and Huawei.\n\nReplicas of the network have been sold to Venezuela, Bolivia and Angola, according to government announcements and Chinese state media.\n\nC.E.I.E.C. and China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement, Huawei said: \"Huawei provides technology to support smart city and safe city programs across the world. In each case, Huawei does not get involved in setting public policy in terms of how that technology is used.\"\n\nIn Ecuador, the cameras that are part of ECU-911 hang from poles and rooftops, from the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands to the Amazonian jungle. The system lets the authorities track phones and may soon get facial-recognition capabilities. Recordings allow the police to review and reconstruct past incidents.\n\nWhile ECU-911 was sold to the public as a way to get a grip on dizzying murder rates and drug-related petty crime, it also served Mr. Correa's authoritarian streak, supporting his feared National Intelligence Secretariat, or Senain, according to a former head of the group. In a rare interview last year at Senain's headquarters in a bunker outside Quito, its leader at the time, Jorge Costa, confirmed that the domestic intelligence group had access to a mirror of the Chinese-built surveillance system.\n\nThe irony is that ECU-911 has not been effective at stopping crime, many Ecuadoreans said, though the system's installation paralleled a period of falling crime rates. Ecuadoreans cite muggings and attacks that happened in front of the cameras without police response. Still, the police have built public support, partly by releasing clips on Twitter and television of thieves and muggers caught on camera.\n\nLeft to choose between privacy and safety, many Ecuadoreans opt for the unblinking gaze of the electronic eyes. With the mass surveillance genie out of the bottle, community leaders have called for cameras to help secure their neighborhoods, even when their own experiences are that the devices do not work well. Concerns about the long-term political implications trail behind the pressing realities of violence and drugs.\n\nMr. Moreno, who came to power in 2017 and has walked back some of Mr. Correa's autocratic policies, has vowed to investigate Senain's abuses and is remaking the intelligence collection agency under a new name. His government helped open up ECU-911 and Senain to The Times.\n\n\"The government viewed espionage as a toolbox, and they could use any tool they wanted,\" Ms. Rold\u00f3s said. \"They could spy on your emails, your phone calls, they would set microphones on your vehicle. At the same time, you had people following you. It was a whole system.\"\n\nDESIGNED BY CHINA, FINANCED BY CHINA\n\nFor a system that was supposed to fight drug dealers and murderers, ECU-911 traces its origins to a different security challenge: the 2008 Olympics.\n\nBefore those Games, a delegation from Ecuador visited Beijing and toured the Chinese capital's surveillance system. At the time, Beijing was pulling footage from 300,000 cameras to keep tabs on 17 million people. The Ecuadoreans left impressed.\n\n\"For the Olympics, China developed emergency response centers which had state-of-the-art technology for its time,\" Francisco Robayo, then the general director of ECU-911, said in an interview last year. \"Our authorities saw these as ideal to bring to Ecuador.\"\n\nThe timing was fortuitous. Mr. Correa was newly in power and facing high crime rates. In January 2011, he made surveillance a priority.\n\nMr. Correa's ministers turned to China. In two months, details to install a Chinese-made technology system were ironed out with the help of military attach\u00e9s from the Chinese Embassy in Quito, according to a person familiar with the process and to publicly available documents from Ecuador's comptroller. Ecuadorean officials traveled again to Beijing to scope out the system, which featured technology made by the parent company of the state-backed C.E.I.E.C.\n\nBy February 2011, with guarantees of state funding from the attach\u00e9s, Ecuador signed a deal with no public bidding process. The country got a Chinese-designed surveillance system financed by Chinese loans. In exchange, Ecuador provided one of its main exports, oil. The money for the cameras and computing flowed straight to C.E.I.E.C. and Huawei.\n\n\"The money always ends up going back to China,\" Ms. Rold\u00f3s said.\n\nIt became a pattern. In exchange for credit facilities that totaled more than $19 billion, Ecuador signed away large portions of its oil reserves. A surge of Chinese-built infrastructure projects, including hydroelectric dams and refineries, followed.\n\nBy comparison, ECU-911 was a small line item.\n\nWith an initial sticker price of more than $200 million, construction started near Guayaquil, a booming coastal city where crime rates are high, Mr. Robayo said. Over the next four years, the system expanded across Ecuador.\n\nCameras were hung anywhere that provided a good view. Operation centers were set up. Top Ecuadorean officials traveled to China for training, and Chinese engineers visited to teach their Ecuadorean counterparts how to work the system.\n\nThe activity attracted attention from Ecuador's neighbors. Venezuelan officials came to see the system, according to a 2013 account from an Ecuadorean official working on the project. In an effort led by the onetime head of intelligence for Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela then sprang for a larger version of the system, with a goal of adding 30,000 cameras. Bolivia followed.\n\nBeijing's ambitions go much further than the abilities those countries bought. Today, the police across China gather material from tens of millions of cameras, and billions of records of travel, internet use and business activities, to keep tabs on citizens. The national watch list of would-be criminals and potential political agitators includes 20 million to 30 million people -- more than Ecuador's population of 16 million.\n\nChinese start-ups, backed in part by American investment, are competing to build methods for automated policing. They create algorithms that look for suspicious patterns in social media use and computer-vision software to track minorities and petitioners across cities. The spending spree has driven down prices for all types of policing gadgets, as varied as identity-card checkers and high-resolution security cameras.\n\nIn China, Ecuador's project received praise. State media held it up as an example of a new China exporting advanced technology, instead of providing low-cost labor to assemble it.\n\nIn 2016, when President Xi visited Ecuador, he stopped by ECU-911 headquarters. Mr. Robayo said Mr. Xi had shown up for about five minutes, enough time for photo opportunities. The snapshots went up on C.E.I.E.C.'s website, a sign of official support from the most powerful Chinese leader in a generation.\n\nA ZOOM WITH A VIEW\n\nTo the government of Mr. Correa, Mario Pazmi\u00f1o was a known man.\n\nA retired Ecuadorean Army colonel who adopted stray dogs -- more than a dozen -- to keep himself busy in the twilight of his career, Mr. Pazmi\u00f1o kept up another pet hobby: criticizing the government of Mr. Correa.\n\nHe complained about police corruption. He argued that Mr. Correa's government was complicit in Ecuador's growing drug trade. He called out what he perceived as the administration's incompetence.\n\nMr. Pazmi\u00f1o's efforts earned him his own retinue of secret police. They set up in an apartment across from his house, and followed him when he went out.\n\nJust as Mr. Ch\u00e1vez had done in Venezuela, Mr. Correa tightened the reins in Ecuador. He eliminated presidential term limits, intimidated and ejected judges, and sent henchmen to follow and attack political opponents and activists, like Mr. Pazmi\u00f1o and Ms. Rold\u00f3s.\n\nHis government also turned to ECU-911.\n\n\"I think few people know about it or are actually aware of the huge power of ECU-911,\" Ms. Rold\u00f3s said. \"There are few people who really know the extent of the tracking.\" She added that Senain used just about any technology it could get its hands on to harass and follow Mr. Correa's political opponents.\n\nA seasoned intelligence officer, Mr. Pazmi\u00f1o, 59, said even he was surprised when, in 2013, a video camera that was part of ECU-911 was installed directly outside his house. It hung from a pole on a traffic divider in the middle of the street, with a full view through a window into his second-story apartment.\n\n\"There is a direct collaboration between ECU-911, the Intelligence Secretariat and also those who surveil and persecute political or social actors,\" said Mr. Pazmi\u00f1o, citing his own experience, as well as documents and people who had worked in Senain.\n\nMr. Pazmi\u00f1o said that after the camera went in, surveillance teams following him backed off. The camera otherwise made no real sense where it was. Mr. Pazmi\u00f1o lives in a relatively safe neighborhood, and no other ECU-911 cameras were installed nearby. It was a move out of the police playbook in China, where cameras are positioned outside the doors of high-profile activists.\n\nA visit to Senain's headquarters confirmed Mr. Pazmi\u00f1o's suspicion. On a wall of screens that served as a sort of agency control room, Times reporters recognized footage from the ECU-911 system.\n\nMr. Costa, who was in charge of the transition between Senain and its successor, acknowledged the transmissions -- but said he was not responsible for how they had been used in Mr. Correa's administration.\n\nMr. Pazmi\u00f1o said he had an idea of who should be held accountable: China. He said the country had supported and emboldened Mr. Correa, just as it had leaders in neighboring Venezuela. As conditions deteriorated in Venezuela last year, Huawei engineers helped train Venezuelan engineers on how to maintain their version of Ecuador's system.\n\n\"I believe what the Chinese model generates is control over society,\" he said. \"A rigid control.\"\n\nTHE LIMITS OF SURVEILLANCE\n\nEl Tejar has some of the best views in Quito -- and some of its worst crime.\n\nAs Lidia Rueda, a community organizer, walked the steep, winding streets of this neighborhood, where she has lived for 30 years, she pointed down the hill to where the bodies of several murdered women were found. Drug dealers come and go with impunity, she said. Muggings are common. Thieves break streetlights to get the cover of darkness.\n\nThe crime has not subsided even though ECU-911 cameras arrived at the base of the hill several years ago. Ms. Rueda gestured to a pedestrian bridge there, where one man had grabbed her and threatened her with a knife while another had taken her money. The 2014 mugging happened directly beneath a police camera. No help came.\n\nMs. Rueda's experience encapsulates the complex relationship many Ecuadoreans have with the cameras. While the authorities said the cameras had reduced crime, anecdotes of its dysfunction abound.\n\n\"Where there are cameras, they often don't work,\" said Ms. Rueda, 61. Another possibility was simply that no one was watching.\n\nThe odds are against Ecuador's police force. Quito has more than 800 cameras. But during a Times visit, 30 police officers were on duty to check the footage. In their gray building atop the hill, officers spend a few minutes looking at footage from one camera and then switch. Preventing crime is only part of the job. In a control room, dispatchers supported responses to emergency calls.\n\nMost of the time, no one was on the other side of the lens.\n\nIt was a reminder that the system, and others like it, are more easily used for snooping than crime prevention. Following someone on the streets requires a small team, while large numbers of well-coordinated police are necessary to stop crime.\n\nMr. Robayo argued that ECU-911 had been responsible for a major drop in murders and an almost 13 percent drop in crime in 2018 from the previous year. The mere existence of a camera can also have a profound effect, he said.\n\nMany Ecuadoreans agree. Despite Ms. Rueda's mugging, she has called for the installation of more cameras in El Tejar. The best way to fix the neighborhood's crime problems is to fix the surveillance system, she said.\n\nThe police have told her that the cameras are too expensive for her neighborhood. To that, Ms. Rueda took a fatalistic view.\n\n\"It is always the same problem, a budget shortage,\" she said. \"Only when someone is killed, then the authorities come and say, 'Now we're going to do it.'\"\n\nInterested in All Things Tech?

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images) By Griff Witte and Griff Witte Europe-focused correspondent with extensive experience in the Middle East and South Asia Luisa Beck Luisa Beck Reporter covering Europe from The Washington Post's Berlin bureau April 23 at 5:00 AM\n\nTANGERH\u00dcTTE, GERMANY -- In a hollowed-out East German town where the factories closed long ago and the population dwindles with every death notice, Andreas Brohm sees the makings of a renaissance.\n\nTangerh\u00fctte could be a hub for wind energy. A center for server farms. A magnet for young professionals, like himself, who yearn for wide-open spaces to raise their kids, far from the cost and craze of life in the big city.\n\nIf only residents could get a decent cellphone signal.\n\n\"As the mayor of this town, I need communications. I need 5G,\" said Brohm, 40, in an interview at the town's century-old, red-brick town hall, where Internet connections are spotty. \"I don't care who provides it.\"\n\nBut the Trump administration does care.\n\nConcerned about the potential for cyberespionage, or even sabotage, the United States last month took the extraordinary step of telling the German government not to include the Chinese firm Huawei in its plans to roll out the next generation of Internet technology. If Germany ignores the advice, officials have warned, U.S. intelligence sharing could be at stake.\n\nExcluding Huawei carries its own risks. Service providers say that without the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, building a 5G network will cost far more and take years longer. In the places that need it most -- the towns and villages of the German countryside -- the promise of a digital revolution that could spawn a 21st-century revival may never be realized.\n\nThe collision of those concerns helps explain why Germany's decision on Huawei has proved so agonizing. For now, the government has avoided making one: It has declined to ban the firm outright, while setting what officials say is a high-enough standard for security that Huawei may struggle to clear it.\n\nBut ultimately, Germany -- along with governments across Europe -- will have to choose. And either way, there are likely to be significant costs.\n\nThe hit for Germany from a delayed 5G rollout could be especially acute.\n\nHuawei technology is already deeply embedded in Europe's communications networks, and German telecom companies fear they won't be able to deploy 5G without the help of the Chinese firm. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nAlthough the country is the undisputed economic titan of Europe, it is also a digital laggard. Germany has some of the lowest penetration rates for fiber-optic broadband among industrialized nations. A study last year revealed that people get speedier surfing on their phones in Albania than they do in Germany. Outside the big cities such as Berlin, Hamburg and Munich -- and sometimes even within them -- service is patchy at best.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel has said the country needs to scale up its digital performance or face a dire economic reckoning. \"Our future prosperity depends on it,\" she has told audiences.\n\nA rapid and comprehensive rollout of 5G -- thereby leapfrogging the anemic deployment of 4G technologies -- is seen by experts as the country's best hope to catch up to its peers and to help close the growing prosperity gap between urban and rural areas.\n\nThe first step in that push comes this spring, with the auctioning of 5G spectrum licenses. All of Germany's major telecommunications providers are bidding.\n\nBut they warn that they won't be able to deploy the new network -- billed as an exponential jump in connectivity that will open the door to autonomous vehicles, remote surgery and other transformational uses of technology -- without help from Huawei.\n\nExcluding the firm would be \"hugely disruptive,\" adding costs and delays that could set the project back years, Vodafone chief executive Nick Read told the Mobile World Congress in February.\n\n\"It structurally disadvantages Europe,\" he said.\n\nHuawei technology is already deeply embedded in European communications networks, with its stamp on everything from handheld devices to transmission towers.\n\nAn insistence that the firm's products play no role in 5G would mean that \"companies have to focus on removing technology from the network rather than building it out,\" said Nick Kriegeskotte, head of telecommunication policy with Bitkom, an industry trade group.\n\nThat's one reason Kriegeskotte doesn't expect Huawei, or any other major 5G technology maker, to be left out.\n\nMayor Andreas Brohm sees improving connection speeds and cellular reception as the keys to his area's economic revival. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nBut picking providers that include Huawei in their plans would further roil an already turbulent transatlantic relationship. U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell put Germany on notice last month with a letter to the economy ministry laying out a case for why the United States may not be able to continue sharing sensitive information if it doesn't feel it can trust the integrity of German communication networks.\n\n\"This could in the future jeopardize nimble cooperation and joint mobilization, particularly in times of crisis,\" the embassy said in a statement.\n\nGermany and other European allies rely heavily on U.S. intelligence, and any disruption to the sharing of sensitive information could be debilitating.\n\nGerman officials privately scoff at the U.S. threats, saying they don't believe the United States would actually curtail intelligence cooperation that is mutually beneficial.\n\nBut apart from the U.S. pressure, German security officials and experts say there is good reason to be wary of Huawei. The firm, they say, can't be trusted not to take part in surveillance or spying on behalf of the Chinese government, and a crucial role for the company in German communications networks could become leverage for China in geopolitics.\n\nWhen those factors are taken into account, said Free University Berlin computer science professor Matthias Waehlisch, Huawei's technology looks like much less of a bargain than the sticker price on its products would suggest.\n\n\"It's not only the money you pay for the equipment,\" he said.\n\nHuawei has mounted an aggressive campaign to rebut suggestions that it represents a security threat. In Bonn -- the old capital of West Germany and still home to numerous German federal agencies -- the company has set up a demonstration center where regulators can review the firm's source code.\n\nHuawei has also sent lobbyists to meet with lawmakers, though they have not always been convincing. Daniela Kluckert, a member of the German parliament with the pro-business Free Democrats, said that even after hearing the firm's pitch, she thinks Germany needs to be careful.\n\n\"It's more important to be safe than to have 5G cheaper and faster,\" she said.\n\nIn Tangerh\u00fctte, getting faster Internet is a matter of survival. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nBut Kluckert, who sits on a key committee with oversight of the 5G rollout, also said it is hard to overstate just how much Germany needs a tech upgrade -- particularly outside the big cities.\n\nIn Tangerh\u00fctte, a town of modest red-roofed buildings set amid endless green pastures 75 miles west of Berlin, getting faster Internet has become a matter of survival.\n\nThe town of nearly 11,000 has lost a third of its population in recent decades, as employers shuttered operations and young people sought better opportunities in bigger locales.\n\nBrohm, the mayor, initially was among those who left. He lived and worked across Europe, ending up in Berlin pursuing a career in musical theater.\n\nBut as rent climbed and Brohm's family grew to include three children, he wanted a return to the easier living and tightknit community of his youth. He proposed a move back to Tangerh\u00fctte, and his wife was receptive -- to a point.\n\n\"She said, 'If we can't have Internet in our home, I won't go with you,'\u2009\" Brohm recalled. \"People today can live without an opera house, a cinema, a concert hall. But they can't live without energy, water and broadband. The door to the world is the Internet.\"\n\nAs mayor, Brohm has led a crusade to improve connection speeds and cellular reception, believing those are the keys to the area's economic revival.\n\nThomas Krone, whose company makes metal fencing, says the region's poor digital infrastructure is preventing his business from growing. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nThomas Krone's experience shows why: The third-generation owner of a Tangerh\u00fctte manufacturing firm that dates to 1923, he sells metal fencing used in factories the world over. And he still does it much the way his grandfather did, by hand.\n\nWith faster Internet, he has dreams of expansion: an online shop, or maybe an automated production process.\n\nBut without an upgrade, Krone, 53, isn't sure there will be anything left to pass on to his kids. Clients are demanding ever-more-sophisticated practices, using 3-D designs, that just aren't possible when poor network connections make basic downloads an all-afternoon affair.\n\n\"We're in nowhere land,\" Krone said, motioning to the farmers' fields that encircle his warehouselike shop floor. \"It's not going to be possible to maintain this business without Internet.\"\n\nRead more\n\nHow China's Huawei took the lead over U.S. companies in 5G technology\n\nBritish spy agency delivers scathing assessment of security risks posed by Huawei to U.K. telecom networks\n\nU.S. officials planning for a future in which Huawei has a major share of 5G global networks\n\nThe Post's View: U.S. allies should heed the warnings about Huawei", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zi-usPexwHdpUNSPg2PTNwrPJ-w=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5PIIAIS5H4I6TGGUQRAIRUJV6I.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-4743245", "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 293707380}, {"body": "Huawei Technologies Co. has begun to feel the effects of U.S. moves to curb its access to U.S. technology, as Google cut access to some of its Android services on Huawei smartphones and a German chip supplier said it was cutting deliveries to the Chinese giant.\n\nAlphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOG -0.64% Google will restrict access to certain Android features to comply with a U.S. requirement that suppliers seek licenses to keep selling to Huawei, according to people familiar with the matter, a sign that the measures may bite into Huawei\u2019s booming consumer-device business.\n\nHuawei, which recently surpassed Apple Inc. as the world\u2019s No. 2 supplier of smartphones\u2014it now trails only Samsung Electronics Co. \u2014relies on Google\u2019s Android operating system to run its devices.\n\nFrom now, Huawei will be able to use only the public version of Android and won\u2019t have access to proprietary apps and services from Google, according to a person familiar with the matter. Though existing phones are expected to keep functioning largely as usual for now, users could lose some app functions, including some artificial-intelligence and photography features, the person said.\n\nIn a separate move, German chip maker Infineon Technologies AG said it was terminating the delivery to Huawei of some components originating in the U.S., in a sign that even non-U.S. suppliers to Huawei are being swept up in the U.S. trade restrictions. Infineon didn\u2019t specify which components were affected by the action but said the \u201cgreat majority\u201d of products it sells to Huawei aren\u2019t subject to trade restrictions.\n\nSeparately, Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, has suspended shipments to Huawei of its chips, and some employees have been told not to communicate with the Huawei side, according to a separate person familiar with the matter. Qualcomm chipsets are used in certain Huawei smartphone models. Huawei also designs a large number of its own chips for higher-end phones.\n\nLumentum Holdings Inc., which makes optical components for smartphones, said it was stopping shipments to Huawei. In fiscal 2018, the company generated about 11% of its revenue from sales to Huawei.\n\nLumentum altered its fiscal fourth-quarter guidance to reflect the halt, now expecting revenue of between $375 million and $390 million, down from a range of between $405 million and $425 million. It expects adjusted per-share profit of 65 cents to 77 cents, down from 85 cents to $1.\n\nXilinx Inc. said it also has begun complying with the Trump administration\u2019s order. The ban on shipments to Huawei could shave about $300 million off the chip maker\u2019s annual revenue for the calendar year, Christopher Rolland, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group, wrote in a research note. Xilinx is expected to record $3.43 billion of revenue this year, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.\n\nLast week the U.S. Commerce Department said it was adding Huawei to its \u201centity list\u201d on national-security grounds, requiring companies that export U.S. technology to the Chinese company to apply for a license. The department has indicated applications are likely to be denied, which would cut Huawei off from a range of crucial American suppliers.\n\nHuawei, the world\u2019s biggest maker of telecommunications gear draws upon suppliers from around the world, but it relies on American companies to supply certain components that go into its smartphones, cellular base stations and other products.\n\nHuawei\u2019s founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei, told reporters Saturday that the impact on smartphone production would be limited even if Huawei cannot import chips, according to a spokeswoman who confirmed his remarks. Mr. Ren also said the company would stick to an earlier forecast that its annual revenue growth would be under 20%.\n\nA Huawei spokesman said the company would continue providing security updates and after-sales services to existing Huawei smartphone and tablets, \u201ccovering those that have been sold and that are still in stock globally.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs one of Android\u2019s key global partners, we have worked closely with their open-source platform to develop an ecosystem that has benefited both users and the industry,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nMelissa Chau, an analyst at IDC, said: \u201cGoogle apps are incredibly important to a company like Huawei, which is deeply reliant on smartphone shipments outside of China, and representing half of its global shipment figure.\u201d She said it was of \u201ccritical importance to have this resolved as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nA Google spokesman said the company was \u201ccomplying with the order and reviewing the implications.\u201d The spokesman added that many Android functions would continue running as normal, including access to the Google Play app-store service and security protections from Google Play Protect. Reuters first reported the halt by Google.\n\nGoogle\u2019s standard suite of apps, like Google Maps and Gmail, would continue to function normally, according to a person familiar with the matter. However, Huawei phones might lose other Google services as part of U.S. government action, this person said. Proprietary apps and services such as some artificial-intelligence capabilities that connect to Google infrastructure might cease to function, according to this person.\n\nHuawei\u2019s global smartphone shipments rose 50% in the first quarter, bucking an industrywide decline of 6.7%, according to research firm International Data Corp. The consumer-business group last year became the biggest source of revenue for the Shenzhen-based technology giant, outpacing revenue from its carrier customers for the first time. Last year, consumer sales including smartphones, laptops and other gadgets accounted for 48% of Huawei\u2019s $107 billion in revenue.\n\nHuawei\u2019s smartphone growth has been fueled largely by sales in Europe and China.
