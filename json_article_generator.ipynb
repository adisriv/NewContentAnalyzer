    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "An executive at the investment giant TPG who was charged in a huge college admissions scandal introduced colleagues on the firm’s deal team to the scheme’s ringleader, but nothing came of the business discussions, TPG said on Thursday.\n",
    "\n",
    "TPG also said it planned to strip the executive, William E. McGlashan Jr., of most of the profits he was due from funds he oversaw.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disclosures, in a memorandum to employees, followed an internal investigation into Mr. McGlashan, whom TPG said it had fired last month after he was implicated in the admissions scheme. (Mr. McGlashan has insisted that he resigned before he was fired.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Federal prosecutors have accused Mr. McGlashan, one of TPG’s biggest stars and a powerful Silicon Valley investor, with paying $50,000 to a charity run by the businessman William Singer in exchange for getting his son extra time to complete a college-entrance exam. He is also accused of agreeing to pay $250,000 to ensure his son’s admission to the University of Southern California as a football recruit, although prosecutors have said he did not follow through with that scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lawyers for Mr. McGlashan have indicated that he plans to fight the charges of money laundering and fraud against him. A representative for Mr. McGlashan did not have an immediate comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the memo, TPG, which has more than $103 billion under management, said Mr. McGlashan had met with Mr. Singer in early 2017, and then introduced him to colleagues to discuss potential business ideas. The introduction was made before the admissions fraud that federal prosecutors say Mr. McGlashan participated in, according to the firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TPG deal team quickly decided against working with Mr. Singer, the memo said. Two other TPG employees did hire Mr. Singer, but for what the firm described as legitimate college-counseling services.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We are confident that the process and deal team worked as they should, free from any undue influence by Mr. McGlashan or knowledge of unethical or criminal behavior in Mr. Singer’s businesses,” a TPG spokesman said in a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "TPG also said in the memo that it had determined the financial terms of Mr. McGlashan’s severance based on the documents governing its funds. He will lose all profits he would be owed from the firm’s Growth and Rise funds — potentially millions of dollars — but will retain any stake in the firm itself that had already vested. The Growth fund has invested in technology darlings like Uber.\n",

    "article['title'] = \"A Mystery Solved in the College Admissions Scandal: The Family Who Paid $1.2 Million\"\n",
    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "One of the mysteries of the sweeping college admissions fraud case has been over the families that prosecutors say paid the biggest sums to a college consultant at the center of the schemes but that have not been charged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 33 parents charged in the scandal are mostly accused of paying the consultant, William Singer, either tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to facilitate cheating on admissions tests or to bribe coaches or other officials so that their children could be admitted to schools as recruited athletes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the prosecutors leading the largest-ever college admissions prosecution have also alluded to other families, not named and not charged, who paid far more. One family paid Mr. Singer $6.5 million to get their child into college through the recruitment scheme, the prosecutors have said. Another was described in court documents as having paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million in connection with their daughter’s application to Yale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors said that the daughter, whom they called Yale Applicant 1 in court documents, was admitted to Yale as a recruit for the women’s soccer team, despite not being a competitive soccer player. According to documents charging Rudolph Meredith, the former women’s soccer coach at Yale, Mr. Singer had paid Mr. Meredith a bribe to designate the young woman as a recruit for the team. Mr. Singer has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges, and Mr. Meredith has pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Friday, Yale Applicant 1 was finally identified: She is Sherry Guo, a young woman from China who moved to Southern California for high school, and who was a freshman at Yale until last month, according to her lawyer, James Spertus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Guo’s identity was first reported on Friday by The Wall Street Journal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A spokeswoman for the United States attorney’s office in Boston, Christina Sterling, declined to comment on Ms. Guo’s case. Asked why Ms. Guo and her parents — as well as the still unidentified family that was said to have paid Mr. Singer $6.5 million — have not been charged in the case, she said, “I cannot comment other than to say it is an ongoing investigation.”\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the charges against Mr. Meredith, Ms. Guo and her family were introduced to Mr. Singer in 2017 by a financial adviser based in Los Angeles. An employee of the financial adviser sent Mr. Singer an email “stating that Yale Applicant 1’s father wished to make a ‘donation’ to ‘one of those top schools for his daughter’s ‘application,’” the charging documents said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer promptly sent Ms. Guo’s résumé and personal statement to Mr. Meredith, the soccer coach, according to the charging documents. Her personal statement contained links to her art portfolio; Mr. Singer told Mr. Meredith he would “revise” the materials to “soccer.” A few days later, he sent Mr. Meredith an athletic profile that falsely described Ms. Guo as the co-captain of a prominent club soccer team in Southern California. Mr. Meredith then designated her as a recruit for the soccer team.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the charging documents, Mr. Singer mailed Mr. Meredith a check for $400,000 in 2018, and later that year, Ms. Guo’s relatives paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million in several installments, $900,000 of which was sent to a nonprofit foundation Mr. Singer had set up, and which prosecutors argue was used to hide much of Mr. Singer’s and his clients’ illicit activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Spertus said that Ms. Guo and her parents did not know that the payment was going toward a bribe. Her parents did not speak English and were not in direct contact with Mr. Singer, he said, while Ms. Guo herself was naïve about how the college admissions process worked in the United States. (Mr. Spertus would not identify Ms. Guo’s parents.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Guo wanted to go to Columbia University or Oxford, Mr. Spertus said, but Mr. Singer told her to apply to Yale, and that she would be guaranteed to get in. While that might have seemed strange to a student who grew up in the United States, he said, Ms. Guo did not expect to have much choice about where to go to college.\n",
    "\n",
    "“She wasn’t working with Singer to find the best school for her,” he said. “She is now devastated because she is no longer in college, period.” Yale has said that it rescinded the admission of one student in connection with the case, but has not identified the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "He said that Ms. Guo was not copied on either of the emails that Mr. Singer sent to Mr. Meredith suggesting that her college credentials be falsified to say she played soccer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Spertus said the large size of the payment suggested that Mr. Singer was exploiting Ms. Guo’s family and their lack of knowledge about the college process.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The amount alone shows that he was preying on the Chinese community,” he said. “The donation was made to help underprivileged youth. They were not aware that the money went to Meredith. They did not know that he was going to use that money for a bribe. There is no evidence of that whatsoever.”\n",

    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "After 50 people, including parents and coaches, were charged last month with crimes, the nation’s largest-ever college admissions prosecution appeared to be ensnaring another group — students.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a lawyer involved in the case, at least some children of the parents who were charged in the scandal have received so-called target letters, which notify people that they could be targets of a criminal probe. The lawyer declined to be quoted by name, citing sensitivities about the ongoing case. A spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor’s office in Boston, which is handling the case, declined to comment on the development, which was previously reported in Law360, a legal news service, and The Wall Street Journal.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was uncertain on Monday how many students received such target letters or whether they would, in fact, lead to additional charges. Several defense lawyers in the case said the children of their clients — parents charged with trying to get their children admitted to college with falsified athletic credentials or altered test scores — had not received such letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Federal prosecutors have said that some of the young people involved in the case were oblivious to what their parents were doing, while others were not. “At times, the students were in on it,” a federal prosecutor, Eric S. Rosen, said in court last week during one in a long schedule of hearings in the sprawling case.\n",
    "\n",
    "More than a dozen parents, including the actress Lori Loughlin, have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them, court documents showed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Loughlin’s not guilty plea on Monday came a week after 13 other parents, including the actress Felicity Huffman, indicated that they would plead guilty. The decisions by Ms. Loughlin and Ms. Huffman, the most widely known parents involved in the case, were only the latest way in which their legal paths have diverged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Loughlin waived her right to appear in court for an arraignment after being indicted last week on a count of conspiracy to commit fraud and another of money laundering conspiracy. Her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, also entered a not guilty plea to the same charges, documents showed.\n",

    "article['title'] = \"His Father Paid $400,000 to Get Him Into Georgetown. Now He’s Suing the School.\"\n",
    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "Georgetown University said Wednesday that it planned to dismiss two students connected to the college admissions scandal. Just hours earlier, one of those students, Adam Semprevivo, whose father has pleaded guilty in the case, sued Georgetown for threatening to expel him, saying that the university had denied him due process and that it should have been aware of misrepresentations on his application long before the Justice Department announced charges in the nation’s largest college admissions prosecution earlier this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Georgetown did not identify either student, but Mr. Semprevivo’s lawyer, David Kenner, said he had received an email from Georgetown informing him that his admission had been rescinded and that he would be dismissed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Semprevivo, 21, who is from Los Angeles, just finished his junior year at the college in Washington, D.C. His father, Stephen Semprevivo, pleaded guilty last week to paying a college consultant $400,000 to secure his son’s admission to Georgetown as a recruit to the tennis team, even though the son did not play tennis competitively. According to the lawsuit, Adam has a 3.18 grade point average in college so far. He has not been charged in the case, nor have any other students, though several have received target letters from prosecutors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Kenner said that dismissal was too harsh a punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It’s a life sentence,” he said. “He’s lost three years of his life, studying, getting good grades, doing everything that was expected of him.” He added it could be difficult for Mr. Semprevivo to gain admission to another college and that the dismissal could also affect his job prospects. “Potentially this will follow him for the rest of his life.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The lawsuit — which appears to be the first case of a student suing over discipline imposed as a result of the scandal — underscores the complicated position that universities find themselves in as they try to figure out what action, if any, to take against students connected to the case. Some students appear to have been oblivious to their parents’ illicit efforts to get them into elite colleges, while others were aware, according to documents in the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some answers to important questions about the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors say that Georgetown’s former tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, took $2.7 million in bribes from the college counselor at the center of the case, William Singer, between 2012 and 2018. In exchange for the bribes, according to prosecutors, Mr. Ernst designated at least 12 of the children of Mr. Singer’s clients as recruits to the tennis team, ensuring their admission to Georgetown, one of eight colleges — including Yale, Stanford, and the University of Southern California — where prosecutors say the scheme played out. Mr. Ernst has been charged with conspiracy to commit racketeering and has pleaded not guilty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The charging documents specifically mention five parents or sets of parents whose children prosecutors say were designated by Mr. Ernst as recruits to the Georgetown tennis team. In four of those cases, prosecutors say the students’ applications included fabrications about their supposed tennis accomplishments. One student appears to have actually played tennis in high school, but not at Georgetown. Two of the students have already graduated.\n",
    "\n",
    "More than a year before federal authorities announced charges in the wide-reaching scandal, Georgetown knew of problems with Mr. Ernst’s recruiting practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017, the admissions office discovered what a spokeswoman called “irregularities in the athletic and other credentials” of two students being recruited by Mr. Ernst to play tennis. The university placed Mr. Ernst on leave and began an internal investigation, which found that he had violated university rules concerning admissions. The university asked him to resign in 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Ernst went on to get a job as the head coach of women’s tennis at the University of Rhode Island. Georgetown has said that it knew nothing about the bribes described by prosecutors and did not find any criminal activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Georgetown gave few details about its investigation of the students. In a statement, a spokeswoman said that, after the charges were brought in the case earlier this year, the university began a review focused on whether any students knowingly provided false information to the university when they applied for admission.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Each student case was addressed individually and each student was given multiple opportunities to respond and provide information to the University,” the spokeswoman, Meghan Dubyak, said in an email.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Semprevivo’s lawsuit sheds a little more light. It says that Mr. Semprevivo first learned he was being investigated in April, through an email from a university official. It says that he was later sent a letter with a list of 29 questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two months after charges in the admissions scandal were first announced, some colleges have taken steps to remove students while others appear to be still sorting through what to do. Yale and Stanford have each rescinded the admission of one student. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the University of Southern California, roughly two dozen students were being investigated through the student judicial affairs committee. The total number of current students being investigated or who have been investigated at schools around the country is most likely 30 or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was not immediately clear why some schools have moved quickly while others have taken more time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not clear what Adam Semprevivo knew about the admissions scheme, though he did send an email to Mr. Ernst — drafted by Mr. Singer — with false statements about his tennis experience, and he received an email from Mr. Singer with an essay intended for his Georgetown application that also contained false statements, according to both the charging documents and the lawsuit. His application to Georgetown also listed other fabricated tennis credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lawsuit says that Mr. Singer told Mr. Semprevivo that Mr. Ernst was a friend and would provide a recommendation for him during the admissions process. It also says that Mr. Singer submitted Mr. Semprevivo’s application and typed his name in the signature block. Students are required to sign their applications to affirm that the information in their application is accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Kenner, the lawyer, said that Mr. Singer had worked with Mr. Semprevivo for over a year — coming to his house every two or three weeks to tutor and advise him — and gained his trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "“He took over the process,” he said of Mr. Singer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another current student whose parents have been charged in the case also seems to have been at least somewhat aware, according to the charging documents. Prosecutors have said that Elizabeth and Manuel Henriquez, a couple from Atherton, Calif., paid Mr. Singer $400,000 to bribe Mr. Ernst to designate their elder daughter, Isabelle, as a recruit to the tennis team. Additionally, according to prosecutors, the Henriquezes paid Mr. Singer at least $50,000 to arrange for cheating on the SAT, ACT and SAT subject tests for Isabelle and her younger sister. The Henriquezes have pleaded not guilty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Adam Semprevivo, Isabelle Henriquez also sent an email to Mr. Ernst that was drafted by Mr. Singer, with fabrications about her tennis experience, according to documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors have said that Ms. Henriquez actively participated in the test cheating scheme. According to the charging documents, Mr. Singer arranged for an SAT expert to proctor her SAT in exchange for a bribe. The proctor, Mark Riddell, who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering and is cooperating with the investigation, told investigators that he had sat next to Ms. Henriquez during the exam and provided her answers, according to the criminal complaint. Afterward, he said, he “gloated” with Ms. Henriquez and her mother “about the fact that they had cheated and gotten away with it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Henriquez and representatives for her parents did not respond to messages asking if her admission had been rescinded.\n",
    "\n",
    "A handful of children whose parents are accused of bribery have received their degrees. It is unclear how, if at all, schools could discipline those students. While some colleges have revoked degrees in the past for plagiarism, for example, such a move would most likely open up universities to lawsuits, particularly as the students have earned the credits for courses they successfully completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Dubyak, the Georgetown spokeswoman, said the university’s review process had focused first on current students, but would still look at students who had graduated.\n",

    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "Felicity Huffman, the Hollywood actress, on Monday laid out a list of failings: Yes, she had paid a college counselor $15,000 to arrange for cheating on her daughter’s SAT test. And yes, it had backfired miserably, turning what Ms. Huffman said had been an effort to help her daughter into a betrayal of her.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am ashamed,” Ms. Huffman said, announcing that she will plead guilty to a federal crime, part of a sweeping investigation of college admissions fraud unveiled last month by prosecutors in Boston.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the statement issued by Ms. Huffman, she said she wanted to apologize to her family, friends and colleagues, and especially, she said, “to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Huffman was one of 50 people charged in a sweeping investigation of college admissions fraud unveiled last month by federal prosecutors in Boston. On Monday, prosecutors said that 14 people — 13 parents and one coach — would plead guilty in the case. Dates for the formal pleas in court had yet to be set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Huffman said that her daughter had been unaware of the cheating — prosecutors say a proctor corrected her test answers after she had left. And Ms. Huffman acknowledged that, in an attempt to assist her daughter, she had ultimately hurt and betrayed her.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life,” she said. “My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The case prosecutors have laid out centers on a college consultant, William Singer, whom Ms. Huffman and the other parents hired to guide them through the application process. According to prosecutors, Mr. Singer specialized in boosting students’ chances through fraud: He bribed test administrators to allow cheating on college entrance exams and bribed college coaches to designate his clients’ children as recruits to teams for which they were not actually qualified. Mr. Singer cooperated with prosecutors and has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "A total of 33 parents were charged in the case. Some have made clear they will fight the charges, while others may still be debating what to do. Ms. Huffman is the highest-profile parent to admit wrongdoing in the case so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, were also charged and were not among those who prosecutors said on Monday would plead guilty. The government has said that the couple conspired with Mr. Singer to pay $500,000 in bribes to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as recruits to the women’s crew team, even though neither actually rowed crew. Ms. Loughlin has lost some professional opportunities as a result of the charges — most notably, the Hallmark Channel said that it would stop development of shows that feature her.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not clear what impact Ms. Huffman’s acknowledgment of guilt will have on her career. She has roles in several coming movies and television series, including playing the prosecutor Linda Fairstein in the mini-series “When They See Us” about the so-called Central Park Five, five black and Hispanic teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of beating and raping a female jogger in Central Park in 1989.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors said that Ms. Huffman and most of the other parents would plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, but it is unclear how much time, if any, Ms. Huffman and the other parents will receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their sentences may be affected in part by how much money each is alleged to have paid to Mr. Singer and others as part of the scheme. Ms. Huffman’s payment of $15,000 was among the smallest, according to court documents. Ms. Huffman’s and the 12 other parents’ sentences are also likely to be lighter as a result of their pleading guilty and not making the government go to trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the parents, prosecutors said on Monday that one of several coaches charged in the case, Michael Center, the former head coach of men’s tennis at the University of Texas at Austin, would also plead guilty to the same crime. Prosecutors said that Mr. Singer paid Mr. Center $60,000 in cash and directed $40,000 to the University of Texas tennis program in exchange for Mr. Center designating the son of one of Mr. Singer’s clients as a recruit for the tennis team, even though he was not a competitive tennis player and did not ultimately play on the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two parents, Bruce and Davina Isackson of Hillsborough, Calif., have also agreed to cooperate, prosecutors said. The Isacksons were accused of paying Mr. Singer $600,000 to bribe athletics officials in order to secure their two daughters’ admission to U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. as athletic recruits, and to cheat on their younger daughter’s ACT.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the criminal complaint against Ms. Huffman, her husband, William H. Macy, was also involved in the $15,000 payment to Mr. Singer. For reasons that are unclear, Mr. Macy was not charged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of students who have been punished as a result of the investigation is also growing. Last week, Stanford announced that it had expelled a student who had falsely claimed in her application to be a competitive sailor and had vacated the credits that she had already accumulated. The student’s name has not been made public. The former Stanford sailing coach, John Vandemoer, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering and has acknowledged accepting donations to his sailing program from Mr. Singer in exchange for agreeing to use recruiting slots for Mr. Singer’s clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The student whom Stanford expelled, the daughter of a client of Mr. Singer’s, was not actually recruited as a sailor, but after she was admitted, Mr. Singer directed $500,000 to Stanford’s sailing program.\n",

Wealthy, well-known parents are accused of paying to open “side doors” for their children to enter schools including Yale, Stanford and Georgetown.\n",

Then there are the taxpayers, who contribute to funding higher education and expect their dollars to be used fairly.\n",

This practice, at a public university no less, gave places to students known to be underqualified as admissions officers complained in vain.\n",

She pitched products as an Instagram influencer and pouted about college on social media. “It’s so hard to try in school when you don’t care about anything you’re learning,” she posted.\n",
    "\n",
    "What a stick in the weary eye of any diligent student who sweated over an admissions essay and deserved an honest shot at admittance at a time when USC was crowing about its declining acceptance rate. Just 13 percent of students who applied won a spot in 2018 as “a landslide of outstanding applications (raised) the bar for admits,” it said on its website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitive college admissions is a zero-sum game. There are only so many spots available, so for each cheater, a worthy student is displaced. And for every revelation of clout or cheating, untold numbers of young people get the message that merit doesn’t matter, only money. Why strive in a rigged system?\n",
    "\n",
    "Students from disadvantaged backgrounds already know they’re competing against peers who have every benefit — from healthy food, homework help and enriching vacations to freedom from worries about side jobs and student loan debt. Those who believe all young people deserve an opportunity to succeed in life should support rooting out the corruption and favoritism that hurts families who attempt to compete on the merits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any parent convicted in this scheme has done harm to the public, other students and their own children, too — by corrupting the notion of achievement. Here’s a lesson for the ages, and we offer it for free: The bought trophy never satisfies.\n",

    "Aunt Becky … why did you do it? You did a disservice to your children. A disservice that will extend beyond the legal trouble you’re in. The biggest misstep? That your kids think you don’t have faith in their abilities to make their own way without your ongoing interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lori Loughlin has forged an acting career as a wholesome, girl-next-door mainstay — one anchored on “Full House” as Rebecca Donaldson. But Loughlin has sabotaged that goodness forever. True, it was done while running to the aid of her children. But at the cost of $500,000?\n",
    "\n",
    "Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannuli, were among the celebrities and CEOs charged with bribing and cheating to get their kids into elite schools, including Yale, Georgetown and the University of Southern California. Loughlin was released on $1 million bond after being taken into FBI custody in Los Angeles on March 13. So many questions surround the scandal, including whether the children knew about what occurred before the FBI got involved. If you’re a person with college loan debt, the frustration is real. Investigations like this only feed the conspiracy theorist in all of us.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the lingering issue in this scandal is the negative message that parents — even with the best intentions — send their offspring. The most injured parties in this are the children. For parents not to believe in their child’s skills, prowess, creativity and persistence to the point that they need to pay to ensure success is guaranteed? Whoa. That would destroy some children.\n",
    "\n",
    "“A lot of parents seem to lack confidence in their kids — that their kids can step up and manage on their own and work hard and achieve and succeed on their own. And I think that has a real impact on kids — to feel on some level their parents don’t necessarily have faith in them,” says Dr. Paul Donahue, a clinical psychologist based in Scarsdale, N.Y. “I think there are some parents that really worry that their job is to help their kids avoid frustration or disappointment or not have any painful experiences, and that’s not really our job as parents. Our job is to create situations where our kids can work hard and they can sustain themselves, even when they are facing adversity. It’s back to that idea of faith and confidence that the kids are going to be OK, and one school or college admission is not going to define who they are.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Donahue, author of the book “Parenting Without Fear,” says there’s been a shift from values to achievements (kids’ grades, test scores, athleticism and popularity), resulting in young people feeling that their self-worth is based on said achievements, as opposed to the kind of person they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the news came to light, it was as if Loughlin, Felicity Huffman and others had written in permanent marker for the world to see, “As parents, we don’t believe in our children.” Parents know their children and their capabilities whether they articulate them or not. But to put out that doubt in such a public way is unconscionable. Are we, as a society, so afraid of failure that risking jail time is a tenable argument? If so, we need to have a class called Enabler 101 taught early and frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re all trying to figure out life, and we do that by failure, success, reaching, missing, getting scarred and putting a Band-Aid on to do it again with more experience. Limitations are learned, morals are set, mettle is determined in each instance. Lost potential is one thing when it’s children making the missteps. But when parents use cold, hard cash to confirm secretly held fears that their kids are not good enough, what is there left to say?\n",
    "\n",
    "Donahue thinks this incident is an opportunity for people to pause and reflect on how parents stepping in to make life easier for their children is affecting kids.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What we see in some of the kids who get into elite schools is that they’re great at getting good grades, taking tests and doing what they’re supposed to do, but in terms of managing their life, dealing with disappointment, dealing with frustration, handling challenges, kids aren’t necessarily great at that,” Donahue says. “And ultimately, what’s going to define successful people and people who do well in different phases of their life is going to be how resilient you are.”\n",

    "\n",
    "Mark Riddell admitted to secretly taking the SAT and ACT for students, or correcting their answers, as part of a nationwide college admissions cheating scheme, which has ensnared celebrities, business executives and athletic coaches at sought-after schools such as Stanford and Yale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Riddell, who has been cooperating with authorities since February in the hopes of getting a lesser sentence, pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 36-year-old, wearing a dark suit and glasses, looked straight ahead and showed no emotion as assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen explained that prosecutors will seek a sentence at the low end of the guidelines, which call for 33 to 41 months in prison.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Harvard graduate oversaw college entrance exam preparation at IMG Academy, a Bradenton school founded by renowned tennis coach Nick Bollettieri that bills itself as the world's largest sports academy. Riddell has since been fired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authorities say the admissions consultant at the center of the scheme, Rick Singer, bribed test administrators to allow Riddell to pretend to proctor the exams for students so he could cheat on the tests. Singer typically paid Riddell $10,000 per test to rig the scores, prosecutors said.\n",
    "\n",
    "U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling has said Riddell knew all the answers because he was \"just a really smart guy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Riddell was among 50 people charged last month in the scam , which embroiled elite universities across the country and laid bare the lengths to which status-seeking parents will go to secure their children a coveted spot. Others arrested include actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin along with Loughlin's fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli.\n",
    "\n",

    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "The fbi called it Operation Varsity Blues. It was an investigation centred on William Singer, an enterprising college counsellor, who earned $25m from all manner of powerful people by fraudulently securing spots for their children at highly selective universities like Stanford and Yale. Among his clients charged with crimes were Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, two well-known actresses; Gordon Caplan, the co-chairman of an international law firm; and William McGlashan, a Silicon Valley private-equity executive who champions ethical investing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To grease the lucrative scheme, Mr Singer bribed proctors of admissions exams to fake scores and bribed athletics officials to accept wealthy children with concocted sports résumés, according to court documents unveiled by federal prosecutors on March 12th. The lurid details have provoked embarrassment for universities and Schadenfreude for the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an entirely legal way to corrupt the elite admissions system, which for some reason generates less outrage. Mr Singer grasped this dynamic: There is a front door “which means you get in on your own” and a “back door” secured by multimillion-dollar donations to universities, he explained in a recorded call to a client. What Mr Singer did—for 761 buyers, he claimed—is create a “side door” by bribing university officials and faking test scores that would achieve the same result at one-tenth of the cost. In effect, his scheme granted mere multimillionaires access to the billionaires’ entrance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting in through the side door was a sordid undertaking. According to prosecutors, Mr Singer bribed Rudy Meredith, then a women’s soccer coach at Yale, to accept a student who did not play competitive soccer. The relatives paid $1.2m for the slot. Ms Laughlin, one of the actresses, and her husband paid $500,000 to get their daughters, both Instagram influencers and minor celebrities in their own right, designated as crew-team recruits for the University of Southern California—despite the fact that neither one rowed. Mr Caplan, the international lawyer, allegedly faked a learning-disability diagnosis for his daughter and paid $75,000 for a boosted admissions score. The prosecutors, who flipped Mr Singer, enumerate several other jaw-dropping tales, backed up with wiretaps of the various notables admitting the finer details of the schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich children are already unfairly advantaged in the game of elite university admissions. They start out with stabler families, better schools and helpful networks. Elite American colleges then operate a large, entirely legal affirmative-action programme for the rich. Most highly selective American universities indulge in “legacy preferences”—positive discrimination for relatives of alumni—that disproportionately benefit the already rich. Such universities also have lax standards for recruited athletes, which helps rich children. Opportunities to row, fence or play golf do not abound in the ghetto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Funding a new building just as a mediocre child applies to college, in the hope of boosting their admission chances, remains perfectly legal so long as there is no established quid pro quo. The strategy seems common and successful. Emails recently revealed by a lawsuit show one Harvard dean “simply thrilled” about admissions decisions because one unnamed person had “already committed to building and building” and two others “committed major money for fellowships.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is that, for all the paeans sung to racial diversity, socioeconomic diversity in the hallowed ivy quadrangles remains woeful. A survey conducted by Yale’s student newspaper found that twice as many students come from families in the top 5% of the income distribution as from the entire bottom half.\n",

    "The scandal involves various illegal tactics to boost the probability that the children of wealthy parents will be admitted to elite universities.\n",
    "While some of the details are bizarre - including super-imposing student's heads onto athletes' bodies - many see parallels between this alleged scam and the way wealth affects education more generally.\n",

All big wins. [Name redacted] has already committed to building and building. [Name redacted] and [name redacted] committed major money for fellowships - before the decisions (from you) and are all likely to be prominent in the future. Most importantly, I think these will be superb additions to the class.\"\n",
    "In another email, an admissions officer at the university questioned how likely admitting an applicant would result in future donations.\n",
    "\"Going forward, I don't see a significant opportunity for further major gifts,\" the email says. \"[Redacted] had an art collection which conceivably could come our way. More probably it will go to [a] museum.\"\n",
    "Many on social media pointed out that the parents involved in the latest scandal would have legally been able to give large gifts to institutions to gain favourable treatment for their children.\n",

    "A network of affluent parents were this week accused of using audacious practices to secure their children places at elite US universities. What exactly is alleged?\n",
    "\"What we do is we help the wealthiest families in America get their kids into school.\"\n",
    "It was quite the mission statement.\n",
    "The words were spoken by the alleged kingpin of United States' biggest ever university admissions scam, William \"Rick\" Singer, according to prosecutors.\n",
    "He was making a pitch to a potential client, a wealthy New York lawyer, explaining the ways to get his child into a prestigious university.\n",
    "There were the normal channels - which rich people did not want to be \"messing around with\", he said. And then there was the back door and the side door.\n",
    "The back door necessitated contributing to \"institutional advancement\" - ie family connections or a multi-million-dollar donation, such as funding a new building, which is all legal.\n",
    "But the side door - the one that Singer had his foot jammed in and has drawn the attention of the authorities - was more accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "He could guarantee success, he said. All you had to do was make a \"financial commitment\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The revelations\n",
    "On Tuesday, reams of FBI documents were unsealed from \"Operation Varsity Blues\", an investigation named after a 1990s film about the pressures of sports scholarships.\n",
    "The case looked at a period between 2011 and 2018, when, according to the authorities, $25m in bribes were paid by people looking to sneak around the usual university admittance process.\n",
    "Fifty people - including 33 parents and various sports coaches - were indicted.\n",
    "\"I have never seen anything like this,\" Lenore Pearlstein, publisher of Insight Into Diversity magazine, which is dedicated to making higher education and business more inclusive in the US. \"The depth of it, the number of people involved, the amounts of money. It's mindboggling.\"\n",
    "It feels like a \"slap in the face\" for those genuinely trying to make change, she told the BBC.\n",
    "Among the most jaw-dropping revelations was the alleged involvement of Hollywood actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Ruh roh!\" as Huffman might say.\n",
    "The authorities alleged the star of TV series Desperate Housewives using this Scooby Do expression in email exchanges with Singer.\n",
    "According to the FBI, she was responding to news - in October 2017 - that her daughter's school wanted to use their own exam invigilator, rather than a compromised one who would be able to boost her scores.\n",
    "She allegedly emailed her concerns to Mr Singer. \"We will speak about it,\" he reportedly replied.\n",
    "William \"Rick\" Singer leaves the federal courthouse after facing charges in a nationwide college admissions cheating scheme in Boston, MassachusettsImage copyrightREUTERS\n",
    "\n",
    "The architect\n",
    "Rick Singer, a Californian life coach in his late 50s, presented himself as an expert in the university admissions process.\n",
    "He wrote books about it, including the self-published Getting In: Gaining Admission to Your College of Choice, which opened with an inspirational quote from Nelson Mandela.\n",
    "However, he kept his more illicit techniques within a closer circle.\n",
    "The FBI has traced his scam back to 2011. It is not known if this was a particular turning point in his three-decade career.\n",
    "In 2014, he founded a non-profit organisation called Key Worldwide, which claimed to help \"disadvantaged students around the world\". The website said it would \"open doors\" for young people escaping troubles such as gang violence.\n",
    "However, according to the authorities, the organisation functioned as a slush fund. It became a façade through which payments could be funnelled as \"charity donations\". Singer pocketed some of the cash and paid the rest in bribes to those who could help him get the results he guaranteed.\n",
    "Over time he had developed two possible paths to success. One would involve manipulating exam results. The other would involve securing special treatment - most typically via faked sporting prowess.\n",
    "According to the FBI, the two Hollywood actresses went down separate routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Huffman, Macy and the 'exam plot'\n",
    "The authorities claim that Felicity Huffman knew she needed to send her oldest daughter to a specific exam centre in West Hollywood to follow the plan. Hence the \"ruh-roh\" when it nearly went wrong.\n",
    "Singer had connections there.\n",
    "It is alleged that he would typically suggest his clients faked learning disabilities for their children and then, once they got a medical certificate, they would be granted extra time and could make a more believable case for switching to external exam centre.\n",
    "Huffman had allegedly already secured 100% extra time for her daughter's SAT (college entrance) exam. It is unclear how.\n",
    "Apparently, this was not enough.\n",
    "The next step involved bringing in someone else to take the test for her.\n",
    "Singer often used the services of a man called Mark Riddell. He was in his mid-30s, an ex-tennis professional, and the director of college entrance exam preparation at a boarding school in Florida.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the FBI, he would fly in, take the test for students in a hotel room, or sneak them the correct answers in the exam room, or inflate their scores when they finished. Sometimes he would be given a sample of the teen's handwriting so he could copy it.\n",
    "Riddell did not know the questions in advance, according to Andrew Lelling, US attorney for the District of Massachusetts. He was \"just a really smart guy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not yet known how Huffman first came into contact with Singer.\n",
    "In 2017, he visited the Los Angeles home she shares with her long-term partner, William H Macy, the star of Shameless and Fargo, the court documents say.\n",
    "The couple - who met in the early 80s and married in 1997 - are not usually caught in negative headlines. Macy's hobbies reportedly include woodturning and playing the ukulele, while Huffman has been running a wholesome parenting site, What The Flicka, based on her childhood nickname.\n",
    "They have been known to post loving messages to each other on social media.\n",
    "Early on Tuesday morning, FBI agents turned up at their door.\n",
    "Only Huffman was indicted. The crime she stands accused of relates to mail fraud, which is when communication methods are used to conduct a scheme that intentionally deprives another of property or honest services. Macy has not been charged.\n",
    "Neither has commented publicly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The couple made a $15,000 payment to the Key Worldwide Foundation for their older daughter's exam scheme, according to court documents.\n",
    "In an art-mirrors-life twist, it was the exact same amount that Huffman's character in Desperate Housewives had paid to a headmaster in an episode about corrupt schools admissions.\n",
    "In real life, her older daughter's exam score jumped 400 points - a huge leap - after Singer's involvement, it is claimed.\n",
    "If those claims are proven, Huffman and Macy appear to have secured a bargain. Many people paid hundreds of thousands for Singer's help. He usually paid $10,000 to the surrogate test-taker alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sports scam\n",
    "Academic manipulation was only one side of this story, and the alleged sports scam was even more outrageous.\n",
    "Singer was taking students with no prowess, and turning them into sporting stars on their applications, it is claimed.\n",
    "In some cases he would arrange for their heads to be Photoshopped on to more sporty bodies. In others, their basic stats would be manipulated - one basketball player had his height changed from 5ft 5in to 6ft 1in, presumably betting on a once-you're-in-you're-in outcome.\n",
    "Police found their first strong piece of evidence of this scheme during a wiretapped encounter in a hotel room in Boston, Massachusetts, according to the Boston Globe.\n",
    "The newspaper says that investigators had been working on an entirely different story - alleged fraud in the stock market - when they received an unexpected tip.\n",
    "A financial executive told them a sports coach from Yale University, Rudolph \"Rudy\" Meredith, asked for a bribe to help the businessman's daughter gain admittance to the Ivy League school.\n",
    "The executive agreed to wear a recording device and meet Meredith, who then offered to designate the young woman as a member of his soccer team.\n",
    "Meredith - as well as Singer and Riddell - have been working with the police, hoping to reduce their sentences.\n",
    "Sports bring in such huge amounts of money and prestige to US universities that they will often lower academic requirements to bring in new talent.\n",
    "\"Student athletes often have excellent leadership qualities and excel both in the classroom and on the field, recognising that makes sense for colleges looking for the best students,\" says Eric Yaverbaum, author of Life's Little College Admissions Insights.\n",
    "\"The hard work it requires to be a student athlete is what makes the fact that some of these parents took advantage of this route so disturbing. It's appalling that some parents and coaches betrayed those students by buying and selling those coveted positions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The daughters of Full House actress Lori Loughlin and fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli were not outstanding sportswomen.\n",
    "However, the couple allegedly spent $500,000 to get them into University of Southern California by presenting them as accomplished rowers. They have not commented since the charge were filed.\n",
    "\n",
    "After getting her place, their youngest daughter, Olivia Jade, made matters worse by bragging online, saying she would rather be concentrating on her Instagram career. She is an influencer and has 1.3 million followers.\n",
    "\"I don't know how much of school I'm gonna attend but I'm gonna go in and talk to my deans and everyone, and hope that I can try and balance it all,\" she said on her YouTube channel. \"But I do want the experience of like game days, partying… I don't really care about school, as you guys all know.\"\n",
    "She has since apologised for her comments, but the backlash has been huge.\n",
    "It is not clear how much any of the children knew about the alleged plots. According to the court documents, some were involved, at least to a certain degree, while others were in the dark.\n",
    "\"[The entire scandal] is a perfect example of the entitlement that comes with wealth and privilege,\" adds author Eric Yaverbaum.\n",
    "\"We knew the system was unfair (after all, wealthy parents can pay for multiple test retakes and expensive tutoring, and the wealthiest can pledge large donations to a school just as their children are applying), but we didn't know wealthy parents were taking it even further. In either case, it only reiterates the need for the admissions process to be re-evaluated.\"\n",
    "In recent days, the US media has uncovered that Loughlin's Full House character, Aunt Becky, was also involved in a school cheating story - perhaps indicating just how common the idea is, at least in theory.\n",
    "In real life, however, the story unfolding in the news has outdone the scriptwriters.\n",
    "Though the focus may have been on the two actresses so far, the rest of the cast of real-life characters is almost as intriguing.\n",
    "Other parents indicted include a self-help author, a casino operator and a Napa Valley vineyard owner.\n",
    "One of the many questions outstanding is - who will play whom in the inevitable TV adaptation?\n",

    "article['title'] = \"Admissions Scandal: When ‘Hard Work’ (Plus $6.5 Million) Helps Get You Into Stanford\"\n",
    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "Sitting in a plush chair and wearing a white blouse buttoned up to the neck, the young woman looks into the camera, smiles and offers advice about getting into a top American university.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Some people think, ‘Didn’t you get into Stanford because your family is rich?’” the woman, Yusi Zhao, says in a video posted on social media. It wasn’t like that, she says. The admissions officers “have no idea who you are.”\n",
    "\n",
    "She adds, “I tested into Stanford through my own hard work.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The video was recorded in the summer before Ms. Zhao began her freshman year, in 2017. It now stands in sharp contrast with recent news: that her parents paid $6.5 million to a college consultant at the center of an international college admissions scheme, according to a person with direct knowledge of the investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors say that the consultant, William Singer, tried to get Ms. Zhao recruited to the Stanford sailing team, providing a fake list of sailing accomplishments and making a $500,000 donation to the sailing program after she was admitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The payment to Mr. Singer was by far the largest known in the case, and the disclosure immediately added Ms. Zhao and her family, pharmaceutical billionaires from China, to a cast of powerful figures swept up in the scandal, including two Hollywood actresses and prominent names from the American legal and business worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new turns in the investigation, including reports that another family from China paid $1.2 million in connection with their daughter’s application to Yale, have illuminated the global reach of Mr. Singer’s operation and the wealthy Chinese families eager to get their children into prestigious American universities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer was far from alone in trying to profit from soaring demand in China for the elite American college experience. Many Chinese families turn to middlemen, whose fees can be tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, like some of their counterparts in the college consulting industry in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "In China, a dizzying array of companies offer advisory services that range from the legitimate to the openly dishonest — promising, as Mr. Singer did with some of his clients, guaranteed admission to certain schools in exchange for payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "A private club down the street from the Zhao family home outside Beijing was lined with advertisements for admissions consulting and SAT test-prep services. One company, called Capstone, offered “100 percent university clients accepted into 40 Top U.S. Universities.” Across the street were several businesses offering university consulting and tutoring; one had posted a list of the colleges and boarding schools where its clients had been admitted: Yale, Brown, Andover, Groton.\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses like these have boomed in China as the number of Chinese international students has steadily grown in the United States. In 2017, there were more than 363,000 Chinese students enrolled in American universities, more than a third of all international students, according to the Institute of International Education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jack Chen, a marketing executive for the Institute of Chinese Language and Culture, which offers college consulting and tutoring, said companies like his help students get reference letters, write essays and prepare for interviews. They also advise children on how to build up their résumés to include charity work and competitions that separate them from their peers, he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Chen said he knew of consulting companies that could find back doors into top universities in the United States, but he declined to disclose their names. He added that there used to be more of these services, but that American universities had cracked down after several cases of cheating by Chinese students on standardized exams and college applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it was perhaps the college consultants in the United States who had greater sway with Ms. Zhao’s parents, and the parents of the student in the Yale case, Sherry Guo. Both families pursued Mr. Singer’s services after meeting him through financial services companies in California, where he had formed relationships. Ms. Zhao’s family was introduced to him by an adviser at Morgan Stanley named Michael Wu, who the company said had been terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Federal prosecutors have so far charged 50 people in the admissions case, in which wealthy families are accused of cheating on college entrance exams and bribing college coaches to designate students as athletic recruits. Mr. Singer has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges, and has cooperated with the government in gathering evidence against his clients and others he is said to have worked with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors have not brought any charges against Ms. Zhao or her parents, nor against Ms. Guo or her parents. Both Ms. Zhao, who was a sophomore at Stanford, and Ms. Guo, who was a freshman at Yale, were expelled from their schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "A statement sent on behalf of Ms. Zhao’s mother by her lawyer, Vincent Law, said that Mrs. Zhao and her daughter were victims of Mr. Singer’s scheme, and that Mrs. Zhao had believed the $6.5 million was a legitimate donation to Stanford.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This generous act was not only done for the good of the school and its students, but also done out of the love and support of Yusi by a caring mother,” the statement said.\n",
    "\n",
    "It added that Mr. Singer had not offered guaranteed admission to any school and that her daughter had applied to and was accepted by a number of colleges “through ordinary channels.”\n",
    "\n",
    "A visit to the Zhao family home outside Beijing and a review of online records pointed to the world of luxury and privilege that Ms. Zhao had grown up in. But the family also publicly espoused an ethic of hard work and not falling back on inherited wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Ferrari, Tesla, Bentley and Land Rover sat parked outside the house, a California-style mansion surrounded by trees and a large hedge, in a gated development called Yosemite Villas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Zhao’s father, Zhao Tao, said in a 2015 profile of the family in a Chinese magazine that his children did not have their own fancy cars. “If they want to drive, they have to borrow one from me,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I really look down on those kids who don’t rely on their own abilities,” he added. “If I come across one, I give them a dressing down right away. I just can’t stand that type.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Zhao’s older sister, Zhao Yuchen, said in the same profile, “From early on we’ve been taught that the family’s money is the family’s and is none of our business. We can get the best education available, but if we want to live better off, we have to earn it ourselves. When we traveled, the adults went first class, for sure, but we kids had to ride economy in the back.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Zhao is the president and co-founder of Shandong Buchang Pharmaceuticals, a drug company that specializes in traditional Chinese medicines and health supplements. He started the company with his father in 1993, and it has become a family enterprise, employing Mr. Zhao’s brother, wife and elder daughter. A profile in Forbes lists Mr. Zhao’s net worth as $1.8 billion, describes him as a citizen of Singapore, and says he received an M.B.A. from Fordham University.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement released by the company on Friday, Mr. Zhao said: “The arrangements for my daughter’s studies in the United States are a matter for me and my family, and the source of the funds has nothing to do with Buchang Pharmaceuticals, and will not have any impact on the financial situation of Buchang Pharmaceuticals.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Zhao’s father, Zhao Buchang, was himself at one point accused of bribery: He was found by prosecutors to have paid $10,000 in 2002 to a senior official in China’s food and drug administration who was sentenced to death for corruption in 2007.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Zhao is also on the board of a group, called Wisdom Valley in English, which says it provides support and advice for Chinese family businesses. Through that group, Mr. Zhao met and posed for a photograph with President Trump and Melania Trump in 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "His daughter went to elementary school in Beijing before going to England for the latter part of middle school and for high school, where she attended a prestigious boarding school.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a freshman at Stanford, Ms. Zhao was part of a selective academic-and-residential program called Structured Liberal Education, a yearlong intensive course in Western literature and culture and the history of ideas, according to Rob Reich, a professor of political science who has given lectures in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 90 freshmen in Structured Liberal Education live together and attend lectures by humanities scholars from across the university. According to its website, the program “encourages students to live a life of ideas in an atmosphere that emphasizes critical thinking and interpretation.”\n",
    "\n",
    "She also belonged to an organization called the Stanford Speakers Bureau, which brings high-profile speakers like Jennifer Lopez and Ban Ki Moon to campus.\n",
    "\n",
    "“She was very friendly — and very dedicated,” Alexa Ramachandran, 18, a freshman member, said of Ms. Zhao. “She would go around to the dorms, asking if there was anything more she could do for the club.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video Ms. Zhao made about getting into Stanford, which is over 90 minutes long, Ms. Zhao said that she rode horses in her spare time, and that she planned to take sociology classes at Stanford and return to China after graduating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Zhao repeatedly exhorted her viewers to work hard and believe in themselves, using her own journey as a lesson. She said that she had been a mediocre student in elementary school and that her first ACT score had been unimpressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "“A lot of people told me, ‘You still want to get into Stanford, but, look, the entry rate for it is just 4 percent — just forget it,’” she said. After a year of strenuous study, she said, she took the test again and got a score of 33 out of 36.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Based on my experience of study, I want to tell you that really anyone can do it,” she went on. “I’m not the kind who was born with a very high I.Q. or who can score 33 or 36 in an exam just like that. But I made my way up step by step, through my hard work.”\n",
    "\n",
    "She decided to aim for American universities, she said, because they evaluated students not just based on test scores, but also on their extracurricular activities and personal statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It demands not only that you’re a good student, but also that you have personality,” she said. “You need to have a special skill.”\n",
