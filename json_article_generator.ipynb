    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "An executive at the investment giant TPG who was charged in a huge college admissions scandal introduced colleagues on the firm’s deal team to the scheme’s ringleader, but nothing came of the business discussions, TPG said on Thursday.\n",
    "\n",
    "TPG also said it planned to strip the executive, William E. McGlashan Jr., of most of the profits he was due from funds he oversaw.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disclosures, in a memorandum to employees, followed an internal investigation into Mr. McGlashan, whom TPG said it had fired last month after he was implicated in the admissions scheme. (Mr. McGlashan has insisted that he resigned before he was fired.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Federal prosecutors have accused Mr. McGlashan, one of TPG’s biggest stars and a powerful Silicon Valley investor, with paying $50,000 to a charity run by the businessman William Singer in exchange for getting his son extra time to complete a college-entrance exam. He is also accused of agreeing to pay $250,000 to ensure his son’s admission to the University of Southern California as a football recruit, although prosecutors have said he did not follow through with that scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lawyers for Mr. McGlashan have indicated that he plans to fight the charges of money laundering and fraud against him. A representative for Mr. McGlashan did not have an immediate comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the memo, TPG, which has more than $103 billion under management, said Mr. McGlashan had met with Mr. Singer in early 2017, and then introduced him to colleagues to discuss potential business ideas. The introduction was made before the admissions fraud that federal prosecutors say Mr. McGlashan participated in, according to the firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TPG deal team quickly decided against working with Mr. Singer, the memo said. Two other TPG employees did hire Mr. Singer, but for what the firm described as legitimate college-counseling services.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We are confident that the process and deal team worked as they should, free from any undue influence by Mr. McGlashan or knowledge of unethical or criminal behavior in Mr. Singer’s businesses,” a TPG spokesman said in a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "TPG also said in the memo that it had determined the financial terms of Mr. McGlashan’s severance based on the documents governing its funds. He will lose all profits he would be owed from the firm’s Growth and Rise funds — potentially millions of dollars — but will retain any stake in the firm itself that had already vested. The Growth fund has invested in technology darlings like Uber.\n",

    "article['title'] = \"A Mystery Solved in the College Admissions Scandal: The Family Who Paid $1.2 Million\"\n",
    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "One of the mysteries of the sweeping college admissions fraud case has been over the families that prosecutors say paid the biggest sums to a college consultant at the center of the schemes but that have not been charged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 33 parents charged in the scandal are mostly accused of paying the consultant, William Singer, either tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to facilitate cheating on admissions tests or to bribe coaches or other officials so that their children could be admitted to schools as recruited athletes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the prosecutors leading the largest-ever college admissions prosecution have also alluded to other families, not named and not charged, who paid far more. One family paid Mr. Singer $6.5 million to get their child into college through the recruitment scheme, the prosecutors have said. Another was described in court documents as having paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million in connection with their daughter’s application to Yale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors said that the daughter, whom they called Yale Applicant 1 in court documents, was admitted to Yale as a recruit for the women’s soccer team, despite not being a competitive soccer player. According to documents charging Rudolph Meredith, the former women’s soccer coach at Yale, Mr. Singer had paid Mr. Meredith a bribe to designate the young woman as a recruit for the team. Mr. Singer has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges, and Mr. Meredith has pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Friday, Yale Applicant 1 was finally identified: She is Sherry Guo, a young woman from China who moved to Southern California for high school, and who was a freshman at Yale until last month, according to her lawyer, James Spertus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Guo’s identity was first reported on Friday by The Wall Street Journal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A spokeswoman for the United States attorney’s office in Boston, Christina Sterling, declined to comment on Ms. Guo’s case. Asked why Ms. Guo and her parents — as well as the still unidentified family that was said to have paid Mr. Singer $6.5 million — have not been charged in the case, she said, “I cannot comment other than to say it is an ongoing investigation.”\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the charges against Mr. Meredith, Ms. Guo and her family were introduced to Mr. Singer in 2017 by a financial adviser based in Los Angeles. An employee of the financial adviser sent Mr. Singer an email “stating that Yale Applicant 1’s father wished to make a ‘donation’ to ‘one of those top schools for his daughter’s ‘application,’” the charging documents said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer promptly sent Ms. Guo’s résumé and personal statement to Mr. Meredith, the soccer coach, according to the charging documents. Her personal statement contained links to her art portfolio; Mr. Singer told Mr. Meredith he would “revise” the materials to “soccer.” A few days later, he sent Mr. Meredith an athletic profile that falsely described Ms. Guo as the co-captain of a prominent club soccer team in Southern California. Mr. Meredith then designated her as a recruit for the soccer team.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the charging documents, Mr. Singer mailed Mr. Meredith a check for $400,000 in 2018, and later that year, Ms. Guo’s relatives paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million in several installments, $900,000 of which was sent to a nonprofit foundation Mr. Singer had set up, and which prosecutors argue was used to hide much of Mr. Singer’s and his clients’ illicit activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Spertus said that Ms. Guo and her parents did not know that the payment was going toward a bribe. Her parents did not speak English and were not in direct contact with Mr. Singer, he said, while Ms. Guo herself was naïve about how the college admissions process worked in the United States. (Mr. Spertus would not identify Ms. Guo’s parents.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Guo wanted to go to Columbia University or Oxford, Mr. Spertus said, but Mr. Singer told her to apply to Yale, and that she would be guaranteed to get in. While that might have seemed strange to a student who grew up in the United States, he said, Ms. Guo did not expect to have much choice about where to go to college.\n",
    "\n",
    "“She wasn’t working with Singer to find the best school for her,” he said. “She is now devastated because she is no longer in college, period.” Yale has said that it rescinded the admission of one student in connection with the case, but has not identified the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "He said that Ms. Guo was not copied on either of the emails that Mr. Singer sent to Mr. Meredith suggesting that her college credentials be falsified to say she played soccer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Spertus said the large size of the payment suggested that Mr. Singer was exploiting Ms. Guo’s family and their lack of knowledge about the college process.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The amount alone shows that he was preying on the Chinese community,” he said. “The donation was made to help underprivileged youth. They were not aware that the money went to Meredith. They did not know that he was going to use that money for a bribe. There is no evidence of that whatsoever.”\n",

    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "After 50 people, including parents and coaches, were charged last month with crimes, the nation’s largest-ever college admissions prosecution appeared to be ensnaring another group — students.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a lawyer involved in the case, at least some children of the parents who were charged in the scandal have received so-called target letters, which notify people that they could be targets of a criminal probe. The lawyer declined to be quoted by name, citing sensitivities about the ongoing case. A spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor’s office in Boston, which is handling the case, declined to comment on the development, which was previously reported in Law360, a legal news service, and The Wall Street Journal.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was uncertain on Monday how many students received such target letters or whether they would, in fact, lead to additional charges. Several defense lawyers in the case said the children of their clients — parents charged with trying to get their children admitted to college with falsified athletic credentials or altered test scores — had not received such letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Federal prosecutors have said that some of the young people involved in the case were oblivious to what their parents were doing, while others were not. “At times, the students were in on it,” a federal prosecutor, Eric S. Rosen, said in court last week during one in a long schedule of hearings in the sprawling case.\n",
    "\n",
    "More than a dozen parents, including the actress Lori Loughlin, have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them, court documents showed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Loughlin’s not guilty plea on Monday came a week after 13 other parents, including the actress Felicity Huffman, indicated that they would plead guilty. The decisions by Ms. Loughlin and Ms. Huffman, the most widely known parents involved in the case, were only the latest way in which their legal paths have diverged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Loughlin waived her right to appear in court for an arraignment after being indicted last week on a count of conspiracy to commit fraud and another of money laundering conspiracy. Her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, also entered a not guilty plea to the same charges, documents showed.\n",

    "article['title'] = \"His Father Paid $400,000 to Get Him Into Georgetown. Now He’s Suing the School.\"\n",
    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "Georgetown University said Wednesday that it planned to dismiss two students connected to the college admissions scandal. Just hours earlier, one of those students, Adam Semprevivo, whose father has pleaded guilty in the case, sued Georgetown for threatening to expel him, saying that the university had denied him due process and that it should have been aware of misrepresentations on his application long before the Justice Department announced charges in the nation’s largest college admissions prosecution earlier this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Georgetown did not identify either student, but Mr. Semprevivo’s lawyer, David Kenner, said he had received an email from Georgetown informing him that his admission had been rescinded and that he would be dismissed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Semprevivo, 21, who is from Los Angeles, just finished his junior year at the college in Washington, D.C. His father, Stephen Semprevivo, pleaded guilty last week to paying a college consultant $400,000 to secure his son’s admission to Georgetown as a recruit to the tennis team, even though the son did not play tennis competitively. According to the lawsuit, Adam has a 3.18 grade point average in college so far. He has not been charged in the case, nor have any other students, though several have received target letters from prosecutors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Kenner said that dismissal was too harsh a punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It’s a life sentence,” he said. “He’s lost three years of his life, studying, getting good grades, doing everything that was expected of him.” He added it could be difficult for Mr. Semprevivo to gain admission to another college and that the dismissal could also affect his job prospects. “Potentially this will follow him for the rest of his life.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The lawsuit — which appears to be the first case of a student suing over discipline imposed as a result of the scandal — underscores the complicated position that universities find themselves in as they try to figure out what action, if any, to take against students connected to the case. Some students appear to have been oblivious to their parents’ illicit efforts to get them into elite colleges, while others were aware, according to documents in the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some answers to important questions about the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors say that Georgetown’s former tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, took $2.7 million in bribes from the college counselor at the center of the case, William Singer, between 2012 and 2018. In exchange for the bribes, according to prosecutors, Mr. Ernst designated at least 12 of the children of Mr. Singer’s clients as recruits to the tennis team, ensuring their admission to Georgetown, one of eight colleges — including Yale, Stanford, and the University of Southern California — where prosecutors say the scheme played out. Mr. Ernst has been charged with conspiracy to commit racketeering and has pleaded not guilty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The charging documents specifically mention five parents or sets of parents whose children prosecutors say were designated by Mr. Ernst as recruits to the Georgetown tennis team. In four of those cases, prosecutors say the students’ applications included fabrications about their supposed tennis accomplishments. One student appears to have actually played tennis in high school, but not at Georgetown. Two of the students have already graduated.\n",
    "\n",
    "More than a year before federal authorities announced charges in the wide-reaching scandal, Georgetown knew of problems with Mr. Ernst’s recruiting practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017, the admissions office discovered what a spokeswoman called “irregularities in the athletic and other credentials” of two students being recruited by Mr. Ernst to play tennis. The university placed Mr. Ernst on leave and began an internal investigation, which found that he had violated university rules concerning admissions. The university asked him to resign in 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Ernst went on to get a job as the head coach of women’s tennis at the University of Rhode Island. Georgetown has said that it knew nothing about the bribes described by prosecutors and did not find any criminal activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Georgetown gave few details about its investigation of the students. In a statement, a spokeswoman said that, after the charges were brought in the case earlier this year, the university began a review focused on whether any students knowingly provided false information to the university when they applied for admission.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Each student case was addressed individually and each student was given multiple opportunities to respond and provide information to the University,” the spokeswoman, Meghan Dubyak, said in an email.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Semprevivo’s lawsuit sheds a little more light. It says that Mr. Semprevivo first learned he was being investigated in April, through an email from a university official. It says that he was later sent a letter with a list of 29 questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two months after charges in the admissions scandal were first announced, some colleges have taken steps to remove students while others appear to be still sorting through what to do. Yale and Stanford have each rescinded the admission of one student. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the University of Southern California, roughly two dozen students were being investigated through the student judicial affairs committee. The total number of current students being investigated or who have been investigated at schools around the country is most likely 30 or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was not immediately clear why some schools have moved quickly while others have taken more time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not clear what Adam Semprevivo knew about the admissions scheme, though he did send an email to Mr. Ernst — drafted by Mr. Singer — with false statements about his tennis experience, and he received an email from Mr. Singer with an essay intended for his Georgetown application that also contained false statements, according to both the charging documents and the lawsuit. His application to Georgetown also listed other fabricated tennis credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lawsuit says that Mr. Singer told Mr. Semprevivo that Mr. Ernst was a friend and would provide a recommendation for him during the admissions process. It also says that Mr. Singer submitted Mr. Semprevivo’s application and typed his name in the signature block. Students are required to sign their applications to affirm that the information in their application is accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Kenner, the lawyer, said that Mr. Singer had worked with Mr. Semprevivo for over a year — coming to his house every two or three weeks to tutor and advise him — and gained his trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "“He took over the process,” he said of Mr. Singer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another current student whose parents have been charged in the case also seems to have been at least somewhat aware, according to the charging documents. Prosecutors have said that Elizabeth and Manuel Henriquez, a couple from Atherton, Calif., paid Mr. Singer $400,000 to bribe Mr. Ernst to designate their elder daughter, Isabelle, as a recruit to the tennis team. Additionally, according to prosecutors, the Henriquezes paid Mr. Singer at least $50,000 to arrange for cheating on the SAT, ACT and SAT subject tests for Isabelle and her younger sister. The Henriquezes have pleaded not guilty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Adam Semprevivo, Isabelle Henriquez also sent an email to Mr. Ernst that was drafted by Mr. Singer, with fabrications about her tennis experience, according to documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors have said that Ms. Henriquez actively participated in the test cheating scheme. According to the charging documents, Mr. Singer arranged for an SAT expert to proctor her SAT in exchange for a bribe. The proctor, Mark Riddell, who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering and is cooperating with the investigation, told investigators that he had sat next to Ms. Henriquez during the exam and provided her answers, according to the criminal complaint. Afterward, he said, he “gloated” with Ms. Henriquez and her mother “about the fact that they had cheated and gotten away with it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Henriquez and representatives for her parents did not respond to messages asking if her admission had been rescinded.\n",
    "\n",
    "A handful of children whose parents are accused of bribery have received their degrees. It is unclear how, if at all, schools could discipline those students. While some colleges have revoked degrees in the past for plagiarism, for example, such a move would most likely open up universities to lawsuits, particularly as the students have earned the credits for courses they successfully completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Dubyak, the Georgetown spokeswoman, said the university’s review process had focused first on current students, but would still look at students who had graduated.\n",

    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "Felicity Huffman, the Hollywood actress, on Monday laid out a list of failings: Yes, she had paid a college counselor $15,000 to arrange for cheating on her daughter’s SAT test. And yes, it had backfired miserably, turning what Ms. Huffman said had been an effort to help her daughter into a betrayal of her.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am ashamed,” Ms. Huffman said, announcing that she will plead guilty to a federal crime, part of a sweeping investigation of college admissions fraud unveiled last month by prosecutors in Boston.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the statement issued by Ms. Huffman, she said she wanted to apologize to her family, friends and colleagues, and especially, she said, “to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Huffman was one of 50 people charged in a sweeping investigation of college admissions fraud unveiled last month by federal prosecutors in Boston. On Monday, prosecutors said that 14 people — 13 parents and one coach — would plead guilty in the case. Dates for the formal pleas in court had yet to be set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Huffman said that her daughter had been unaware of the cheating — prosecutors say a proctor corrected her test answers after she had left. And Ms. Huffman acknowledged that, in an attempt to assist her daughter, she had ultimately hurt and betrayed her.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life,” she said. “My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The case prosecutors have laid out centers on a college consultant, William Singer, whom Ms. Huffman and the other parents hired to guide them through the application process. According to prosecutors, Mr. Singer specialized in boosting students’ chances through fraud: He bribed test administrators to allow cheating on college entrance exams and bribed college coaches to designate his clients’ children as recruits to teams for which they were not actually qualified. Mr. Singer cooperated with prosecutors and has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "A total of 33 parents were charged in the case. Some have made clear they will fight the charges, while others may still be debating what to do. Ms. Huffman is the highest-profile parent to admit wrongdoing in the case so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, were also charged and were not among those who prosecutors said on Monday would plead guilty. The government has said that the couple conspired with Mr. Singer to pay $500,000 in bribes to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as recruits to the women’s crew team, even though neither actually rowed crew. Ms. Loughlin has lost some professional opportunities as a result of the charges — most notably, the Hallmark Channel said that it would stop development of shows that feature her.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not clear what impact Ms. Huffman’s acknowledgment of guilt will have on her career. She has roles in several coming movies and television series, including playing the prosecutor Linda Fairstein in the mini-series “When They See Us” about the so-called Central Park Five, five black and Hispanic teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of beating and raping a female jogger in Central Park in 1989.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors said that Ms. Huffman and most of the other parents would plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, but it is unclear how much time, if any, Ms. Huffman and the other parents will receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their sentences may be affected in part by how much money each is alleged to have paid to Mr. Singer and others as part of the scheme. Ms. Huffman’s payment of $15,000 was among the smallest, according to court documents. Ms. Huffman’s and the 12 other parents’ sentences are also likely to be lighter as a result of their pleading guilty and not making the government go to trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the parents, prosecutors said on Monday that one of several coaches charged in the case, Michael Center, the former head coach of men’s tennis at the University of Texas at Austin, would also plead guilty to the same crime. Prosecutors said that Mr. Singer paid Mr. Center $60,000 in cash and directed $40,000 to the University of Texas tennis program in exchange for Mr. Center designating the son of one of Mr. Singer’s clients as a recruit for the tennis team, even though he was not a competitive tennis player and did not ultimately play on the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two parents, Bruce and Davina Isackson of Hillsborough, Calif., have also agreed to cooperate, prosecutors said. The Isacksons were accused of paying Mr. Singer $600,000 to bribe athletics officials in order to secure their two daughters’ admission to U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. as athletic recruits, and to cheat on their younger daughter’s ACT.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the criminal complaint against Ms. Huffman, her husband, William H. Macy, was also involved in the $15,000 payment to Mr. Singer. For reasons that are unclear, Mr. Macy was not charged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of students who have been punished as a result of the investigation is also growing. Last week, Stanford announced that it had expelled a student who had falsely claimed in her application to be a competitive sailor and had vacated the credits that she had already accumulated. The student’s name has not been made public. The former Stanford sailing coach, John Vandemoer, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering and has acknowledged accepting donations to his sailing program from Mr. Singer in exchange for agreeing to use recruiting slots for Mr. Singer’s clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The student whom Stanford expelled, the daughter of a client of Mr. Singer’s, was not actually recruited as a sailor, but after she was admitted, Mr. Singer directed $500,000 to Stanford’s sailing program.\n",

Wealthy, well-known parents are accused of paying to open “side doors” for their children to enter schools including Yale, Stanford and Georgetown.\n",

Then there are the taxpayers, who contribute to funding higher education and expect their dollars to be used fairly.\n",

This practice, at a public university no less, gave places to students known to be underqualified as admissions officers complained in vain.\n",

She pitched products as an Instagram influencer and pouted about college on social media. “It’s so hard to try in school when you don’t care about anything you’re learning,” she posted.\n",
    "\n",
    "What a stick in the weary eye of any diligent student who sweated over an admissions essay and deserved an honest shot at admittance at a time when USC was crowing about its declining acceptance rate. Just 13 percent of students who applied won a spot in 2018 as “a landslide of outstanding applications (raised) the bar for admits,” it said on its website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitive college admissions is a zero-sum game. There are only so many spots available, so for each cheater, a worthy student is displaced. And for every revelation of clout or cheating, untold numbers of young people get the message that merit doesn’t matter, only money. Why strive in a rigged system?\n",
    "\n",
    "Students from disadvantaged backgrounds already know they’re competing against peers who have every benefit — from healthy food, homework help and enriching vacations to freedom from worries about side jobs and student loan debt. Those who believe all young people deserve an opportunity to succeed in life should support rooting out the corruption and favoritism that hurts families who attempt to compete on the merits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any parent convicted in this scheme has done harm to the public, other students and their own children, too — by corrupting the notion of achievement. Here’s a lesson for the ages, and we offer it for free: The bought trophy never satisfies.\n",

    "Aunt Becky … why did you do it? You did a disservice to your children. A disservice that will extend beyond the legal trouble you’re in. The biggest misstep? That your kids think you don’t have faith in their abilities to make their own way without your ongoing interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lori Loughlin has forged an acting career as a wholesome, girl-next-door mainstay — one anchored on “Full House” as Rebecca Donaldson. But Loughlin has sabotaged that goodness forever. True, it was done while running to the aid of her children. But at the cost of $500,000?\n",
    "\n",
    "Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannuli, were among the celebrities and CEOs charged with bribing and cheating to get their kids into elite schools, including Yale, Georgetown and the University of Southern California. Loughlin was released on $1 million bond after being taken into FBI custody in Los Angeles on March 13. So many questions surround the scandal, including whether the children knew about what occurred before the FBI got involved. If you’re a person with college loan debt, the frustration is real. Investigations like this only feed the conspiracy theorist in all of us.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the lingering issue in this scandal is the negative message that parents — even with the best intentions — send their offspring. The most injured parties in this are the children. For parents not to believe in their child’s skills, prowess, creativity and persistence to the point that they need to pay to ensure success is guaranteed? Whoa. That would destroy some children.\n",
    "\n",
    "“A lot of parents seem to lack confidence in their kids — that their kids can step up and manage on their own and work hard and achieve and succeed on their own. And I think that has a real impact on kids — to feel on some level their parents don’t necessarily have faith in them,” says Dr. Paul Donahue, a clinical psychologist based in Scarsdale, N.Y. “I think there are some parents that really worry that their job is to help their kids avoid frustration or disappointment or not have any painful experiences, and that’s not really our job as parents. Our job is to create situations where our kids can work hard and they can sustain themselves, even when they are facing adversity. It’s back to that idea of faith and confidence that the kids are going to be OK, and one school or college admission is not going to define who they are.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Donahue, author of the book “Parenting Without Fear,” says there’s been a shift from values to achievements (kids’ grades, test scores, athleticism and popularity), resulting in young people feeling that their self-worth is based on said achievements, as opposed to the kind of person they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the news came to light, it was as if Loughlin, Felicity Huffman and others had written in permanent marker for the world to see, “As parents, we don’t believe in our children.” Parents know their children and their capabilities whether they articulate them or not. But to put out that doubt in such a public way is unconscionable. Are we, as a society, so afraid of failure that risking jail time is a tenable argument? If so, we need to have a class called Enabler 101 taught early and frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re all trying to figure out life, and we do that by failure, success, reaching, missing, getting scarred and putting a Band-Aid on to do it again with more experience. Limitations are learned, morals are set, mettle is determined in each instance. Lost potential is one thing when it’s children making the missteps. But when parents use cold, hard cash to confirm secretly held fears that their kids are not good enough, what is there left to say?\n",
    "\n",
    "Donahue thinks this incident is an opportunity for people to pause and reflect on how parents stepping in to make life easier for their children is affecting kids.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What we see in some of the kids who get into elite schools is that they’re great at getting good grades, taking tests and doing what they’re supposed to do, but in terms of managing their life, dealing with disappointment, dealing with frustration, handling challenges, kids aren’t necessarily great at that,” Donahue says. “And ultimately, what’s going to define successful people and people who do well in different phases of their life is going to be how resilient you are.”\n",

    "\n",
    "Mark Riddell admitted to secretly taking the SAT and ACT for students, or correcting their answers, as part of a nationwide college admissions cheating scheme, which has ensnared celebrities, business executives and athletic coaches at sought-after schools such as Stanford and Yale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Riddell, who has been cooperating with authorities since February in the hopes of getting a lesser sentence, pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 36-year-old, wearing a dark suit and glasses, looked straight ahead and showed no emotion as assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen explained that prosecutors will seek a sentence at the low end of the guidelines, which call for 33 to 41 months in prison.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Harvard graduate oversaw college entrance exam preparation at IMG Academy, a Bradenton school founded by renowned tennis coach Nick Bollettieri that bills itself as the world's largest sports academy. Riddell has since been fired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authorities say the admissions consultant at the center of the scheme, Rick Singer, bribed test administrators to allow Riddell to pretend to proctor the exams for students so he could cheat on the tests. Singer typically paid Riddell $10,000 per test to rig the scores, prosecutors said.\n",
    "\n",
    "U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling has said Riddell knew all the answers because he was \"just a really smart guy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Riddell was among 50 people charged last month in the scam , which embroiled elite universities across the country and laid bare the lengths to which status-seeking parents will go to secure their children a coveted spot. Others arrested include actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin along with Loughlin's fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli.\n",
    "\n",

    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "The fbi called it Operation Varsity Blues. It was an investigation centred on William Singer, an enterprising college counsellor, who earned $25m from all manner of powerful people by fraudulently securing spots for their children at highly selective universities like Stanford and Yale. Among his clients charged with crimes were Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, two well-known actresses; Gordon Caplan, the co-chairman of an international law firm; and William McGlashan, a Silicon Valley private-equity executive who champions ethical investing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To grease the lucrative scheme, Mr Singer bribed proctors of admissions exams to fake scores and bribed athletics officials to accept wealthy children with concocted sports résumés, according to court documents unveiled by federal prosecutors on March 12th. The lurid details have provoked embarrassment for universities and Schadenfreude for the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an entirely legal way to corrupt the elite admissions system, which for some reason generates less outrage. Mr Singer grasped this dynamic: There is a front door “which means you get in on your own” and a “back door” secured by multimillion-dollar donations to universities, he explained in a recorded call to a client. What Mr Singer did—for 761 buyers, he claimed—is create a “side door” by bribing university officials and faking test scores that would achieve the same result at one-tenth of the cost. In effect, his scheme granted mere multimillionaires access to the billionaires’ entrance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting in through the side door was a sordid undertaking. According to prosecutors, Mr Singer bribed Rudy Meredith, then a women’s soccer coach at Yale, to accept a student who did not play competitive soccer. The relatives paid $1.2m for the slot. Ms Laughlin, one of the actresses, and her husband paid $500,000 to get their daughters, both Instagram influencers and minor celebrities in their own right, designated as crew-team recruits for the University of Southern California—despite the fact that neither one rowed. Mr Caplan, the international lawyer, allegedly faked a learning-disability diagnosis for his daughter and paid $75,000 for a boosted admissions score. The prosecutors, who flipped Mr Singer, enumerate several other jaw-dropping tales, backed up with wiretaps of the various notables admitting the finer details of the schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich children are already unfairly advantaged in the game of elite university admissions. They start out with stabler families, better schools and helpful networks. Elite American colleges then operate a large, entirely legal affirmative-action programme for the rich. Most highly selective American universities indulge in “legacy preferences”—positive discrimination for relatives of alumni—that disproportionately benefit the already rich. Such universities also have lax standards for recruited athletes, which helps rich children. Opportunities to row, fence or play golf do not abound in the ghetto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Funding a new building just as a mediocre child applies to college, in the hope of boosting their admission chances, remains perfectly legal so long as there is no established quid pro quo. The strategy seems common and successful. Emails recently revealed by a lawsuit show one Harvard dean “simply thrilled” about admissions decisions because one unnamed person had “already committed to building and building” and two others “committed major money for fellowships.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is that, for all the paeans sung to racial diversity, socioeconomic diversity in the hallowed ivy quadrangles remains woeful. A survey conducted by Yale’s student newspaper found that twice as many students come from families in the top 5% of the income distribution as from the entire bottom half.\n",

    "The scandal involves various illegal tactics to boost the probability that the children of wealthy parents will be admitted to elite universities.\n",
    "While some of the details are bizarre - including super-imposing student's heads onto athletes' bodies - many see parallels between this alleged scam and the way wealth affects education more generally.\n",

All big wins. [Name redacted] has already committed to building and building. [Name redacted] and [name redacted] committed major money for fellowships - before the decisions (from you) and are all likely to be prominent in the future. Most importantly, I think these will be superb additions to the class.\"\n",
    "In another email, an admissions officer at the university questioned how likely admitting an applicant would result in future donations.\n",
    "\"Going forward, I don't see a significant opportunity for further major gifts,\" the email says. \"[Redacted] had an art collection which conceivably could come our way. More probably it will go to [a] museum.\"\n",
    "Many on social media pointed out that the parents involved in the latest scandal would have legally been able to give large gifts to institutions to gain favourable treatment for their children.\n",

    "A network of affluent parents were this week accused of using audacious practices to secure their children places at elite US universities. What exactly is alleged?\n",
    "\"What we do is we help the wealthiest families in America get their kids into school.\"\n",
    "It was quite the mission statement.\n",
    "The words were spoken by the alleged kingpin of United States' biggest ever university admissions scam, William \"Rick\" Singer, according to prosecutors.\n",
    "He was making a pitch to a potential client, a wealthy New York lawyer, explaining the ways to get his child into a prestigious university.\n",
    "There were the normal channels - which rich people did not want to be \"messing around with\", he said. And then there was the back door and the side door.\n",
    "The back door necessitated contributing to \"institutional advancement\" - ie family connections or a multi-million-dollar donation, such as funding a new building, which is all legal.\n",
    "But the side door - the one that Singer had his foot jammed in and has drawn the attention of the authorities - was more accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "He could guarantee success, he said. All you had to do was make a \"financial commitment\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The revelations\n",
    "On Tuesday, reams of FBI documents were unsealed from \"Operation Varsity Blues\", an investigation named after a 1990s film about the pressures of sports scholarships.\n",
    "The case looked at a period between 2011 and 2018, when, according to the authorities, $25m in bribes were paid by people looking to sneak around the usual university admittance process.\n",
    "Fifty people - including 33 parents and various sports coaches - were indicted.\n",
    "\"I have never seen anything like this,\" Lenore Pearlstein, publisher of Insight Into Diversity magazine, which is dedicated to making higher education and business more inclusive in the US. \"The depth of it, the number of people involved, the amounts of money. It's mindboggling.\"\n",
    "It feels like a \"slap in the face\" for those genuinely trying to make change, she told the BBC.\n",
    "Among the most jaw-dropping revelations was the alleged involvement of Hollywood actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Ruh roh!\" as Huffman might say.\n",
    "The authorities alleged the star of TV series Desperate Housewives using this Scooby Do expression in email exchanges with Singer.\n",
    "According to the FBI, she was responding to news - in October 2017 - that her daughter's school wanted to use their own exam invigilator, rather than a compromised one who would be able to boost her scores.\n",
    "She allegedly emailed her concerns to Mr Singer. \"We will speak about it,\" he reportedly replied.\n",
    "William \"Rick\" Singer leaves the federal courthouse after facing charges in a nationwide college admissions cheating scheme in Boston, MassachusettsImage copyrightREUTERS\n",
    "\n",
    "The architect\n",
    "Rick Singer, a Californian life coach in his late 50s, presented himself as an expert in the university admissions process.\n",
    "He wrote books about it, including the self-published Getting In: Gaining Admission to Your College of Choice, which opened with an inspirational quote from Nelson Mandela.\n",
    "However, he kept his more illicit techniques within a closer circle.\n",
    "The FBI has traced his scam back to 2011. It is not known if this was a particular turning point in his three-decade career.\n",
    "In 2014, he founded a non-profit organisation called Key Worldwide, which claimed to help \"disadvantaged students around the world\". The website said it would \"open doors\" for young people escaping troubles such as gang violence.\n",
    "However, according to the authorities, the organisation functioned as a slush fund. It became a façade through which payments could be funnelled as \"charity donations\". Singer pocketed some of the cash and paid the rest in bribes to those who could help him get the results he guaranteed.\n",
    "Over time he had developed two possible paths to success. One would involve manipulating exam results. The other would involve securing special treatment - most typically via faked sporting prowess.\n",
    "According to the FBI, the two Hollywood actresses went down separate routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Huffman, Macy and the 'exam plot'\n",
    "The authorities claim that Felicity Huffman knew she needed to send her oldest daughter to a specific exam centre in West Hollywood to follow the plan. Hence the \"ruh-roh\" when it nearly went wrong.\n",
    "Singer had connections there.\n",
    "It is alleged that he would typically suggest his clients faked learning disabilities for their children and then, once they got a medical certificate, they would be granted extra time and could make a more believable case for switching to external exam centre.\n",
    "Huffman had allegedly already secured 100% extra time for her daughter's SAT (college entrance) exam. It is unclear how.\n",
    "Apparently, this was not enough.\n",
    "The next step involved bringing in someone else to take the test for her.\n",
    "Singer often used the services of a man called Mark Riddell. He was in his mid-30s, an ex-tennis professional, and the director of college entrance exam preparation at a boarding school in Florida.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the FBI, he would fly in, take the test for students in a hotel room, or sneak them the correct answers in the exam room, or inflate their scores when they finished. Sometimes he would be given a sample of the teen's handwriting so he could copy it.\n",
    "Riddell did not know the questions in advance, according to Andrew Lelling, US attorney for the District of Massachusetts. He was \"just a really smart guy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not yet known how Huffman first came into contact with Singer.\n",
    "In 2017, he visited the Los Angeles home she shares with her long-term partner, William H Macy, the star of Shameless and Fargo, the court documents say.\n",
    "The couple - who met in the early 80s and married in 1997 - are not usually caught in negative headlines. Macy's hobbies reportedly include woodturning and playing the ukulele, while Huffman has been running a wholesome parenting site, What The Flicka, based on her childhood nickname.\n",
    "They have been known to post loving messages to each other on social media.\n",
    "Early on Tuesday morning, FBI agents turned up at their door.\n",
    "Only Huffman was indicted. The crime she stands accused of relates to mail fraud, which is when communication methods are used to conduct a scheme that intentionally deprives another of property or honest services. Macy has not been charged.\n",
    "Neither has commented publicly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The couple made a $15,000 payment to the Key Worldwide Foundation for their older daughter's exam scheme, according to court documents.\n",
    "In an art-mirrors-life twist, it was the exact same amount that Huffman's character in Desperate Housewives had paid to a headmaster in an episode about corrupt schools admissions.\n",
    "In real life, her older daughter's exam score jumped 400 points - a huge leap - after Singer's involvement, it is claimed.\n",
    "If those claims are proven, Huffman and Macy appear to have secured a bargain. Many people paid hundreds of thousands for Singer's help. He usually paid $10,000 to the surrogate test-taker alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sports scam\n",
    "Academic manipulation was only one side of this story, and the alleged sports scam was even more outrageous.\n",
    "Singer was taking students with no prowess, and turning them into sporting stars on their applications, it is claimed.\n",
    "In some cases he would arrange for their heads to be Photoshopped on to more sporty bodies. In others, their basic stats would be manipulated - one basketball player had his height changed from 5ft 5in to 6ft 1in, presumably betting on a once-you're-in-you're-in outcome.\n",
    "Police found their first strong piece of evidence of this scheme during a wiretapped encounter in a hotel room in Boston, Massachusetts, according to the Boston Globe.\n",
    "The newspaper says that investigators had been working on an entirely different story - alleged fraud in the stock market - when they received an unexpected tip.\n",
    "A financial executive told them a sports coach from Yale University, Rudolph \"Rudy\" Meredith, asked for a bribe to help the businessman's daughter gain admittance to the Ivy League school.\n",
    "The executive agreed to wear a recording device and meet Meredith, who then offered to designate the young woman as a member of his soccer team.\n",
    "Meredith - as well as Singer and Riddell - have been working with the police, hoping to reduce their sentences.\n",
    "Sports bring in such huge amounts of money and prestige to US universities that they will often lower academic requirements to bring in new talent.\n",
    "\"Student athletes often have excellent leadership qualities and excel both in the classroom and on the field, recognising that makes sense for colleges looking for the best students,\" says Eric Yaverbaum, author of Life's Little College Admissions Insights.\n",
    "\"The hard work it requires to be a student athlete is what makes the fact that some of these parents took advantage of this route so disturbing. It's appalling that some parents and coaches betrayed those students by buying and selling those coveted positions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The daughters of Full House actress Lori Loughlin and fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli were not outstanding sportswomen.\n",
    "However, the couple allegedly spent $500,000 to get them into University of Southern California by presenting them as accomplished rowers. They have not commented since the charge were filed.\n",
    "\n",
    "After getting her place, their youngest daughter, Olivia Jade, made matters worse by bragging online, saying she would rather be concentrating on her Instagram career. She is an influencer and has 1.3 million followers.\n",
    "\"I don't know how much of school I'm gonna attend but I'm gonna go in and talk to my deans and everyone, and hope that I can try and balance it all,\" she said on her YouTube channel. \"But I do want the experience of like game days, partying… I don't really care about school, as you guys all know.\"\n",
    "She has since apologised for her comments, but the backlash has been huge.\n",
    "It is not clear how much any of the children knew about the alleged plots. According to the court documents, some were involved, at least to a certain degree, while others were in the dark.\n",
    "\"[The entire scandal] is a perfect example of the entitlement that comes with wealth and privilege,\" adds author Eric Yaverbaum.\n",
    "\"We knew the system was unfair (after all, wealthy parents can pay for multiple test retakes and expensive tutoring, and the wealthiest can pledge large donations to a school just as their children are applying), but we didn't know wealthy parents were taking it even further. In either case, it only reiterates the need for the admissions process to be re-evaluated.\"\n",
    "In recent days, the US media has uncovered that Loughlin's Full House character, Aunt Becky, was also involved in a school cheating story - perhaps indicating just how common the idea is, at least in theory.\n",
    "In real life, however, the story unfolding in the news has outdone the scriptwriters.\n",
    "Though the focus may have been on the two actresses so far, the rest of the cast of real-life characters is almost as intriguing.\n",
    "Other parents indicted include a self-help author, a casino operator and a Napa Valley vineyard owner.\n",
    "One of the many questions outstanding is - who will play whom in the inevitable TV adaptation?\n",

    "article['title'] = \"Pimco’s Ties to Architect of College-Admissions Scam Ran Deep\"\n",
    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "Pacific Investment Management Co. is facing its most turbulent stretch in five years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two months ago, the nationwide college-admissions scam implicated the firm’s former chief executive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then, Pimco’s staff—and even clients of the firm—have learned that the central figure of the scam gave presentations on site to employees at one of the world’s biggest bond managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In late April current CEO Emmanuel Roman stepped in to address the rising anxiety about whether more employees would be ensnared. “These are not my values, and they are not your values,” Mr. Roman said to employees in the second-floor auditorium of the firm’s Southern California headquarters.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The true test of a person’s character is what he does when no one is watching,” Mr. Roman added, quoting John Wooden, the famed University of California, Los Angeles, basketball coach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Former Pimco CEO Douglas Hodge, who ceded his post to Mr. Roman in 2016 and left the firm in late 2017, was charged along with dozens of other parents in the federal investigation dubbed Operation Varsity Blues. The scheme’s central architect, William “Rick” Singer, had based his operations here, in the same coastal community Pimco calls home.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to an FBI affidavit, Mr. Hodge paid Mr. Singer hundreds of thousands of dollars to help his children get into college. Last month, Mr. Hodge pleaded not guilty to charges of money-laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit fraud. Mr. Hodge has said he plans to defend himself against the charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer has pleaded guilty to four counts, including racketeering conspiracy and money-laundering conspiracy, and is awaiting sentencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Mr. Hodge wasn’t the only Pimco executive who hired Mr. Singer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer came to Pimco’s offices to speak to employees in 2015 after a recommendation from Mr. Hodge, people familiar with the matter said. Seven years earlier, Mr. Singer was also brought in, this time at the recommendation of another Pimco executive, William Powers. Mr. Powers represents a second, previously unreported link between the firm and Mr. Singer. In an interview, Mr. Powers said that the admissions counselor never engaged in illegal activities on his behalf and that he didn’t remember suggesting Mr. Singer should speak at Pimco.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some employees at Pimco say the chatter over the probe—and speculation over who else had used Mr. Singer—has been a distraction from work.\n",
    "\n",
    "One pension-fund consultant, whose clients have money with Pimco, said his firm has asked the company about the possibility that current employees may be drawn into the scandal, and what that would mean for the bond manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "People familiar with the matter said the firm’s executives have fielded similar questions from other investing clients. So far, no clients have said they were pulling money in response to the admissions case, one person said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“While this alleged behavior relates to the private affairs of a former employee, any current employee found to have engaged in this type of behavior would have no place at the firm,” a Pimco spokesman said in a statement. “As part of our own due diligence, Pimco with the assistance of external counsel has reviewed the circumstances of any current employees who we believed may have had contact with Mr. Singer or his college-counseling service.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Pimco said that it knows some employees had used Mr. Singer but that it had no reason to believe they received anything other than legitimate counseling. A lawyer for Mr. Singer declined to comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The admissions scandal represents the biggest diversion inside Pimco since a rift between former investment chief Bill Gross and his colleagues led to Mr. Gross’s 2014 departure. The firm lost billions in assets in the wake of Mr. Gross’s exit. It has since steadied itself, winning back some of that money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving Pimco past this latest setback, executives said, may not be as straightforward. The scandal is both safely outside Pimco’s core business and burrowed deeply into the wealthy Orange County community the firm calls home. And the fact that it pertains to private lives—how far parents are willing to go to help their children—and not to professional duties has made it difficult for Pimco executives to probe potential concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to U.S. authorities, Mr. Hodge exchanged emails with Mr. Singer in February 2008 over his oldest daughter’s interest in Georgetown University. Mr. Singer assured Mr. Hodge a Georgetown contact would “work with us.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The emails would mark the earliest instance of Mr. Singer’s “side-door” strategy cited in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s affidavit and, according to prosecutors, the first of four transactions Mr. Hodge pursued with the adviser. Mr. Singer admitted to bribing college coaches to designate applicants as recruited athletes even when they didn’t play sports competitively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Hodge’s lawyers are scheduled to return to Boston federal court in early June for a status conference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Powers, Pimco’s former co-head of mortgages, recommended Mr. Singer to Mr. Hodge. Mr. Powers said he and Mr. Hodge had been friends for decades at the time of the recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Powers said Mr. Singer had helped his daughters with college admissions and said Mr. Singer never crossed the line. “Rick Singer, before he went to the dark side, was a fabulous resource,” Mr. Powers said. “I told [Mr. Hodge] he had been helpful to my daughters, and I recommended him.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Powers, who retired from Pimco in 2010, had suggested to the firm’s head of human resources to bring Mr. Singer to Pimco’s headquarters for a presentation on college admissions in June 2008, people familiar with the matter said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer then began to pitch the HR chief, James Ward, on a more lucrative partnership, under which his services would be offered as a perk to Pimco’s executives. Put off by what he considered an aggressive push, Mr. Ward told Mr. Singer Pimco wasn’t interested, said one person familiar with the discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, Mr. Singer suggested on his website that his business was working with Pimco and others to “utilize the life-coaching model for employees’ private wealth management clients and executives as a corporate benefit.”\n",
    "\n",
    "A Pimco spokesman said the company never had such an arrangement with Mr. Singer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer eventually moved his headquarters from Sacramento, Calif., to Newport Beach, and forged a deeper relationship with Mr. Hodge. Mr. Hodge allegedly paid Mr. Singer $400,000 to help secure admissions for two of his children at the University of Southern California, in 2013 and 2015, according to the affidavit.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Need to start discussion about the next one,” Mr. Hodge wrote to Mr. Singer in July 2013, according to the affidavit.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time, Mr. Hodge, who adopted two of his seven children from a Moroccan orphanage, was approaching the pinnacle of his career. When then-CEO of Pimco, Mohamed El-Erian, resigned in January 2014 amid tension with Mr. Gross, Mr. Hodge was tabbed his successor. Mr. Gross left that September.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Mr. Hodge raced to steady the firm following Mr. Gross’s exit, he was working again with Mr. Singer. Mr. Singer pitched Mr. Hodge’s son to USC as a football recruit, prosecutors said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer made his second presentation at Pimco in February 2015, a Pimco spokesman said. The following month, Mr. Hodge’s son was admitted to USC. He never played football with the university, according to prosecutors.\n",

    "\n",
    "One New York law-firm co-chairman allegedly paid $75,000 to an admissions consultant so his daughter could fly to Los Angeles and take the ACT in a private room last December, accompanied by a proctor who had been paid to correct her errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another family allegedly made a $400,000 contribution to a sham charity in 2016, with a portion of the funds funneled to the then-head tennis coach at Georgetown University, in exchange for having their daughter tagged as a recruited athlete. She was admitted to the school.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joseph Bonavolonta, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Boston field office, described on Tuesday a “culture of corruption and greed that created an uneven playing field for students trying to get into these schools the right way, through hard work, good grades and community service.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The sprawling case, the result of a 10-month multiagency federal investigation dubbed Operation Varsity Blues that led to charges against actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, lays bare a privileged world of high anxiety and high net worth. Operating in a universe where high school graduates are expected to go on to top colleges, a rejection letter isn’t an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "But with many selective schools boasting record high application volume and record low admission rates—in the low single digits at Stanford University and some Ivy League institutions—admission is far from a sure thing for even the most privileged or qualified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond paying for legitimate test-prep courses or donating to their alma maters in the hopes of getting a leg up—common practice in some circles—the 33 parents named in federal indictments Tuesday allegedly funneled at least $25 million through a fraudulent college-counseling service to get their children into colleges including Yale University, Stanford and University of California, Los Angeles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those charged Tuesday include Ms. Huffman of “Desperate Housewives” and Ms. Loughlin of “Full House”; Gordon Caplan, co-chairman of New York law firm Willkie Farr; former Pacific Investment Management Co. Chief Executive Douglas Hodge; and Greg Abbott, CEO of International Dispensing Corp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also charged was Bill McGlashan, founder and managing partner of TPG Growth, the arm of the private-equity firm that invests in fast-growing companies such as Airbnb Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.\n",
    "\n",
    "TPG said Mr. McGlashan was placed on administrative leave. A PIMCO spokesman declined to comment about Mr. Hodge’s alleged involvement in the scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors said the college-counseling operation, which played out from 2011 until last month, involved paying admissions-test administrators to help students raise their test scores by either having someone else take the test, or correcting answers before they were submitted. Prosecutors also said some of the people bribed varsity coaches and administrators to admit their children as recruited athletes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors said it appeared the universities themselves weren’t involved in the scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ringleader, college-counseling consultant William Rick Singer, pleaded guilty Tuesday to racketeering conspiracy and other crimes. He admitted facilitating the fraud through the Edge College & Career Network LLC, also known as the Key, in Newport Beach, Calif. Mr. Singer would likely face 15 to 19.5 years in prison under sentencing guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Loughlin, who was named as a defendant with her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, allegedly paid bribes totaling $500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits to the University of Southern California’s crew team, even though neither participated in the sport. Ms. Loughlin hadn’t yet been arrested as of Tuesday afternoon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Huffman and her spouse—actor William H. Macy, who isn’t named as a defendant—allegedly paid $15,000 to work with the admissions consultant and help one daughter cheat on the SAT in late 2017; Ms. Huffman, who was arrested Tuesday, considered doing the same for her younger daughter but decided against it, according to the affidavit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A representative for Ms. Loughlin declined to comment. Ms. Huffman couldn’t be reached for comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The investigation, by the Justice Department, FBI and Internal Revenue Service, began in May. U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said it remains active, and more parents and coaches could be charged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer says on his firm’s website that he set up his business 25 years ago to help students navigate the tricky world of college admissions. It is dotted with testimonials to his good work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In court Tuesday, Mr. Singer admitted it was a sham, but a seductive one for his wealthy clients. Some students can gain admissions through the “front door,” where students get into college on merit, or the “back door” where parents make hefty donations to increase chances of admission. His path offered better odds, he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I created a side door—a sure thing,” he said. “That is what made it so attractive—I created a guarantee.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer said Tuesday he would have clients’ children seek doctors’ notes claiming learning disabilities or other issues, which would allow them to take SAT or ACT tests at sites where Mr. Singer could install a proctor who had been paid to either take tests on the students’ behalf or correct wrong answers. He said he bribed test administrators working with sites in Houston and Los Angeles, and parents would fly their children in to take the tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those services generally went for $15,000 to $75,000, according to prosecutors, with proctors receiving a small cut.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two test administrators for the ACT and College Board were charged in the racketeering conspiracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Caplan, a top private-equity lawyer, is among those who allegedly tried the side door. He allegedly paid Mr. Singer $75,000 to have another person take the ACT for his daughter in December, asking that she get a score in the low 30s out of a possible 36—he didn’t want it to be so high as to seem suspicious, according to a conversation recorded by law enforcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Caplan said in another recorded call in July, “I’m not worried about the moral issue here. I’m worried about the, if she’s caught doing that, you know, she’s finished.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Willkie Farr had no comment, and Mr. Caplan didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer also allegedly helped parents work with college coaches to claim admission spots reserved for recruited athletes, staging photos of the teens playing sports or photo-shopping their faces onto stock photos of young athletes and creating fake credentials showing their athletic prowess.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coaches who allegedly received payments then used the athletic profiles to persuade others at the schools to admit the students, Mr. Lelling said. Most of the coaches both gave money to their sports programs and kept some for themselves, he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coaches and at least one administrator participated in the scheme, prosecutors said. Those charged with racketeering included the former head men’s and women’s tennis coach at Georgetown; a senior associate athletic director, water polo and women’s soccer coaches at USC; the men’s soccer coach at UCLA; and the Wake Forest University women’s volleyball coach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wake Forest put its head volleyball coach on administrative leave and retained outside counsel, USC announced an internal investigation and a broad review of its admissions processes, and the University of Texas in Austin placed its men’s tennis coach on administrative leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors said the head women’s soccer coach at Yale accepted a $400,000 bribe in exchange for admitting a candidate as a recruited athlete, even though she allegedly didn’t even play competitive soccer. After the student was admitted, her parents paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million, including about $900,000 to his charity, which purported to help underserved youth but funneled funds to bribe college officials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yale said it is the victim of a crime and would continue to cooperate with the probe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Georgetown’s former tennis coach didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did the Yale soccer coach Rudy Meredith or USC water polo coach Jovan Vavic.\n",
    "\n",
    "John Vandemoer, the 41-year-old former head sailing coach at Stanford University, pleaded guilty Tuesday to one count of racketeering conspiracy. Prosecutors said there were no allegations he kept the money for himself. According to court records, during the summer of 2017 and the following May, Mr. Vandemoer agreed to designate two of Mr. Singer’s clients as recruits in return for payments, including one of $500,000, to the Stanford sailing program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neither student ended up going to Stanford, but Mr. Singer still allegedly paid $160,000 to the sailing program, according to prosecutors. Mr. Vandemoer agreed with Mr. Singer that the payment “would serve as a ‘deposit’ for a future student’s purported recruitment,” the federal documents allege.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement Tuesday, Stanford said Mr. Vandemoer has been terminated and neither student attended the school.\n",

    "Prosecutors alleged that Mr. Singer’s nonprofit organization, Key Worldwide Foundation, was used as a front for many of the bribes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Abbott of International Dispensing and his wife, Marcia, were both charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud. Mr. Abbott said his family had spoken to the FBI about the alleged cheating scandal, and on Tuesday called the situation “insane.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Abbott allegedly made a $50,000 donation to Mr. Singer’s charity last April in exchange for having someone correct their daughter’s answers after she finished taking the ACT, according to an affidavit filed in the case. Prosecutors said the money was wired from an Abbott Family Foundation brokerage account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another donation, for $75,000, was made in September, allegedly in exchange for helping the daughter cheat on SAT mathematics and literature subject tests.\n",

    "“It was so funny ’cause the kids will call me and say, ‘Maybe I should do that again. I did pretty well, and if I took it again, I’ll do better even.’ Right? And they just have no idea that they didn’t even get the score that they thought they got,” Mr. Singer said, according to the affidavit.\n",

    "article['content'] = '''\n",
    "Georgetown University said Wednesday it would expel two students implicated in the college-admissions scandal—hours after one of the students sued the school for allegedly depriving him of due process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The move comes two months after federal investigators charged 50 people across the country in a scheme to secure spots at elite universities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Georgetown didn’t name the students who face dismissal. But David Kenner, a lawyer for Adam Semprevivo, the student who sued the school, said he had received a notice of the school’s decision to rescind Mr. Semprevivo’s admission on Wednesday.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Semprevivo, of Los Angeles, had just completed his junior year at Georgetown and maintained a 3.18 grade point average, according to the lawsuit. Earlier this month, his father, Stephen Semprevivo, pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colleges have struggled with what to do about students whose parents have been implicated in the scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stanford and Yale have each rescinded the admission of one student they said got in under false pretenses. The University of Southern California said it froze some students’ accounts as it reviews the allegations. Many of the students weren’t aware of the scheme, while some others knew, prosecutors have said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Georgetown knew of problems with tennis coach Gordon Ernst’s recruiting practices before this year’s criminal charges, and Mr. Ernst was placed on leave in December 2017, according to the lawsuit. The university continued to accept tuition payments for Mr. Semprevivo and allowed him to take classes despite knowing of Mr. Ernst’s role in recruiting “student athletes” who weren’t actually being recruited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Semprevivo’s knowledge of the scheme is unclear, but he did forward an email, which was drafted by William “Rick” Singer—the California-based college counselor who has admitted to masterminding the scheme—to Mr. Ernst. Materials prepared by Mr. Singer stated that Mr. Semprevivo was a tennis player and painted him as a fierce competitor, according to the lawsuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Georgetown cannot comment on pending litigation, said university spokeswoman Meghan Dubyak in an email.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Applicants to Georgetown affirm that the information and statements contained in their applications are true, correct and complete,” Ms. Dubyak said in the statement. “Knowingly misrepresenting or falsifying credentials in an application can be cause for rescinding the admission of the student and dismissal from Georgetown.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Mr. Semprevivo and the other student were given “multiple opportunities to respond” and provide information to Georgetown, Ms. Dubyak said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lawsuit seeks to prevent Georgetown from imposing academic discipline against Mr. Semprevivo based on the university’s “arbitrary and capricious” investigative process. It also seeks to prevent the university from nullifying credits Mr. Semprevivo received while at Georgetown, and from prohibiting him from transferring those.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Semprevivo hasn’t been charged in the case, nor have any other students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Kenner, his lawyer, said the legal team is working on filing an amended complaint given Mr. Semprevivo’s dismissal on Wednesday from Georgetown.\n",

    "Their parents have been indicted or pleaded guilty in connection with cheating to get them into college. Now what about the children?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lying to get into college isn’t necessarily a crime, but making misrepresentations on an application can be grounds for disciplinary action by a school, including expulsion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stanford University and Yale University each have rescinded the admission of one student they said got in under false pretenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wake Forest University, meanwhile, said that while one student was allegedly admitted because her family bribed a coach there, the school concluded that she didn’t seem to be in on the plot, so won’t be disciplined. The University of Southern California froze some students’ accounts as it reviews the allegations, it said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since federal authorities detailed a sprawling scheme last month, universities around the country have been scrambling to figure out which students may have benefited—and determine how much the students actually knew about their parents’ alleged activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fifty people, including 33 parents, were charged last month for their alleged roles in a scam by which California college-admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer said he helped wealthy parents get their children into selective schools either by creating fake athletic profiles and bribing coaches to list the students as recruited athletes, or boosting their ACT or SAT scores by having someone fix their wrong answers. Thirteen parents so far have said they intend to plead guilty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authorities said at least 40 students were admitted to schools as a result of the athletics fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the students weren’t in on the scheme, said Andrew Lelling, U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts, who is leading the investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way Mr. Singer tried to hide the cheating from some students was by having his office submit their applications when he was pitching them as recruited athletes. This let him slip in those fabricated details at the last minute, and allowed students to sign their applications thinking the material inside was accurate, according to recorded conversations and emails detailed in a Federal Bureau of Investigation affidavit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer, who has pleaded guilty to four charges, also passed some conditional letters of admission—given early to recruited athletes—to the parents, not the students, so students wouldn’t find out until the regular admissions notification day, according to the affidavit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, the 204-page affidavit indicated that many of the children who allegedly benefited from their parents’ actions weren’t in the dark.\n",
    "\n",
    "A son of defendant Stephen Semprevivo, an executive at an outsourcing company, was allegedly copied in on an August 2015 email from Mr. Singer. The subject line was “Dear Coach Ernst,” and authorities said the message contained a note the son was instructed to send to Georgetown University’s tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, highlighting his summer tennis activity. Authorities said the son didn’t play competitive tennis, and his applications to schools other than Georgetown made no mention of the sport.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Knowingly misrepresenting or falsifying credentials in an application can be cause for rescinding the admission of the student and dismissal from Georgetown,” the school said. “We have reviewed all available information related to Mr. Ernst’s alleged fraudulent actions and have contacted current students who may have been implicated. Each student case is being addressed individually.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Semprevivo has agreed to plead guilty to one felony charge. His attorney didn’t respond to a request to comment. His son couldn’t be reached for comment. Mr. Ernst has pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy. An attorney for Mr. Ernst didn’t respond to a request to comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The family of the student that Yale expelled hasn’t been identified or charged in the case. Authorities said the family paid $1.2 million to Mr. Singer, who in turn paid $400,000 to Yale’s former women’s soccer coach, Rudolph “Rudy” Meredith, to list the student as a recruited player. She enrolled in fall 2018. Mr. Meredith has pleaded guilty to two charges related to his role in the scheme.\n",

    "Federal authorities were pursuing a securities fraud case last spring when a person involved, a financial executive hoping for leniency, said he had information of great interest on another matter, according to people familiar with the investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The executive told investigators that the head women’s soccer coach at Yale University had sought a bribe in return for getting his daughter admitted to the Ivy League school, a person familiar with the investigation said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authorities zeroed in on the coach who began cooperating in what federal investigators said was the biggest college-admissions fraud ever prosecuted.\n",
    "\n",
    "From 2011 to 2018, prosecutors say, parents paid a total of $25 million to William Singer, a college-admissions consultant, to bribe coaches and administrators to designate their children as top recruits in such sports as football, water polo, soccer, track and volleyball at universities including the University of Southern California, Georgetown and Wake Forest. Some parents also allegedly paid Mr. Singer as much as $75,000 for test-cheating services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authorities have charged 33 parents who allegedly paid for illegal services to get their children into colleges; three people who were allegedly paid to fraudulently raise scores on SAT and ACT college-entrance exams, as well as nine college coaches and five others.\n",
    "\n",
    "A day after charges were unveiled, the new details revealed more about the origins and breadth of an investigation that snared families at the highest economic echelons, accused of pushing their way ahead of other college applicants with lies, bribes and cheating.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case immediately became a national conversation, touching on class, merit and a hint of comeuppance. Most of the accused parents didn’t reveal to the children the lengths they would go to land a seat at a big-name university.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most brazen deceptions weren’t easy to hide. A school counselor, for instance, wanted to know why one student was being recruited by a college water polo team when their high school didn’t even offer the sport.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors said the plot attracted parents from affluent communities in California: Del Mar, Newport Beach, Beverly Hills, San Francisco, Atherton, Mill Valley and Palo Alto; and in the east, Greenwich, Conn., and New York City. The families spanned Silicon Valley to Hollywood to Wall Street.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What we do is help the wealthiest families in the U.S. get their kids into school,” Mr. Singer told parent Gordon Caplan last June in a recorded call transcribed in a government affidavit released in Boston this week. “They want guarantees. They want this thing done.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The response from Mr. Caplan, co-chairman of New York law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, echoed other calls with parents, according to the affidavit transcripts: “To be honest, it feels a little weird. But…What do I need to do?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Caplan declined to comment. Other parents named in court documents declined to comment, didn’t respond to requests for comment or couldn’t be reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial tip led investigators to Rudy Meredith, the head coach of women’s soccer at Yale. He had worked with Mr. Singer in January 2018 to get the daughter of a California family into Yale by pretending she was a soccer player, according to prosecutors. The family paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million, according to the affidavit; Mr. Meredith’s share was $400,000. The family wasn’t identified. Mr. Meredith didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In April, Mr. Meredith met with the tipster parent, who was wearing a wire, at a hotel room in Boston, the person familiar with the matter said. During that meeting, Mr. Meredith offered a place at Yale for the parent’s daughter in exchange for $450,000, according to the person and court documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterward, Mr. Meredith began cooperating, authorities said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tipster parent has not been charged in the college case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiagency federal investigation, named Operation Varsity Blues, received court approval to tap Mr. Singer’s phone in June. Investigators secretly recorded conversations between Mr. Singer and at least 16 client families over the next few months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer allegedly offered two services: Fraudulently boost children’s entrance-exam scores, or pay to have them falsely identified as a recruited athlete, a more expensive but guaranteed path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defendants recorded on calls include actress Felicity Huffman, former Pacific Investment Management Co. CEO Douglas Hodge, vintner Agustin Huneeus Jr. and private-equity investor John Wilson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Federal agents alerted Mr. Singer that he was under surveillance in September. He learned of the federal and grand-jury investigation into his operation, according to prosecutors, and began cooperating.\n",
    "\n",
    "“They had me wired to go into some folks’ homes, plus my calls were being taped,” Mr. Singer said in court Tuesday. At first, Mr. Singer tipped off six families of the investigation, prosecutors said. In one case, according to his court testimony, he arrived early to a student’s home and told the father that he was being recorded and urged him to “not say anything that would be harmful to you guys.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer said in court, “I am totally wrong, and I did that kind of situation on multiple occasions to multiple families.”\n",
    "\n",
    "At the request of investigators, Mr. Singer reached out to past clients, including former casino executive Gamal Abdelaziz and real estate developer Robert Flaxman. He recounted on the recorded calls their past transactions, explaining that his charity was being audited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer had long assured worried clients that hundreds of other families had taken advantage of his clandestine services. Yet, as more families engaged Mr. Singer’s Edge College & Career Network, LLC, the secret seemed harder and harder to keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "In late 2017, a guidance counselor at the Buckley School in Sherman Oaks, a suburb of Los Angeles, wanted to know why USC was recruiting Matteo Sloane as a water polo player. The high school didn’t even have a team.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boy’s father, Devin Sloane, founder and chief executive of aquaTECTURE, a Los Angeles-based company that invests in water-treatment systems, had hired Mr. Singer to bribe a USC official to identify Matteo as an athletic recruit, the affidavit said.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the campus officials accused of working with Mr. Singer, Donna Heinel, then the senior associate athletic director at USC, sent an email to the university’s admissions director to explain the discrepancy, according to the affidavit. “He plays at LA Water Polo Club during the year and travels international during the summer with the youth junior team in Italy,” she wrote on April 11. “I don’t know if the people at [his high school] are unaware.”\n",
    "\n",
    "She added, “He is small but he has a long torso but short strong legs plus he is fast which helps him win the draws to start play after goals are scored.”\n",
    "\n",
    "USC’s admissions director, not named in court papers, agreed to pass that information along. “They seemed unusually skeptical,” the admissions official said of the Buckley School. A spokeswoman for Buckley didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Heinel warned Mr. Singer in a voice mail that same day: “I just don’t want anybody going into” the high schools, “You know, yelling at counselors. That’ll shut everything—that’ll shut everything down,” according to the affidavit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In July, the scheme was nearly exposed by a curious USC adviser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thomas Kimmel, the son of defendant Elisabeth Kimmel, expressed confusion when he was asked about being a track athlete. Mr. Kimmel allegedly didn’t know it, according to the affidavit, but he had been admitted to USC last year after his mother, who owns a media company, used Mr. Singer to bribe Ms. Heinel. Thomas, according to his paperwork, was a pole vaulter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer and his associates had crafted a profile of the boy as an elite athlete that included a photo of an actual vaulter. The boy’s high school, the Bishop’s School in La Jolla, Calif., had no record of his track-and-field feats, prosecutors said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Kimmel described what happened to Mr. Singer, a phone call recorded by authorities: “So she goes, ‘It has it down that you’re a track athlete.’ And he said, ‘Well I’m not.’ She goes, ‘Oh, okay, well I have to look into that.’”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer reassured the mother that if the adviser poked around more, she would end up speaking with Ms. Heinel, who has since been charged with conspiracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer relied on referrals from a circle of affluent parents. He said in recorded calls last year that he had helped 760 students in the previous school year get into college through what he called the “side door.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Greg Abbott, CEO of International Dispensing Corp. , told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that he and his wife had heard about Mr. Singer through a network of New York City mothers: “They all say he’s the best.”\n",
    "\n",
    "One parent, William McGlashan Jr., wanted to help his son into USC, and he didn’t want the boy to know how, according to the government affidavit unsealed in Boston this week.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a conversation recorded by authorities, Mr. McGlashan was quoted a fee of $250,000 by Mr. Singer, who started his company, Edge College & Career Network.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I would do that in a heartbeat,” said Mr. McGlashan, of Mill Valley, Calif., the managing partner of private-equity firm TPG Growth. He had already paid Mr. Singer $50,000 for an expert to surreptitiously correct his son’s college-entrance exam, according to government allegations. He would pay even more to have his son photoshopped into a star kicker for the USC football team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Late last summer, Mr. McGlashan sent Mr. Singer sports photos of his son for an admissions package, intended to cast the teen as a recruit to the football team.The boy’s school, Marin Academy in Northern California, had no football team. But, Mr. McGlashan said, “He does have really strong legs…Pretty funny. The way the world works these days is unbelievable.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. McGlashan was put on administrative leave Tuesday by TPG.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Huneeus, another defendant, spoke about Mr. Singer’s services with Mr. McGlashan, whose son attended the same school as Mr. Huneeus’s daughter, Agustina. A spokesman for the school, Marin Academy, said there was no indication anyone who works at the school knew of the alleged scam.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recorded call with Mr. Singer, Mr. McGlashan lamented that Mr. Huneeus was “not discreet at all.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Huneeus allegedly paid Mr. Singer $50,000 to have someone sit with his daughter and correct answers while she took the SAT at a Los Angeles-area test center in March.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Huneeus also allegedly bribed Ms. Heinel and USC’s water polo coach to secure a spot for his daughter as a recruited player.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Huffman, the actress, had allegedly paid $15,000 for Mr. Singer’s services to help her older daughter score well on a college entrance exam and was in talks with him for help with her second daughter. In a call recorded in December, her husband—actor William H. Macy, who hasn’t been charged—said the girl was interested in Georgetown, among other colleges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In February while making arrangements for Ms. Huffman’s daughter to take the test in March, Mr. Singer said for the girl to get into Georgetown, she would have to score in the 1400-plus range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Huffman told Mr. Singer that her daughter had scored around a 1200 in a practice SAT test with a tutor.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I just didn’t know if it’d be odd for [the tutor] if we go, ‘Oh, she did this in— in March 9th, but she did so much better in May,’” Ms. Huffman said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer said he didn’t think the tutor would notice. The parents decided not to pay for help cheating on the entrance exam for the younger child, prosecutors said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer pleaded guilty to four charges Tuesday, including racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and obstruction of justice. John Vandemoer, the former head sailing coach at Stanford, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The investigation, which also involved the Internal Revenue Service, is ongoing and could implicate more coaches and parents. The IRS called the operation a sweeping financial crime with Mr. Singer and others conspiring to not only make and receive bribes but to funnel the funds through a bogus charity to dodge taxes.\n",

    "Sitting in a plush chair and wearing a white blouse buttoned up to the neck, the young woman looks into the camera, smiles and offers advice about getting into a top American university.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Some people think, ‘Didn’t you get into Stanford because your family is rich?’” the woman, Yusi Zhao, says in a video posted on social media. It wasn’t like that, she says. The admissions officers “have no idea who you are.”\n",
    "\n",
    "She adds, “I tested into Stanford through my own hard work.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The video was recorded in the summer before Ms. Zhao began her freshman year, in 2017. It now stands in sharp contrast with recent news: that her parents paid $6.5 million to a college consultant at the center of an international college admissions scheme, according to a person with direct knowledge of the investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors say that the consultant, William Singer, tried to get Ms. Zhao recruited to the Stanford sailing team, providing a fake list of sailing accomplishments and making a $500,000 donation to the sailing program after she was admitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The payment to Mr. Singer was by far the largest known in the case, and the disclosure immediately added Ms. Zhao and her family, pharmaceutical billionaires from China, to a cast of powerful figures swept up in the scandal, including two Hollywood actresses and prominent names from the American legal and business worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new turns in the investigation, including reports that another family from China paid $1.2 million in connection with their daughter’s application to Yale, have illuminated the global reach of Mr. Singer’s operation and the wealthy Chinese families eager to get their children into prestigious American universities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Singer was far from alone in trying to profit from soaring demand in China for the elite American college experience. Many Chinese families turn to middlemen, whose fees can be tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, like some of their counterparts in the college consulting industry in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "In China, a dizzying array of companies offer advisory services that range from the legitimate to the openly dishonest — promising, as Mr. Singer did with some of his clients, guaranteed admission to certain schools in exchange for payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "A private club down the street from the Zhao family home outside Beijing was lined with advertisements for admissions consulting and SAT test-prep services. One company, called Capstone, offered “100 percent university clients accepted into 40 Top U.S. Universities.” Across the street were several businesses offering university consulting and tutoring; one had posted a list of the colleges and boarding schools where its clients had been admitted: Yale, Brown, Andover, Groton.\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses like these have boomed in China as the number of Chinese international students has steadily grown in the United States. In 2017, there were more than 363,000 Chinese students enrolled in American universities, more than a third of all international students, according to the Institute of International Education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jack Chen, a marketing executive for the Institute of Chinese Language and Culture, which offers college consulting and tutoring, said companies like his help students get reference letters, write essays and prepare for interviews. They also advise children on how to build up their résumés to include charity work and competitions that separate them from their peers, he said.\n",

    "Mr. Chen said he knew of consulting companies that could find back doors into top universities in the United States, but he declined to disclose their names. He added that there used to be more of these services, but that American universities had cracked down after several cases of cheating by Chinese students on standardized exams and college applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it was perhaps the college consultants in the United States who had greater sway with Ms. Zhao’s parents, and the parents of the student in the Yale case, Sherry Guo. Both families pursued Mr. Singer’s services after meeting him through financial services companies in California, where he had formed relationships. Ms. Zhao’s family was introduced to him by an adviser at Morgan Stanley named Michael Wu, who the company said had been terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Federal prosecutors have so far charged 50 people in the admissions case, in which wealthy families are accused of cheating on college entrance exams and bribing college coaches to designate students as athletic recruits. Mr. Singer has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges, and has cooperated with the government in gathering evidence against his clients and others he is said to have worked with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prosecutors have not brought any charges against Ms. Zhao or her parents, nor against Ms. Guo or her parents. Both Ms. Zhao, who was a sophomore at Stanford, and Ms. Guo, who was a freshman at Yale, were expelled from their schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "A statement sent on behalf of Ms. Zhao’s mother by her lawyer, Vincent Law, said that Mrs. Zhao and her daughter were victims of Mr. Singer’s scheme, and that Mrs. Zhao had believed the $6.5 million was a legitimate donation to Stanford.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This generous act was not only done for the good of the school and its students, but also done out of the love and support of Yusi by a caring mother,” the statement said.\n",
    "\n",
    "It added that Mr. Singer had not offered guaranteed admission to any school and that her daughter had applied to and was accepted by a number of colleges “through ordinary channels.”\n",
    "\n",
    "A visit to the Zhao family home outside Beijing and a review of online records pointed to the world of luxury and privilege that Ms. Zhao had grown up in. But the family also publicly espoused an ethic of hard work and not falling back on inherited wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Ferrari, Tesla, Bentley and Land Rover sat parked outside the house, a California-style mansion surrounded by trees and a large hedge, in a gated development called Yosemite Villas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Zhao’s father, Zhao Tao, said in a 2015 profile of the family in a Chinese magazine that his children did not have their own fancy cars. “If they want to drive, they have to borrow one from me,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I really look down on those kids who don’t rely on their own abilities,” he added. “If I come across one, I give them a dressing down right away. I just can’t stand that type.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Zhao’s older sister, Zhao Yuchen, said in the same profile, “From early on we’ve been taught that the family’s money is the family’s and is none of our business. We can get the best education available, but if we want to live better off, we have to earn it ourselves. When we traveled, the adults went first class, for sure, but we kids had to ride economy in the back.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Zhao is the president and co-founder of Shandong Buchang Pharmaceuticals, a drug company that specializes in traditional Chinese medicines and health supplements. He started the company with his father in 1993, and it has become a family enterprise, employing Mr. Zhao’s brother, wife and elder daughter. A profile in Forbes lists Mr. Zhao’s net worth as $1.8 billion, describes him as a citizen of Singapore, and says he received an M.B.A. from Fordham University.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement released by the company on Friday, Mr. Zhao said: “The arrangements for my daughter’s studies in the United States are a matter for me and my family, and the source of the funds has nothing to do with Buchang Pharmaceuticals, and will not have any impact on the financial situation of Buchang Pharmaceuticals.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Zhao’s father, Zhao Buchang, was himself at one point accused of bribery: He was found by prosecutors to have paid $10,000 in 2002 to a senior official in China’s food and drug administration who was sentenced to death for corruption in 2007.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Zhao is also on the board of a group, called Wisdom Valley in English, which says it provides support and advice for Chinese family businesses. Through that group, Mr. Zhao met and posed for a photograph with President Trump and Melania Trump in 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "His daughter went to elementary school in Beijing before going to England for the latter part of middle school and for high school, where she attended a prestigious boarding school.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a freshman at Stanford, Ms. Zhao was part of a selective academic-and-residential program called Structured Liberal Education, a yearlong intensive course in Western literature and culture and the history of ideas, according to Rob Reich, a professor of political science who has given lectures in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 90 freshmen in Structured Liberal Education live together and attend lectures by humanities scholars from across the university. According to its website, the program “encourages students to live a life of ideas in an atmosphere that emphasizes critical thinking and interpretation.”\n",
    "\n",
    "She also belonged to an organization called the Stanford Speakers Bureau, which brings high-profile speakers like Jennifer Lopez and Ban Ki Moon to campus.\n",
    "\n",
    "“She was very friendly — and very dedicated,” Alexa Ramachandran, 18, a freshman member, said of Ms. Zhao. “She would go around to the dorms, asking if there was anything more she could do for the club.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video Ms. Zhao made about getting into Stanford, which is over 90 minutes long, Ms. Zhao said that she rode horses in her spare time, and that she planned to take sociology classes at Stanford and return to China after graduating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Zhao repeatedly exhorted her viewers to work hard and believe in themselves, using her own journey as a lesson. She said that she had been a mediocre student in elementary school and that her first ACT score had been unimpressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "“A lot of people told me, ‘You still want to get into Stanford, but, look, the entry rate for it is just 4 percent — just forget it,’” she said. After a year of strenuous study, she said, she took the test again and got a score of 33 out of 36.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Based on my experience of study, I want to tell you that really anyone can do it,” she went on. “I’m not the kind who was born with a very high I.Q. or who can score 33 or 36 in an exam just like that. But I made my way up step by step, through my hard work.”\n",
    "\n",
    "She decided to aim for American universities, she said, because they evaluated students not just based on test scores, but also on their extracurricular activities and personal statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It demands not only that you’re a good student, but also that you have personality,” she said. “You need to have a special skill.”\n",
